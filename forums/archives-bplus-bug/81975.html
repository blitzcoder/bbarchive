Sorry for the hassle!<br><br>******************************************<br><br>The Command Reference help file for Desktop and DesktopBuffer contain code that consistently Reboots my PC immediately when I run it.  This started happening with other code I wrote since about a week ago, usually when trying to copy from the desktop to a createdImage (in my general efforts to get or at least fake a transparent/semi-transparent background of a window/canvas).  But I'm just talking about the help file/command reference's code, in it's own file, nothing else, no more no less, it immediately causes my PC to reboot itself.  Monitor gets no signal for a second or two, I hear the HD stop and it starts up again with the fan and monitor displays boot sequence etc as it would normally boot when I turn it on/reboot it myself.<br><br>I copied and pasted the code, exactly as it is in the Help file.  The one where it copyrects a screenshot of the desktop and saves to c:\mydesktop.bmp, exactly as it is, no changes.  It just says in the description "Fun, but use with caution!"  What caution??  What are the dangers?  I imagine few others would have this problem but something is definitely screwy going on!

I haven't changed any hardware or added any drivers since this started happening (it also happens with other code eg that involves desktopbuffer and possibly createimage but this system crash is reproducible 100% with the Help Command Reference's code sample).  Searching my PC for ntoskrnl.exe gives back 3 entries in different directories, one dated 2003 other two dated 2007 and this problem only started happening in past week or so.  What could this be?? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
