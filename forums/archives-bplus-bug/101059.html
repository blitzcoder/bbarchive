I say so. I'm a blitzplus user. I have a say it what are bugs. <br></div><br><br>No you don't. Bugs are objective. Just because you don't understand the command does not make its behaviour buggy. Your program is improperly designed, and relying on what is more likely a bug in Blitz2D that has been corrected. If you say you want 1 + 1 to equal 3 because it would make your level loader work better, that doesn't make the result 2 buggy. FlushKeys is working as designed and documented. There is no fail here.<br><br><br><div class="quote"> Why randomly remove the keydown functionality of blitz until reactivation by a keyhit event? <br></div><br><br>Because you have <i>specifically requested it be removed</i> by <i>calling the function that requests the flag be removed</i>. This is <i>what the function does</i>. Again, this is like assigning a value to a variable then being surprised that it changed. If you don't want this to happen, <i>stop ordering it to happen</i>.<br><br><br><div class="quote"> randomly picked up this 'every frame' meme out your imagination <br></div><br><br>The only reason this is a problem in your <i>posted example in the OP</i> is because FlushKeys is in the loop body instead of before the loop body, when you have said that you want to flush events only that took place before the loop body. If you have more than one loop or rendering system in your project, whatever; you've described a situation where you only want events flushed at particular times, and are describing your solution as flushing events all the time, for some reason. Place FlushKeys before several loops or within conditionals or whatever as suits your program's actual structure, but the point is that your code as posted contains an <i>obvious logical error</i>, which is that you're issuing far more flush commands than you need and at times when they aren't wanted. You can completely solve the problem by fixing this logical error without needing to rely on a broken FlushKeys implementation.<br><br>Besides which there is a logical disconnect both in what you're writing and what you appear to want. In code: there is no reason to use FlushKeys with KeyDown at any time. They are not designed to work together anyway; one <i>prepares for</i> input and the other <i>directly handles</i> input. One is a setup command, one is a realtime command. There is no functionality overlap (KeyDown shouldn't be affected by what happened before the keypress anyway, so there is <i>no need</i> for a flush for it to work correctly; if there is, you're mixing multiple input methods, which never works). In what you want: for the user to have their relevant keystrokes recognised while deleting their irrelevant ones. This is logically incoherent.<br><br><br><div class="quote"> blitz shouldn't have any functionality that windows doesn't already provide is a bit dumb <br></div><br><br>My idea is that functions should behave as they're documented and intended. Absolutely nowhere does the documentation say that KeyDown generates a whole bunch of extra events and is therefore immune to event-flushing, and to implement this would require more code in the hidden layer than to not do it this way and assume extra behaviour that has not been suggested to exist. Therefore it makes no sense to assume that FlushKeys would not affect KeyDown. If you want this behaviour, use a single-point-of-input system and add it directly. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I think there's some confusion on what is the expected behavior of FlushKeys(). <br>FlushKeys() can only affect the behavior of KeyDown() calls that come after it and that query the state of a key that was pressed down on the keyboard before FlushKeys() was called.<br><br>When BlitzPlus polls the system for events, it uses the key-up and key-down events that your application received to mark a key as pressed down or released.<br>These events are "fire-once"; They come once per change of key state. So BlitzPlus knows a key is pressed when it receives a key-down event for it, and it will consider this key being pressed down all the time until it receives a key-up event for this key, indicating that it was released.<br><br>When you call FlushKeys(), BlitzPlus clears its own internal state variables for all keys. Subsequent calls to KeyDown() for the same key will all query its state variable, and these calls will yield 'False' even if the key is still being pressed on the keyboard. Your application only received a single message of key-down, and it was disregarded by BlitzPlus the moment you called FlushKeys().<br><br>KeyHit(), on the other hand, queries and then resets a different variable, one that stores the number of times a key was hit since the last call of KeyHit() to it. It does not consider the key's state, so it's not influenced by FlushKeys() at all. <br>If KeyHit() influences FlushKeys()+KeyDown() behavior in any way in Blitz2D, it's most likely because it uses an asynchronous or at least different input scheme than that of BlitzPlus\Blitz3D\BlitzMax.<br><br>- - - - -<br>If you want your program to enable the user to have immediate control as soon as the gameplay starts, then as soon as the user hits the PLAY button (or whatever button that immediately precedes gameplay), <i>don't</i> call a FlushKeys() or any keys that were pressed before it will be ignored. <br>This is so for any Blitz product. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
