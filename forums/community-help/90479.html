(the only real differences between the 550D and the 7D are that the 550D has a smaller body, plastic instead of metal, and a lower burst rate when taking multiple images)<br><br>The kit lens that comes with the 500D / 550D is the canon 18-55mm IS, which is actually surprisingly good for a stock lens. It has hardware image stabilization built-in, which means that it is much esier to snap sharp pictures without using a tripod. Especially at higher zoom levels, without IS it's really easy to end up with blurry images due to minor camera movement.<br>The basic lens is not going to give you any massive amount of zoom power though, it's more geared towards wide-angle than big close-up zoom.<br><br>Two websites I'd suggest if you're looking into purchasing a SLR camera and/or lensen:<br><br><a href="http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/XSI/XSIA.HTM" target="_blank">http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/XSI/XSIA.HTM</a><br>(Nice thing about that one is that they have sample images of the same still life scene with countless cameras and lenses, so you can do a one-on-one comparison)<br><a href="http://slrgear.com" target="_blank">http://slrgear.com</a> <br>(especially nice when comparing the sharpness of varying lenses) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Going beyond that threshold, and you'll only be adding noise and no detail.<br><br>Many of the lower end cameras advertise high megapixels because if joe consumer sees a 7 megapixel and a 10 megapixel camera for the same price, most people will just reach for the 10 megapixel one without questioning it.<br><br>But depending on the sensor size, with all other components and features being identical, the 7 megapixel camera may very well create superior images compared to the 10 megapixel one.

When you zoom in/out, the projected size of the image on the sensor changes, and you can compare these sizes with eachother to see how much of a zoom you have.<br><br>Most digital SLR cameras use an APS-C sensor, which is smaller than a standard 35mm negative: You get a so-called crop factor of 1.6x. 35mm * 1.6 = 56mm,  meaning that on those cameras a view at 55mm is roughly the 'real' size of an object: if you look through the camera, the objects appear about the same size as they appear to your other eye that's not looking through the camera.<br><br>So... a 55mm lens on a camera with an APS-C sensor, gives you aproximately 'normal' vision, without magnification. A lens that has 55-200mm can therefore show you the world at 1x magnification all the way through ~4x magnification (200/55). <br>18-55mm will be a wide-angle lens where you can't magnify, but you can zoom *out* about 3 times, allowing you to get additional information in the shot. <br>(The normal human eye wouldn't be able to see this from the same position. For example, at 18mm you could take a picture of the entire dashboard of your car sitting in the drivers seat, normally you would only see a portion of it)  A fish-eye lens is an extreme example of a wide-angle lens, where you have a field of view that's larger than 180 degrees, and you can literally look over both your own shoulders at the same time. You also get extreme deformation of the image, though.<br><br>If you want to be able to both zoom out AND zoom in, you'd need a lens like the 18-200mm ones. Most of the time those have worse image quality than the more dedicated lenses, but you have the benefit of not needing to switch lenses as frequently. Those kind of lenses are often referred to as 'vacation lenses' for the convenience... But again, they come at the price of reduced image quality.<br><br>in general, wide-angle lenses are good for indoor photography (it's much easier to get a larger group of people or an entire room into the viewfinder if you can zoom out further. They are also great for landscape photography, since it's easier to record a sense of scale and wideness.<br>Downside is that you typically get some barrel distortion at the lowest sizes, where straight lines start to curve.<br><br>The 55-200mm would be a telephoto lens, and they are good for wildlife photography, picking up details far away from you, and things like sports photography where there is fast movement and you can't get close to the subject.<br><br>If you want to see some samples of how the zoom lengths affect the image, check out this page: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_view" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_view</a><br><br>At the bottom, there are some sample images of the same scenes shot at different zoom levels. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
