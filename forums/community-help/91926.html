My biggest pet peeve was finding that a crack-pot or fly-by-night computer guy was called there first and:<br>A. Filled their head with whimsical fantasies of what a computer can/cannot do.<br>B. Half-arsed fixed their crap just to make more work for me to undo what they did and do it properly.<br><br>Now they are finally ok with paying me the dollar I'm worth to come in and do it right after they wasted a ton of time and money on said crack-pot/fly-by-night.  If they would have done just a small bit of research they would find that doing it right the first time (regardless of cost) would have saved them valuable time AND money in the long run.  But no, they had to hire Joe (the accountant's) second cousin BillyRay, who just happens to own a computer himself (oooooowheeeee) and thinks he might know his way around 4 Dell blades (running linux) with an attached 200 gig SAN (this was a while back heh).<br><br>What does this mean for you WERDNA?  TBH, you can do whatever you please.  But for the love of every hard working computer tech, experienced webmaster and any other properly trained professional, please don't be that crack-pot/fly-by-night (please, do it for me).<br><br>If you really think your qualified to fill the heads of the ignorant, by all means give it a shot.  Just remember that someday, some poor schmuck will have to deprogram them and give them knowledge that comes from many many years in the trenches.  I'd hate for your name to be brought up and you loose respect in a community that is usually small (most IT people know hundreds of the other IT people in the area, it comes from corporate outsourcing and us being forced to contract, some contracts lasting from a couple months to a couple years, we get to know a lot of other local IT people who are in the same boat).<br><br>Anywho,<br>Those who don't know how to turn a computer on (in this day in age) really don't want to know (unless they have no exposure to technology, like a 3rd world country or something, in which case I doubt they will be able to pay you).  If they don't have a blog, chances are they don't want/need one.  If they don't have a website (given the thousands of 'do-it-yourself' website generators out there you get when you pay for hosting which make it as simple as point and click) then I doubt they care.<br><br>As for you (I'm sorry, but it's going to be some harsh constructive criticism): Your website doesn't scream "I know what I'm doing in html/javascript/css".  The fact that it's hosted by Google sites isn't all that impressive (sure, you could be lacking the funds for proper hosting, in which case you could have just asked someone if they could park it for you.  Most of use have oodles of space and not really needing all of it.  At least you'd be on a dedicated domain as opposed to using a free service, which would up your credibility).  Your PingPong game requires 1gb or more of ram, yet only 70mb of hard drive space?  I'm assuming you guessed on the ram requirement?  Even with some crazy compression (assuming your decompressing images upon application execution), that's a hell of a ratio.  Lastly the fact that your just looking for a quick buck (as you said in the original post) kinda says your going to do anything for that buck, even if your not properly qualified or willing to give it the proper effort. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

They were a little corner location running classes on how to use Word, check your email, that kind of thing. Now admittedly I have no idea what kind of overhead they were running (the location itself probably cost a fair bit in rent) but this is the middle of Chicago so if there wasn't enough business for them in the middle of the third largest city in the US then that's probably a bad sign for you. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Basically, have a pre-set list of subjects that you are going to wade through with the person, hour by hour... Have this set as a full course and learn it off by heart... It's no good people giving you money then oh'ing and erm'ing through each hour... If you sound confident on what your saying, chances are they'll hang on to your every word.<br><br>Make sure its in plain english, and be prepared to explain things in depth without the jargon and be precise.<br><br>Dont hog their PC, let them use it, people only ever really learn by doing, so, the closest you want to be getting is by pointing with your finger to the monitor where they should be clicking/reading.<br><br>Maybe prepare a handbook for the end of the course that you give to each person that goes through everything you went through with them for future reference.<br><br>Basically, try to build your services as a product, with clear outlines of what you are going to do, in one respect, this may help you stop people tripping you up with questions that totally digress on what your doing.<br><br>Good luck! :)<br><br>Dabz <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I've since reconsidered and will stay in a few more years.  That move for me was too sketchy and I like the money too much.  If I still have the coding passion at that time, that's when I'll do it.
