The biggest difference is there is NO user file system. This means you can't put files on it. So... wtf? how do you use it then? Answer: you put files in apps... to programmers familiar with non Apple platforms this is silly, but it's an extension of the sandboxing system essentially. Apps can only access stuff inside their own little world, making it very very hard to something nasty (if anyone nasty gets through apple to begin with...) to run amuck on the system.<br><br>In practical terms you either have to push data into an app through an interface provided by the app (most file storage apps have an SMB or similar mode to let you copy files into them), through iTunes into the device librarys if the data is compatible with iTunes (pictures, music and properly formatted video), or via iTunes into the file area of apps that support this (check your applications tab in iTunes, at the bottom you will have access to the apps that support document access and you can add/remove files in them there). Once a document is in an application the application is responsible from then on... don't shove text into a movie player, or movies into a text editor and expect success... For movies VLC was (might still be but I don;t think so) on the app store and is fantastic, I'm sure there are some alternatives but I haven't had to look them up since I snagged VLC a while ago :0)<br><br>Regarding your data on the server, and not wanting to use itunes. you can tell itunes not to copy things into it's library, but rather leave them where they are. If you can mount your storage location over a network, etc. you can then add the content to iTunes (keeping it it place, just teaching iTunes where to find it over the network basically) and then sync from there. Poke the iTunes settings to get started.<br><br>The iPad is a jumped up iPod touch, which is itself and iPhone without the phone. Unless you want to jailbreak you have to play by the rules, and if you do jailbreak don't expect everything to work as intended (can't just shove music onto the device and expect it to be visible in the music player which is a curated database... it wasn't designed for that.) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
