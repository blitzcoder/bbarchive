The game pulls the assets from subdirectries. And it saves the savegame data to one of those as well. <br></div>Probably.  You should've been coding for this in the first place, though.  I'm sure someone here would be willing to help in porting if you can't afford a Mac Mini, though.<br><br><div class="quote"> Also, don't Macs have anything like a Start menu? <br></div>No, not really.  You've got Spotlight, which is what Vista ripped off with its searching thing in the Start Menu, though, and that usually works for opening any application you're looking for.  Otherwise you'd probably just open the Applications folder (either in Finder or as a grid/stack/list in the dock).<br><br><div class="quote"> I mean you can't just stick every app you download on the desktop. <br></div>You could if you wanted to, but usually you just drag them to your Applications folder and they get copied there.

If you've used Windows 7, it's pretty much the same as its taskbar.<br><br><div class="quote"> But if there are multiple places where an app could be installed, I assume like on the PC, app makers will want to offer the user the option to easily install links to the app in all those places. <br></div>Nope, bad idea.  I guarantee you Mac users wouldn't like that one bit.  You definitely do <i>not</i> want to put junk in random places.  Basically, you should never, ever mess with stuff that isn't part of your application.<br><br><div class="quote"> And what of readme files and the like? And webpage links? How do those get dealt with? <br></div>You'd put them in the disk image and the user can refer to the disk image for those, otherwise they'll probably never be put directly in a folder.  Unless your players need these things, and they probably don't, you shouldn't bother to include them.  At best they'll be ignored, at worst they'll be annoying.<br><br><div class="quote"> I guess no uninstaller is needed because the app is assumed to only write to its own directory, and there's no registry to get cluttered up? And there's no shared dll's or anything either? <br></div>Not usually.  I'm not sure what you'd use a registry for under Mac OS, and there's probably one somewhere in some form, but I've never seen it or dealt with it.  There are shared libraries, and if your game is using any, you'd want to include them in the application bundle (see documentation).<br><br>Basically, anything that the user does not need, you probably do not include.  Mac users tend to be sort of picky when it comes to whether or not something works the same way as everything else does under Mac OS.  It's worth keeping in mind that the 'user experience' is important.  That phrase gets thrown around a lot, but it seems to apply very well to Mac users from what I've seen. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Secondly, doing it the way I'm suggesting (which works, considering I've been testing all the code as I write it, and it's really stupidly simple code) means you don't have to modify all of the paths for something just to build under Mac OS, but rather you just put some code specific to Mac OS in your initialization routine prior to loading resources.<br><br><div class="quote"> Okay, that's kinda like how you're encouraged to do it on Vista... but if I want to, can I write to the Resoruces directory? <br></div>You could, but if your user deletes the app, obviously their saves are going to go with it.

In some cases, the startup path might be ~, it might in the app bundle, or it might be some arbitrary location that's relevant to a specific context.

I have a friend who only has a Mac and she wanted to try the game out.  That's the only reason I'm bohtering with it right now.  I simply don't have the time to install a bunch of compilers and do a bunch of debugging to make it work at the moment, if that is what I would need to do.<br><br>But as you pointed out, that's not really neccessary, on my end, because I wouldn't be the one compiling it.  BUT, I do still have to find someone who CAN compile it.  And I have to debug it if it doesn't work for some reason.  <br><br>And there could still be bugs, even if your piece of the code is flawless. :-)<br><br><br><div class="quote"> (Bear in mind that for any objection you post I will have a rebuttal for, and it will probably make you look bad.) <br></div><br><br>Hehe. :-)<br><br><br><div class="quote"> Friendly advice here.
