Unfortunately the function keys, F1/F2/F3... etc seem to want to do HP Laptop specific functions and do not work in regular windows programs as they should.<br><br>We have tried plugging in a separate keyboard and the problem is still there.<br><br>We have googled and come up with many options, none for that specific laptop though, including the following:<br><br>A bios change (F10 on boot and then set "Action Keys" to disable/enabled) - however the bios screen on the googled page looks completely different to the one we see and has no option for "Action Keys".<br><br>Pressing FN and Num Lock, FN and Shift Num Lock, - none of these seem to do anything despite many web pages suggesting they should enable/disable the function keys.<br><br>We've looked in the windows control panel...we can add languages to the keyboard, but there is nothing I can see so far that refers to function or other special keys.<br><br>It really should be quite simple you would think - we just want standard windows F1-F12 functionality in our programs but the HP laptop seems determined prevent us from finding a way....<br><br>Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's one of the reasons PCs can be dirt cheap.<br><br>The problem with the HP function keys sounds like what you get when Caps Lock or Num Lock gets turned on by accident. Keyboard behavior is the opposite of what you expect. <br><br>Is there an "Fn Lock" equivalent? That's what the "FN and Num Lock, FN and Shift Num Lock" advice sounds like. I've seen utilities that make it harder to change Num/Caps Lock, for people prone to hitting them by accident.
