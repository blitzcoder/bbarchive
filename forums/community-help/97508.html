I think it is about to be released soon... <br><br>It's a reading game, and I have been using a French database which is available on the web and contains a lot of words, which can be sorted in many different ways. So I've created a few lists of words using that big database, but the game isn't embedding the whole database at all, just small lists of very common words taken from it. I could have made those lists myself without using the database but it would have been much longer and more painful.<br><br>When I did so I unfortunately didn't bother reading the legal stuff... The database is released under the Gnu Public License and I'm beginning to wonder which parts of my game are supposed to be released under the same license (the text files? the whole game? nothing?)... <br><br>I hope some people used to those kind of licenses can help me doing things right without stealing from anyone... <br><br>Thanks in advance, <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Are you extracting the words at runtime or have you pre-built word list files of your own in advance?<br><br>2) How are you packaging those files with your application? IncBin, or leaving them off to one side?<br><br>If you've made your own word lists by interacting with the database in advance, and they aren't compiled into the main body of your program, it's probably not violating the GPL in any way (I can't see how it would even come into effect).<br><br>Depending on the nature of the database and what you're doing to it, the word lists might count as derivative works, or more likely they might just be output (?). If the latter, then there's already no problem. Assuming the former, because it's more dangerous, the word lists themselves might also be covered by the GPL, but as long as your program loads and reads them as files, the program isn't being "linked" to them, it's merely reading data files that happen to be GPL (in the same way that MS Visual Studio can compile GPL'd C code if you want).<br><br>I very much doubt that individual words <i>taken</i> from the word lists can be considered GPL, as they've probably been deconstructed past the point of copyright by then. (You can't copyright a single word.)<br><br>Your best option is definitely to contact the owner of the database, ask them why they thought GPL was a good choice, and how you're supposed to interact with the gathered data.<br><br>However, if you can't do that... there probably isn't a problem here. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

(like i describe above) i would not touch  GPL interface code or libs with a bargepole.<br><br>However the OP should NOT be put off using it simply because the database itself carries a GPL licence and LGPL libs are fine to use with Blitzmax as long as the rules are followed.<br><br>Most GPL databases have a whole load of free and very permissive code interfaces.

I asked for 500 frequent words beginning with b without containing p, things like that, then I added articles, etc.).  <br><br>Then the user can load those word lists as data in the game to read them, among many options. <br><br>The whole code I'm using was written by me alone and there is no interaction at all with the database.
