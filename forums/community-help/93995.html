After 25 years as a Mac-only fan and a decade as a small Mac game developer, Apple finally wore me out with all their frequent surprises and arbitrary, changing rules.<br><br>Several years back, I got BlitzMax with the idea of cross-platform games.  Anyway, I've changed my priorities to Windows-first!  Bought a mid-range Win7 PC (AMD) which runs BlitzMax very well -- and cost &lt; half of the entry iMac.  While cross-platform is wonderful for independent developers, I've had trouble getting the last 2% finished.  <br><br>My current plan is to offer game(s) for Windows only -- no Mac and no Linux.  However, I have a few hundred customers of the older (deprecated by Apple) Mac versions.  I was looking for an inexpensive and easy way to bring these old customers along in the future, without asking them to buy a retail copy of Windows.  Apple itself has suggested running Windows games on newer Macs.  That's my story.  Keeping an eye on Monkey/Mojo... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Windows popularity is shrinking a little, but then again, if the current shrink actually lasts it'll be years before alternative systems a really big.<br><br>When it comes to running Windows software on Mac, Apple did hope that WinE would be ported to MacOS, but that never happened, and since Apple has no authority over the WinE group they cannot make it happen unless they would distribute it themselves. CrossOver is a plain disaster I would most certainly NOT recommend VirtualBox for the aim of gaming. VirtualBox is ideal for some (small) Windows utilities that you would not be able to run in MacOS X, but games do work well there and if they do they run very slowly. A lot of games I tried don't even work at all. When it comes to that all you can do to run Windows Software perfectly is to make a dual boot by programs like BOOTCAMP. <br><br>If you have a customer line in MacOS, you cannot expect them to switch to Windows, furthermore to make Windows run in either VirtualBox or BOOTCAMP you do need a Windows lisence (though I expect a lot of Mac Users got an illegal copy). If you want to set your aim on Windows-Only, I deem it more likely you'll lose those customers unless they are willing to go for the BOOTCAMP method (I heard that Parralels is also great for dual systems, but I never run that), which is expensive if you want to do it the legal since you need a Windows license.<br><br>Cut short, when you want to do it legal, I see no cheap/free RELIABLE way to get Windows games run on a MAC. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Sure your prior customers know you and your work, but the Mac market is in the middle of a big change.  With the App Store now being for OS X, this will become the main distribution method for OS X software.  If your stuff isn't in there, you will be fighting a losing battle to keep sales going to Mac users who are unwilling to use deprecated sales and distribution methods.  Since Windows software would never be allowed in the App Store, it would never be an option for you anyway and you would have a harder time getting Mac users to use your Windows based software.<br><br>Embrace the change to Windows if that is what you think is best for you (only you know that).  Keep in mind that many average Mac home users will be running Windows via Bootcamp or they will have a Windows system in the home.<br><br>For old customers that you want to be able to use your Windows only games, provide a section on your site that links to tutorials on installing Wine &amp; Wine Bottler on OS X and provide the link to Wine Bottler.<br><br><br><div class="quote"> Cut short, when you want to do it legal, I see no cheap/free RELIABLE way to get Windows games run on a MAC. <br></div>Wine works great.  Very reliable, free and open source.  It just isn't idiot proof and hasn't been dumbed down for the average Mac home user, which is why it is unpopular.  Wine Bottler for OS X does a very good job of dumbing it down enough so the average Mac home user should have no problem if they follow some of the video tutorials.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
