Looks like it might be related to Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Reference/CoreImageFilterReference/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/filter/ci/CIToneCurve" target="_blank">CIToneCurve</a> or <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/GraphicsImaging/Reference/CoreImageFilterReference/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/filter/ci/CIColorMap" target="_blank">CIColorMap</a>, but I don't really understand the difference between those or what they actually do based on that documentation.<br><br><br>The second effect I want to steal can also be accomplished using the GIMP's "Curves" tool. This time, leaving the graph pointing in the same direction but clamping its range:<br><br><img src="http://img831.imageshack.us/img831/9927/bruce2.png"><br><br>This is similar to "thresholding", but as far as I can tell "thresholding" means splitting the image into strictly either black or white pixels: what I want is to retain some shades of grey so that there is a smooth edge to the black and white areas rather than rough pixels (I've done a terrible job on the image above but it does show the existence of grey).<br><br>The particular reason I want this is to achieve something similar to the level transitions in <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/606382" target="_blank">Incredipede</a> (and probably many other games but this is the first one that comes to mind), where by shifting the graph rapidly to the left or right the image can "melt" smoothly into a black or white mass, or smoothly "dissolve" elements over a background:<br><br><img src="http://img831.imageshack.us/img831/5836/59229436.png"><br><br>(this is closer to what I actually want to achieve.)<br><br><br>Overall what I want to create is a flowing, liquid effect not entirely unlike <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJAoAc4syB0" target="_blank">the ink shadows in the game Okami</a>. My thinking is that these two techniques might go a long way towards creating that, e.g. by applying the not-thresholding to a regular hardware-lit scene to glob the shadows into inky chunks. Unfortunately, I don't know what they're called (I know nothing useful about effects in general) and therefore don't know how to begin researching this sort of thing, or how to implement it in real time (I can think of a couple of fixed-function ways, but I imagine that's terrible). Or for that matter if the <i>real</i> desired technique is actually well-known and there's a completely different standard way of going about it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You could create a very smooth "magic ink" dissolve or appearance effect, which would be much more interesting than a standard fade out/in.<br><br>What I think okami actually does in a number of places if offset elements and then shrink them with staggered timing so that there's overlap but since they're all shrinking, just with a different start time, they seem to "slurp" up to the end point. It works well for a trail or similar, but for a full picture in/out I think you're better off following the shifting route you're looking at here, since it would require breaking the image up in to lots of different points and managing them all which would be unreasonable and not look as good. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I think you can call these color-mapping or gamma-shifting.<br><br>You'll need to write pixel shaders for these to work, but it shouldn't be too hard.<br><br>That Incredipede transition seems to work from brightest to darkest pixels. You can work this out with a pixel shader and some "threshold" functionality: compute the average "brightness" of the pixel and see if it fails the threshold. Then you set its alpha to zero so it's transparent when you render the image with Alpha Blending enabled.<br><br><pre class=code>
// Pseudo.

/* Consider your threshold a value that goes from 1.0 (fully opaque) to 0.0 (transparent).
If the threshold is set at 0.0, your entire image is transparent. */

//RGBA color values in pixel shaders generally range from 0.0 to 1.0, instead of 255.
vec4 sampledPixel = texture(originalTexture, DataIn.texCoord)
float averageBrightness = (sampledPixel.r + sampledPixel.g + sampledPixel.b) / 3.0 //Cheap average - it doesn't take into consideration the color "sensitivity" weights of 0.2989, 0.5870, 0.1140, for R,G,B respectively.

//Test the brightness against the threshold. Look for documentation on Normalize and Clamp.
float alphaResult = normalize( clamp(threshold - averageBrightness, 0.0, 1.0) )

//Now alphaResult should hold either 0.0 or 1.0 depending if the pixel brightness passed the threshold.

//Pass the original pixel color, but use the computed alpha.
