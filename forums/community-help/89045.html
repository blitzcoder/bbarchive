Seeing as damage does not necessarily need to be an analogue dial, why not incorporate a vertical 'hydraulic fluid' bar which will loose fluid as the damage increases?

The game already has a particle system so clouds of black smoke from the exhausts would look visually cool and obvious to the player that the car is getting damaged.<br><br><div class="quote"> Only other thing I can think of is giving a visual cue with the nitro's flame when you're running low, perhaps have it change color, or fade more. <br></div><br><div class="quote"> make the flames fade/flicker/change colour according to how powerful they are, ie. how much nitro there is <br></div><br>Well the flames do change colour already - they turn purple and get larger (fnar!) as you use the nitro, but unlike the original Stunt Car Racer the flames are present all the time when driving, they're just smaller and yellow when not using the nitro. I like the idea of using smoke for the damage though so the exhaust flames could pop and bang and mis-fire when the car is damaged.<br><br>The nitro-boost in my game is used much less than the original Stunt Car Racer - the cars can slide around and be drifted and the effect of the nitro on the torque to the rear wheels is pretty vicious, so you have to be really careful using the nitro on anything other than a straight piece of track. Cornering fast is much more technical - you have to balance the power and slide the car around on opposite-lock, being careful not to oversteer and spin or understeer and fly off the track.<br><br>You can't just keep your finger on the boost button for the whole race as you did in the original Stunt Car Racer, where the car was glued to the track around the corners.<br><br>For those reasons I chose to have the exhaust flames present all the time (but smaller when not boosting) and the nitro limit is going to be pretty small, maybe just 10 seconds or so. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
