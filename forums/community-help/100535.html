Test programs get slower and slower the more times they run, eventually reaching up to 300% slower than the first run despite no changes in the code. And if the order in which I run programs is going to affect how fast they are, I have no hope of ever knowing what effect my changes have on a piece of code! The problem kicks in after several seconds, which can require up to 20 repeated runs of a simple test program, but it always happens eventually.<br><br>CPU frequency scaling is disabled; no user programs running in the background; Task Manager / top report 0% background CPU usage; same problem across Windows, Ubuntu, Lua, and C; across different process priorities (including realtime); tried timing with time (the program), time.h, QueryPerformanceCounter (on Windows) and rdtsc: all show the same slowdown curve.<br><br>At this point I'm assuming it's something to do with my PC being old and crap, but I really want to know why it's happening and how to work around it if at all possible. "Try using another machine" is certainly in my plans if necessary though. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I can't remember...), and while it still serves me very well for regular use, I'm starting to wonder if this problem is perhaps something to do with e.g. thermal paste degrading on the inside and meaning it's incapable of operating at 100% performance any more...?
