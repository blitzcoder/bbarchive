But with a 29.5 fps the TV has to interpolate 20.5 frames which isn't an even number, so it will be 2 frames sometimes and 1 frames about 20% of the time, which will cause it to look a little choppy.  Correct?<br><br>I am no expert, it is just my understanding of it, I may be off base here.<br><br>What I do know, is I bought a 240Hz TV a few months back.  And it smooths out those missing frames.
