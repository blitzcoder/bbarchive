I heard that the further you go with a branch, the more likely it will be that there'll be conflicts when you merge it back into the trunk.  This doesn't concern me a lot as I'm fairly sure the branch will never be merged back anyway - it will just reach a point where it stops.<br><br>Can I work on the branch copy and the trunk copy at the same time?<br><br>I really don't know what I'm doing with this stuff and I don't know if I'd be better off just cloning the entire repository to a new location, and checking it all out again to modify for a trial version.<br><br>Any thoughts?

Core - Trunk
     - Branches
Vars
     - Base Distribution
          - Trunk
          - Branches
     - Full Version
          - Trunk
          - Branches
     - Demo Version
          - Trunk
          - Branches
</pre><br><br>To set this up from an existing repo:<br><br>You would create all the core code for your app in one area (Core - Trunk), and all the variable items in the vars.<br><br>Vars - Base Distribution would be branched from the core initially and then NEVER merged down again.  <br><br>Once done, you remove all variable items from the core.<br><br>Then you remove all things core from the base vars.<br><br>Then you can branch the base distro to both the full and demo version sections.<br><br>Once it's set up, all you do is edit core code in the core area, edit global items that CAN vary in the base distribution (and merge up once ready), and develop distribution specific overrides in the specific distros.<br><br>You never merge down from a version dtribution, if something needs to go in both items, test it in the base distribution then merge up.<br><br><br>It can mess with your head if you have a lot of distributions, but not nearly as much as not having this set up.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
