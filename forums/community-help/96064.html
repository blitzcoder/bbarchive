I only expect a moderately amount of fans to want to buy merchandise to support my games and very few people being interested in buying the source code.<br><br>That being said, simple games like these do have a tendency to take off in popularity if they are fun and not buggy. Should there be a big amount of support I am definitely going to donate some money to a charitable organization called Healing the Children. This is a non-profit group that brings children from all over the world to the US, finds them host families and gets them medical care. My family was a host family for this group until we decided to adopt 2 of the kids we took care of (now we just take care of them ourselves and no longer take anymore kids but still go to conventions and stuff). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Someone asked if any of it would go to charity and I answered their question.<br><br>And how is this a "make my game for me!" thread? This is a job posting with specific requirements and discussable pay rate. Do you go around to freelance sites, pose as a programmer looking for a job, then find every game project and laugh at their attempt to "exploit" people?<br><br>If you knew my real name you would see that my family is actually a very big part of the organization I said I would donate too should this project get better support than I, or anyone else, would expect it too. My parents are on their "care council", have had 4 appearances in our cities news paper, and many other publications.<br><br>So I guess I will take this job locally to colleges like I was originally going to. Already had some interest there anyway. I just figured I would see what kind of talent I could find online plus have it written in BM, a language easier for new programmers to get results in (open BM code would be a better learning tool than open C++)<br><br>So if this is the attitude I will get on here then I'll just forget about it. I got 2 e-mails from people wanting to do the job but they wanted too much (one guy said $10,000 a month). Doing it myself is not an option. I am taking 16 credit hours of college plus working 30 hours a week. Sorry that I had to ask for a team. Didn't mean to "exploit" anyone.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
