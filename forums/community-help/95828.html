VirtualBox is also free, and I would say better than the free version of VMware.<br><br>Dual booting is the best option in my opinion, because you *have* to learn once you've fired it up. Can't escape back to Windows if things get confusing. Dual booting is very easy to set up - with a modern Linux installer it's no harder than a regular install (e.g. Ubuntu will automatically detect Windows and offer to do the hard work of setting up partitions automatically).<br><br>There's also Wubi, which installs Ubuntu and possibly other kinds of Linux to a loop-mounted device (i.e. a file) on your Windows disk, which has the advantage of being able to be removed in Add/Remove Programs when you get bored, but it's also slower and not officially considered reliable or stable. Advise against, as dual-booting for real is so easy (and since you pretty much know you're going to keep it, in this case).<br><br><a href="http://writers.fultus.com/garrels/ebooks/Machtelt_Garrels_Introduction_to_Linux_3nd_Ed.pdf" target="_blank">Machtelt Garrels' <i>Introduction to Linux</i></a> is nice and easy introductory reading for a quick overview.<br><br>Note that there's quite a lot of difference between the Linuxes available. Ubuntu is the most popular with beginners, but you might find something like CentOS more appropriate for "serious" use (actually I have no idea how true this is). At any rate it will give you experience with a commonly used business OS. (The mighty Wiki says it's the most popular for web servers.)<br><br>The biggest thing though, is to not be afraid to get your hands dirty. Use the terminal for <i>everything</i>, at least at the beginning (there are many graphical environments - you don't need to get confused by their trivialities). Run "man" on every command. Try things and see what they do.<br><br>...then get programming some C, Java, and anything else you intend to use, at the first opportunity! (C is <i>the</i> language to know on *nix systems, but Java and Python, and to a lesser extent various flavours of Lisp, are also important.)<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
