In the scan-reports details they usually write this (eg. "UPX-Packed" or "Molebox-Packed"). This may however be some sort of inconsequence: while they detect it as Molebox, they also detect a known signature from a virus definition file, but the virus signature detection has a higher priority, or the packing detection is ignored when the file is rated.<br><br>Funny, one scanner says the file is "suspect".

Please note it says "Unique packaging template" not "Unique packing template".

You should try it (naturally, the unique packaging template is only available to registered users).  We use it (and the SDK) at work for deployments. <br><br>It is not really fair to throw MoleBox in with EXE packers or EXE compressors since it is neither.
