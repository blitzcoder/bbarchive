Sometimes the web page doesnt even recognise me clicking the mouse to reload my inbox ( or any folder come to think of it ), but then it decides that it will detect the mouse clicks. When I compose an email I click the 'Send' button and the whole email just vanishes - not in the Sent Items, not in the Drafts, not in any other folder - just vanished.<br><br>As usual everything was working fine until they 'made' you use their latest website look.<br><br>Actually, can anyone recommend a better email service thats reliable please...<br><br>Cheers all <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Outlook.com is being advertised on TV, saying they don't scan emails like gmail does. Does anyone use outlook.com and is it a serious rival to gmail?<br><br>I'm not too bothered about my gmail being scanned as I don't use it for personal stuff.

No previous emails were kept during the upgrade. I don't know if he was fore warned or not if everything would be lost but it was.

I upgraded my mobile phone insisting that I keep the exact same contract and conditions. I'd never heard of tethering until the time I attempted to log on with my laptop, which failed and a phone call later it was explained, which was NEVER explained to me before, so in fact the contract was different, no point trying to argue with them, their attitude was 'if you don't like then leave it oh and you need to pay the rest of the contract if you opt out early'. I can understand them not wanting people to abuse the networks with downloading large files all day and night but then why are they advertising and selling an unlimited data usage package if they don't want people to use it - bizarre.<br><br>oh dear oh dear indeed :p <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
