It's about £500 and it has 4k resolution, four HDMI 2.0's, Samsung's smart hub is really nice, their game mode makes their TVs by far the best for gaming and at 48" it's about the right size for me.<br><br>I'm just looking at the new Samsung UE49KS7000. This matches all of the features of the cheaper set but also adds UHD Premium certification. So it uses Samsung's new Quantum Dots, has 10bit color, HDR, etc. The input lag is possibly slightly lower than the cheaper model too, but most of Samsung's TVs have very low lag anyway. That cannot possibly be worth another £800 though, can it?<br><br>Is HDR that good or just another gimmick that no one will care about the TV manufacturers will be ripping out of their TVs in a couple of years like they already are with 3D? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

On mine, the RJ45 is only 100Mbit, which is not enough for smooth 4K network streaming, unless pretty compressed that is. I have a gig router, so this was quite frustrating.<br><br>There should be more options for dealing with smoothing of fast moving images in the TVs menu. Frustratingly, this is present on their higher end TVs. I installed a hacked BIOS that enabled them back onto my TV and they worked fine. I have since removed the BIOS to use built in BIOS updater, which although it removed the menu options, puts the TV back into auto update mode.<br><br>A 2.0 BluRay should not have any problem. It has an USB 3, this is the simplest option to stream from files via a decent external drive.<br><br>4K TVs are fantastic to look at but unless you have the eyesight of a hawk, you loose the definition at over about two meters(A bed length if you have it in your bedroom).<br><br>Gaming is something else, 4K makes 3D vistas lush with detail but you need at decent rig to get 60hz and HDMI 2.0 outputs. There is no display ports but I've heard good things about this dongle... https://www.amazon.co.uk/CLUB3D-Displayport-4K60Hz-Active-Adapter/dp/B017BQ8I54/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1464046460&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=displayport+to+hdmi+2+0 It a sneaky way to get at a feature that is only supported on the more expensive models.<br><br>The 'smart' part of the TV behaves like a big tablet, with the controller acting as a pointer. It's quite good and you can install quite a lot of apps NetFlix etc. But don't expect opensource stuff like KODI/XBMP etc. There is Plex though. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I definitely hadn't considered the RJ45 issue that you pointed out and that's definitely worth checking out. Not much point having a 4k TV if it can't smoothly stream 4k from Amazon and Netflix. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The KS7000 was disappointing. Even on the test footage, it had huge color banding. Motion processing was very nice and the colors were excellent. The KS8000 was much better on the color banding front, no issues at all there. It looked like a really top notch TV.<br><br>Then I came home and ordered the UE48JU6400K for £500. As lovely as the KS8000 is, I just couldn't justify spending three times the price on it. Plus, the KS8000 has no headphone jack. So you either need an audio amplifier or a new pair of bluetooth headphones if you want to use headphones with it. The JU6400K arrives on Saturday. If the image quality is massively inferior to the KS8000, I can just sent it back for a refund and get the KS8000 but I doubt I'll be able to see what the extra £1000 was buying me.<br><br>Thanks for the advice. I do think the HDR TVs do an excellent job of upscaling the color as well as the image. Samsung seem to be better at upscaling than most other manufacturers so YMMV there. Ultimately, it just came back to price and £1000 is a lot for better colors and contrast. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The difference between this and the UHD Premium set for three times the price is very small.<br><br>Just one problem so far. Maybe you can help, Ian, since you appear to have a similar model. I've plugged a USB3 hdd in on the HDD USB slot. The drive itself is powered through a power supply so the USB cable is only being used for data. The TV doesn't say or do anything. Do I have to do something to set it up or is it just there when I want it? I was expecting some kind of plug and play alert asking me to set it up for use with the TV? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
