Giving the computer a rest and looking again saw it climb from 60-80 in a matter of minutes. I was happy watching YouTube vids and this is very rude and inconsiderate :(<br><br>Sooo... questions regarding old CPUs! Is it more likely that the CPU is burning up because it's on its way out, or is it more likely that the thermal paste boiled up and evaporated or something? The fan itself is still running at its regular pace (some 1900RPM).<br><br>Obviously I need to go to MSY and pick up something to replace something tomorrow. Hopefully a third party cooling solution would be the answer, but thought I'd check to make sure it isn't likely to be the CPU, in case anyone here knows anything about something. And things. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I've run many open case franken-puters, give it an extra blow through with some canned air, you never know where you might have a dust bunny (under the motherboard for example...).

With a closed case therer is a continuous flow of air from the front of the case to the back that passes across those chips as well. With the case open, who knows where the air gets pulled to/from.<br><br>Anyway, since you say that the fan itself is running properly at a decent RPM, I'd guess thermal paste could be the issue as well. If you re-do this though, be careful not to over-apply it: You just need a <i>tiny</i> bit to fill in the microscopic gaps in the metal, don't slab it all over the place because that can make things even worse.<br><br>Another potential issue could be the voltage running across the CPU: If your power supply is starting to go wonky, or capacitors on your motherboard are on their way out, it's possible that the voltage supplied to the processor is higher than it should be, leading to increased temperatures. Depending on your motherboard, you may be able to see current CPU voltages in the BIOS, or alternatively you can use a 3rd party program like CPU-Z to show the info in real-time from within windows. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Especially with a custom rig you might find your fans are in the wrong place, or not strong enough, or blowing in the wrong direction to get good air flow... I had one case that I loved but the design was utter trash, the air flow was crippled horribly so I had to run it open, on it's side so head could vent up, then mount a fan to the outside of the case to get flow under the mobo to keep things in back from getting too hot... generally the expensive of a case comes in 2 forms: materials (cheap plastic, vs. nice quality aluminum etc.) and engineering (is it a box with some screw holes in the right place for an ATX board, or did someone actually think where the wires are likely to run that might restrict airflow etc.)<br><br>But, to backup what xlsior said, the other components (that don't have their own thermal sensors...) need consideration too, especially if you're getting weird crashing, graphical artifacting etc. that could be a result of something getting toasty that shouldn't.<br><br>Side bar: my favorite case is the Mac Pro specifically because it's designed for air flow first and foremost. The components are split into sections and each section has an inlet and outlet fan to blow and pull air over them as needed. The processors even mount on a daughterboard at the base of the case so heat naturally flows up rather than across them (vs. traditional board mounting with a vertical arrangement), and their fins are mounted to maximize airflow over the heat pipes. The case itself is the ducting so there's no little pockets for air to gather. The whole front and back are milled grates to protect the internals while putting almost no air resistance in place... and of course the whole thing being made out of aluminum means that the case itself acts as a heat sink... it's huge and expensive as hell, but by god it works :0) compare to the cheapo cases I usually buy for custom clunker PC's and it's a wonder they don't burst into flames... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
