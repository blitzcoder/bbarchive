To prevent unauthorized use you can check them against and online database you're hosting and make sure that the # of installs is &lt; your maximum allowed<br><br>2) Lock the game against the user hardware<br><br>Now, both of these have massive drawbacks as well: #1 would require internet access, you always end up with people that have a valid reason to reinstall &gt; allowed times, leading to (rightfully) annoyed users and support issues<br><br>#2 would crap all over itself if the user upgrades to a new computer, or replaces whatever parts you are checking against. Obviously, people get annoyed if they buy a new video card and all of a sudden the game they bought stops working, or if they upgrade to a new computer and can't take their program with them.<br><br>Unless you have a good support mechanism in place to handle the inevitable problems in short notice and are very, <i>very</i> careful that you know what you're doing, I strongly recommend against going overboard in this area...<br><br>there are special 3rd party wrappers available that can protect a game including the entire serial number validation and such, but there really isn't a single 'perfect' solution: One way or another, it's likely to be a hindrence to some of your legit customers sooner or later. (And in the end: <i>those people are your customers</i>, the pirates aren't)<br><br>Do know this: ANY software protection WILL be broken if the game is interesting enough. It may take a little time, but nothing holds forever. You need to make sure that the walls you put up aren't to intrusive to legitimate users, or many may forgo the game altogether.<br>(Case in point: There was a huge stink about Spore's DRM when it was released. Many, many people didn't end up buying it because of that. At the end of the day the big question is still whether or not the DRM helped the company due to reduced copying more or less than that the customers they lost by implementing DRM in the first place.<br>be careful not to make the genuine product significantly less appealing than the cracked version. :-? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Keep your computer locked down so that no one can access it when you're not there.<br><br>Or just accept that people will copy it, and spend the time you could have spent trying to stop them making the game better so that more of the people who won't copy it will buy it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That will at least stop somebody who has bought the software from passing it around to anybody that wants it.<br><br>But you'll never prevent DRM from being cracked so don't give yourself an ulcer over it when it inevitably happens.<br><br>Another tip is to upload fake torrents that are the equivalent size of your game, but don't work after download, or are a file full of random crap, or only download as far as 98% etc.  The only abuse you'll get from this, will be from warezers who insist that you are robbing them of their 'freedoms' and 'privacy'. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
