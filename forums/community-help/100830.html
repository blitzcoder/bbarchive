EXT. HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT BUILDING – MORNING

               The Chevy Nova PROPELS itself into traffic.

               INT. NOVA (MOVING) – MORNING

               Jules is behind the wheel,Vincent in the passenger seat and 
               Marvin in the back.

                                     VINCENT
                         ...Ever seen that show "COPS?"  I 
                         was watchin' it once and this cop 
                         was on it who was talkin' about this 
                         time he got into this gun fight with 
                         a guy in a hallway. He unloads on 
                         this guy and he doesn't hit anything. 
                         And these guys were in a hallway. 
                         It's a freak, but it happens.

                                     JULES
                         If you wanna play blind man, then go 
                         walk with a Shepherd. But me, my 
                         eyes are wide fuckin' open.

Snip

               Vincent turns to the backseat with the .45 casually in his 
               grip.

                                     VINCENT
                         Marvin, what do you make of all this?

                                     MARVIN
                         I don't even have an opinion.

                                     VINCENT
                         C'mon, Marvin. Do you think God came 
                         down from Heaven and stopped the 
                         bullets?

               Vincent's .45 goes BANG!

               Marvin is hit in the upper chest, below the throat. He GURGLES 
               blood and SHAKES.

                                     JULES
                         What the fuck's happening?

                                     VINCENT
                         I just accidentally shot Marvin in 
                         the throat.

                                     JULES
                         Why the fuck did you do that?

                                     VINCENT
                         I didn't mean to do it. I said it 
                         was an accident.

                                     JULES
                         I've seen a lot of crazy-ass shit in 
                         my time –

                                     VINCENT
                         – chill out, man, it was an accident, 
                         okay? You hit a bump or somethin' 
                         and the gun went off.

                                     JULES
                         The car didn't hit no motherfuckin' 
                         bump!
</pre><br><br>I trimmed a lot of the dialogue out, but it wasn't need, I also didn't have to trim out the alternate where marvin is still alive and is shot a second time (which results in the exterior shot blood splat).<br><br>But as a script, you can see little in way of set dressing bar the initial few establishing lines.<br>The scene plays out in a car, not much more to say.<br>If how ever I looked for a novelisation of the film, that scene could be padded out with more description, but also as it is heavy on the dialogue it would just end up nothing but lines of<br>"Moo"<br>"Baa"<br>alternating between the two, but as there isn't a third voice till Marvin is asked a question, you don't need to establish which is Jules and which Vincent after the initial few lines.<br><br>You can spice it up with "Moo!" Vincent yelled etc, but if the reader knows it's Vincent's line we don't need the word yell all the time when ! is in the quotes. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

(Writing wasn't my strong point in school.)<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>A small group of passengers arrives on an uncharted beach, and shortly after they are attacked by robbers.<br>Among those travelers, a woman carries her newborn in her arms.<br>As she witnesses her friends being slaughtered, she dashes inland to a nearby cave, carrying her child with her.<br>Inside the cave she encounters a chest.  She decides to hide her baby in it.   <br>As she exits the cave, the gang finds her,  and she is also killed.  <br>The child, now orphaned, starts to cry, but remains hidden in the cave.<br><br>Later, a large wolf finds its way towards the child, sneaking closer.  <br>Yet, this newborn has a unique destiny, and no harm shall come to him from any beast.<br>The female wolf starts to care for the child, first offering breast milk <br>and then treats of raw meat.<br><br>The years went by, and that baby has become a boy.   <br>The mother wolf, long past her days of caring for the boy, wanders away one day never to return.<br>The the boy is now alone.<br><br>Having become hungry and desperate, this feral child learns how to steal milk from a famer's cows in daring nocturnal raids.<br>But, the farmers notice the intrusion and one night, the boy is caught.<br><br>In a nearby village the people tried to domesticate this wild child,  but  there was no success.  <br>The kid remained aloof and wild for the rest of his life.<br><br>The child eventually grew to be old, and later died. <br>Even past the notice of his death, people tell of seeing some wild-child<br>by that cave.   To this very day, ancient stories prevail, are told and <br>retold in pubs and gatherings, of a wolf-child and the mysterious treasure chest guarded by him, <br>that anyone coming near his treasure chest shall be killed by him.<br><br>For hundreds of years, no one man has dared encounter and open that chest, and it would have remained so, but until recently, someone did....<br>--------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Well, that was kind of spooky. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Sounds perfect for a  voice from the off. Couple of things. no beaches in the alps, the baby won't be inside the chest, but being put into the cave just like the chest. After his death, he won't protect the chest, but his ghost will do so. Anyhow, nice style. Now  let's see if I can get James Earl Jones for the voice part... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
