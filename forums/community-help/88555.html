Using less than 4 beats of a song may not be theft. Back then it was especially important because everybody just began to sample, eg. the snaredrum of david bowie, mixed with the hihat of whoever. Or James Browns "ow!" for example.<br>Of course, if the sample contains remarkable parts of a composition (aka melody) then it's theft. Usually such a short sample (half a second or so) doesn't contain the characteristics of a composition. So if you create a new Song with a couple of samples and the new song has nothing to do with the sample material sources, they even cannot be identified by non-pros, then it might be hard to sue you. <br><br>Using Funky Town in the game is something diffrent. since you are making use of the explicit Song and its Populaity etc. it isn't legal, officially. Of course, they problably won't care as long as there ain't no millions floating around, as somebody already said. But you never know if there is a mean man somewhere, a competitior or so who's going to wake them up just to make you troubles.
