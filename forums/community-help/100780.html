There are much better solutions out there nowadays that can be had for the same amount or even for free.<br><br>Blitz3D is a product that dates back to the PS1/PS2 era (it's probably older than you are!), when 3D was a difficult and tedious thing, and it hasn't really aged very well and doesn't offer very much compared to 2013-era engines. Both the language and the 3D graphics system are very dated and limited compared to modern tools, and learning them will teach you a little bit... but it will also set you into some extremely obsolete habits and ways of thinking about 3D graphics that will take longer to un-learn (B3D is based on a kind of 3D technology that essentially no longer exists, but modern graphics cards are fast enough to emulate it in hardware so that older games still work).<br><br><br>To try to answer your individual questions:<br><br>-- B3D is a "higher level" (more abstract) command set than OpenGL (or DirectX, which is the one it uses; you could build it on either). Instead of directly building strips of triangles and throwing them at the GPU under different renderstates, you just put objects in a scene and move them around, and the engine takes care of the gritty details of how these actually get rendered.<br><br>-- To make simple shapes and move them around? Depends how fast you are, but between minutes and hours. You should grasp this in a single session if you study the tutorials carefully.<br><br>-- To make an actual shooter game? You should be prepared to spend weeks or months on this - <i>after</i> you've learned the ins-and-outs of the programming. Making an actual playable game involves a lot of time spent on things like creating artwork and testing that it plays properly. (An experienced B3D user could probably knock out an FPS where blank cubes jump around firing more cubes at each other in an afternoon, but who wants to play that?) Even something like Doom would take weeks of work on level design (if you want it to be any good), even though the programming would only take a couple of days.<br><br>-- The difficulty depends entirely on you. In my opinion, programming is easy but game design is very, very hard (as above, games are 90% stuff-other-than-programming, like models and animations and so on).<br><br>-- The language is actually the same as BlitzPlus, except that BlitzPlus's GUI commands are all gone and replaced with a bunch of 3D graphics commands. The 2D graphics part is actually the same between B3D and B+.<br><br>-- Networking: yep. Several good examples of that in the code archives, too.<br><br>-- B3D does not provide any particular collaboration tools, so collaboration is entirely a factor of what else you're using (use Git for version control: you won't regret it) and how well your team work together.<br><br>-- There are a lot of tutorials.<br><br>All that though... no, I don't think it would be money well spent at this time in history. B3D was an awesome purchase in the 2000-2004, but the world has moved on and it hasn't. You'd be stuck using archaic techniques, writing slow code for a slow engine, and unable to port to targets like iOS or Linux, or to fix compatibility problems with newer versions of Windows. Much as I love it and love working with it, I definitely couldn't say that it's a solid choice for a beginner any more, when nowadays there are far more powerful engines available for free.<br><br><br>If you can save up $200, an absolutely brilliant commercial engine for PC and Mac (and soon, Linux) is <a href="http://www.leadwerks.com" target="_blank">Leadwerks 3</a> (it's actually made by a B3D veteran!). It's insanely powerful, and uses modern rendering techniques of the sort that belong in triple-A mainstream games. Although the author's a bit of a C++ fan, you can also use it out-of-the-box with Lua, which is a nice friendly language a lot like a modernised and updated BASIC. In a lot of ways you could view Leadwerks+Lua as a B3D successor.<br><br>While there are a lot of powerful free engines out there that also beat B3D on rendering ability, I don't know of any that are easy to just set up and go the way B3D or Leadwerks is (to be honest, this is 90% of what you pay for). Many of them also require you to have at least a basic knowledge of C or C++ (at the very least you usually need to be able to patch in Lua yourself, so that you can stop doing anything further in C).<br><br>Finally, this is a bit of a gratuitous self-plug, but you can always check out <a href="https://github.com/Leushenko/bOGL-2" target="_blank">bOGL-2 for BlitzPlus</a>, which is a free BlitzPlus library that introduces a cut-down 3D engine similar to (but not the same as) Blitz3D. Might help you get a taste for 3D before you spend any money. (It's very slow and limited even compared to B3D, and doesn't have many comands, but it is usable. You could make something like Quake II in it no problem.) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's completely procedural by design, so if you decide to move on to something object-oriented later, you'll find you've spent a lot of time learning a language that you can't take very much from.<br><br>With that in mind I'd recommend Blitzmax.  It's a week's pocket money more expensive but well worth the difference, and you can still do 3D stuff with the MiniB3D module, which is free.

Not only that, but Monkey is more flexible in the way it works as the code it generates has to be compiled by a external compiler such as Visual Studio Express; this means with a little know-how (tweaking the compilers project files) you can compile applications in to 64bit binaries (as long as the 64bit build tools are installed), this is something that Blitz Max and Blitz 3D cannot do.<br><br>The demo version of Monkey only compiles code for HTML-5 and you need a computer with a bit of power and google chrome or it looks choppy.

Anyway as I remember the various games   wrote in javascript, I may try it nevertheless... ah wait, I would have to port it to monkey first...<br>how diffrent, compared to javascript is monkey at all, language-wise? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

On the whole yes there are loads of different languages or game engines out the but monkey is a good alternative to loads of them one big plus is it has a friendly community that is growing steadily but surely :)<br><br>unfortunately max is slowly getting lost by the wayside due to lack of advancement which is a shame as that is a language that i did like a lot :\ BRL has moved over to monkey now and the change shows by the masses of upgrades it gets and the roadmap plan for it :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Now let's get back to the initial topic.<br><br>I'd conclude as follows: Get yourself the free Demo of Blitz3D. About making FPS Shooters you should know that a lot of work goes into 3D modelling and animation, that usually is not done in Blitz3D, but in external tools, such as Blender, 3Dsmax, Maya and many more and which is a whole Science field by its own. You can spend decades in getting good in this. I did however code my first one level fps in two weeks, using some generic models. actually I had to remove it fr,m my site, but the second version is still online, csp fps engine demo 2, if you want to give it a try.<br><br>if you like blitzplus then you will love blitz3d. tho, no windows gui in blitz3d, you will have to use third party guis or brew your own one...something i always loved to do. also note the ongoing windows8 fullscreen compatibility discussion in blitz3d forum section. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
