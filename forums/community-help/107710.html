Not available in most "china smartphones"... Which is what most budget users have.<br>I also own such a vr-glasses thing (10 eur including mini-bluetooth-joypad) but totally forgot that none of our phones (Huawei ones) seems to have gyroscopes. Had to use a (non-low-level) windows phone of my father to test it out. But availability of working and "free" vr games in their store was very very limited. Played a zombie shooting game (target a unit log enough and autoshoot...). Was ok but phone res was too low so you saw the grid...<br><br>Bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I use a Radeon RX480 4GB graphics card myself, which so far has worked well for everything I've tried to run on it. &lt;$200<br><br>Personally I greatly prefer the room-scale VR stuff over the sitdown versions, because I have no motion sickness in roomscale, but feel like puking after 30 seconds of the sit-down games (disconnect between seeing movement while not actually moving physically is disorienting and nauseating. Of course, YMMV. I can't play typical FPS games on a normal monitor without getting sick either, but roomscale VR doesn't bother me at all.)<br><br>Vive includes room-scale sensors and controllers, but if you add the motion controllers to occulus then the cost is pretty much the same for both.<br><br>And FWIW, there's some 3rd party mods to add Vive VR support to existing games as well, e.g. Doom 3 Steam BFG edition: <a href="http://uploadvr.com/doom-3-bfg-vr-vive/" target="_blank">http://uploadvr.com/doom-3-bfg-vr-vive/</a><br>Don't know if there's any occulus mods.<br><br>/Got a Vive myself<br>//Pretty nice<br>///Games are a lot cheaper than for the PS4 VR <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
