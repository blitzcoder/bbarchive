Hopefully, I've got this all wrong, and some Android experts can set me right, but if half of this is true, I'll forget about Android for another couple of years at least.<br><br>So I'm trying to find a phone that is actually usable for moderate games, and I'm being told that basically anything pre-ARMv7 is worthless. Many of them don't even have VFP, and wouldn't even run a game I could run on my 2nd gen iPod Touch. And apparently this isn't just the cheap Android phones and the new Chinese cheapy tablets, this is HTC, Samsung, Sony, etc phones costing £200+. Essentially, I'm told that HTC Desire, Samsung Galaxy S, Motorola Droid, Dell Streak, Samsung Tab, and a couple of names I couldn't even find are just about the only phones capable of iPhone-level gaming.<br><br>Ok, so I'd better find one of those. Well forget the Galaxy S because the 2.1 firmware is completely broken on that, Samsung futzed up the memory paging and it randomly crashes when you run an app. The 2.2 firmware is either out or coming soon, but you have to use Kies, Samsung's proprietary patcher, and that has a basically 50/50 chance of working on any given PC. Dell Streak comes with Android 1.5 (!) and although there is a 2.1 update, Dell didn't actually update their firmware to fully support 2.1, so installing it wipes your ROM, deletes all your apps, removes half of the functionality (including the store) and may actually brick it altogether. Samsung Tab is over £500, and from reviews is very poor and less responsive than the Galaxy S even. So I'm pretty much left with the Desire or nothing. Ok, I'll get that.<br><br>Hmm, the Desire has a very small Rom size, but you can add SD Cards, right? So that's no problem. Oh wait, on this page, it says you can't put apps on your SD cards on any Android phone unless you root it. I thought it was only megalopolies like Apple who told you what you could do with YOUR phone. Guess not. Oh well, it's not like I need a ton of apps. Still, if I make a 100MB app, how are people going to have room to install it if they can't use the SD card. And then I stumble across the worst news of all. My 100MB app won't be a problem for anyone, because I won't be able to build a 100MB app. There is a 25MB limit on the app size, to stop people filling up their phones with apps too quickly. And despite promising in May to fix it, Google haven't, because the only way they can fix it is to let me install apps on my SD Card and they can't do that because they haven't figured out how to stop me pirating all my apps if I can put it on my SD Card.<br><br>So would someone with experience please tell me I have this all wrong and that cheap £100 android phones can play iPhone level games, that I can have 100MB apps on the Android Store, and that all the myriad of manufacturers using Android aren't so disorganized that most of the powerful phones are completely crippled by broken or incompatible firmware. I'd kinda like to be wrong on this. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
