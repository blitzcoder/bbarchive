I'm not sure of the details of its existing problems, but apparently it was something to do with missing Windows system files, which was preventing him from installing things, including the update packages that might have fixed it.<br><br>Anyway, the plan was for me to install XP Pro using my installer CD, which is a fully licensed, genuine-windows-holographically-printed disc. Tried and true, I've used it to install XP on my old PC, my laptop, and my new homemade desktop, all three of which went without a hitch. He also wanted to try Ubuntu, so I prepared an ISO Ubuntu Live CD, testing both the MD5 checksum and the CD itself after burning; all results confirmed 100% integrity.<br><br>SO, I start the XP install. To avoid complications (hah!) I was going to format his HD manually at first, using an XP MS-DOS floppy (his laptop has a floppy drive, w00t!) which I've also used on several occasions for just such a task. Trouble was, his laptop won't recognize the disk, nor will it recognize the Win98 floppy I also keep. Yes, I checked the boot device priority in the BIOS, and yes, the floppy &amp; CD drive are checked first. It just wouldn't acknowledge the presence of system files on either disk.<br><br>Okay, plan B: format the HD with the XP CD. So, in it goes. Everything starts fine, and I reach the main menu. It's a 20GB HD, (about 19.6 when you see it in Windows) so I made a 10GB partition for XP and left the remaining space unpartitioned for Ubuntu. Then, I started the format, with NTFS. It moved great to begin with, until it hit 54%, at which point it hung around for <i>ages</i>. It moved on eventually though, while I was out getting groceries. When I get back, the format has completed &amp; the transfer has begun, but there's a message on the screen saying that XP cannot copy such-and-such a file. Every time I hit Retry, it hit the same error, and when I tried to skip, the very next file had the same problem. the transfer had only made it to about 2%. <br><br>SO, I abort the transfer. Laptop reboots, CD loads, and BOOM, it says there's no hard drive present! Wha?! The BIOS confirms that the laptop is not recognizing the existence of its HD. After removing the drive for examination &amp; re-inserting it, however, the laptop finds it again &amp; I go back to the XP installation.<br><br>THIS time, I decide to format the whole thing with NTFS, one partition only. Maybe that's what messed it up. NOPE! It hangs at around 28% this time, and again at 66%, then when it's done, the transfer fails again, except this time it fails at a different file further on at about 3%, which seems to rule out the possibility of disc defect. Oh, and the HD disappears again; removing &amp; re-inserting it brings it back. Again.<br><br>SO, I figure, maybe Ubuntu can do what XP can't. Wrong again. The installation never starts; the screen gets left with a blinking cursor, which also disappears after a while, leaving the laptop blank and silent. Trying to run Ubuntu Live without installing brings the same result.<br><br>At this point, I'm out of ideas. My tentative diagnosis: Hard Drive malfunction. Am I wrong in this assumption? At this point, I'm honestly beyond the realms of my personal computer experience; out of my league. Any suggestions, anyone? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There is no such thing as a "specialised version".<br><br>If you install from a Windows CD, what you won't have, are all the laptop-specific hardware drivers.  These can usually be found on the manufacturer's website, and you'll need to install most if not all of them.  The upside to this is that you won't have all the factory-installed bloatware that laptop manufacturers insist on filling your hard drive up with - usually their own branding, Microsoft Publisher, and a cut-down and next to useless version of Encarta would be "the norm". <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
