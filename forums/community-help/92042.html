Now 'TalkTalk' owns tiscali and I was paying £15 for 1Mb unlimited. Now without notification they have bumped it up to £20 for 8Mb and 40Gb limit. (lines top speed is 3Mb).<br><br>No email saying they were doing it. Lucky I had money in my account!<br><br>What is going on? I pay BT phone line charges as well, so that brings it to over £30 a month. I could sign up to an 18 months contract with TalkTalk for £20 a month with line rental included.<br><br>What do you guys suggest?<br>Jim <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If your in a cable area why not sign up to a Virgin Media (Note: Richard Branson has nothing to do with VM apart that he has shares) deal broadband + phone and get rid of BT.<br><br>But my advice would be to shop around and find out what deals are on and defiantly find out what the customer service is like as well as any horror stories. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Before that deal is done, call again and if they say they won't extend the deal (most likely) tell them you are switching providers and seriously do if they don't give you a deal... because the new one probably will give you a deal.  Not sure about your area but we have two large providers (Shaw and Telus) and I just switch services back and forth and always have a bill &lt;$67/mo CAN for phone,internet, and tv. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I can guarantee you'll want to switch once you've been with TalkTalk for a few weeks. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
