It's great also, because it's a low impact exercise, as your knees aren't pounded so much.<br><br>As for building new muscle, you need to use low rep, high intensity workout. Going on a cross trainer will make your muscles fitter, and will be generally good for your bodies health. You don't need much equipment for building muscle to be honest. A couple of free weight will do the trick.<br><br>I must stress though, you must eat correctly, or it could have a negative impact on your overall muscle mass. Good amounts of protein, and carbs, will help give your muscles the energy, and the means to rebuild themselves. You should generally eat more good food, if you intend to exercise, as your body needs more calories/protein to maintain it's mass. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Cross trainers are pretty good (if often perceived as "girly" machines) for a cardio workout, good for people who are heavy (either muscle tissue or fat tissue), as they're more gentle on the knees than treadmills or cycles.<br><br><div class="quote"> I'm thinking of buying one, mainly to stay in shape, but I wonder if it is also capable to build up some new muscle. <br></div>No. If you want to have a greater muscle mass, you'll need weight training. Kettle bells are a pretty good all-around muscle building exercise, but failing that bar and dumb bells are reasonable alternatives.<br><br><div class="quote"> Do anyone of you use it and if so, are you satisfied of the results ? <br></div>I use it for warm-up, cardio and cool-down, mainly due to a recurring knee injury, which prevents me from running for any significant duration. But you need to spend a lot of time on it.<br><br><div class="quote"> Good amounts of protein, and carbs, will help give your muscles the energy, and the means to rebuild themselves. <br></div>You don't need carbs as an energy source for muscles. Only brain tissue needs carbs. Fat works well as muscle energy, if you have a high enough oxygen saturation to burn it (it takes 3 times as much oxygen to burn fat, as it does sugar and amino-acids). You also only need about 0.7 grams of protein per kilogram of muscle tissue you wish to maintain. You should also be careful about eating too many carbs, as any carbs not immediately burnt, is stored as saturated fatty acids (the bad kind) for later use. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Then between half an hour and an hour later, consume a small amount of processed sugars, followed by the right amount of protein.
