One of the tools the workers there have to use is a util I coded specifically for them in BlitzMax. This util works perfectly, so that's not the problem.<br><br>Fact is my util uses the internet and since it's a util that is not known by the Norton Firewall (due to the small group of people that has to use it I'd be surprised if it was), it gets blocked out. It's only one employee who has this and only when he works overtime at home this is a problem, but still.<br><br>Now I don't have Norton myself (due to my experiences with Norton I feel safer throwing a bucket of water over my computer than installing ANY Norton product on it), and the employee in case is a total nitwit when it comes to computers. I cannot visit him at his home to help him out. I know that Norton should have a feature that only lets my util through and keep blocking the rest out, but since I don't have Norton myself I don't know where that feature is and how to activate it.<br><br>Does somebody have Norton and if so, can you tell me where exactly those features are so I can help him solve this problem?<br><br>Just point me which actions this guy has to take. Remember I need to tell him without the ability to sort things out myself and this guy will most likely not understand when I only say "let this program through".... (If it were that easy the problem would already be solved). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Would he understand...<br><br>In Nortons main window there will be a settings button or link ( a text link ).<br>In the Settings window there should be either a button or link for the Firewall  settings.<br>In the Firewall settings window there will be a button or link 'Program Rules'.<br>Clicking that will bring up all the programs on the PC that Norton allows/disallows access in/out of the internet.<br>If your program has been stopped by Norton already then it will be in the list. Otherwise he can Add the program manually and set its access options.<br>There will be buttons in that window to Add/Remove/Modify programs access settings.<br>These access options are the 'Internet access' options - either Allow,Deny,Auto or Custom. Setting your Blitz Util to Allow will set Norton to allow it full access to the Internet. 'Remove' will only remove the access rules inside Norton, not remove the software, just in case he worries about that, and 'Custom' will allow you to select which ports the program is allowed to use. 'Deny' is ... well, i'll leave you to guess ;-)<br>I imagine your Util is set to 'Deny' or 'Auto'<br><br>Again this is just a general rule of thumb as far as Norton products go. They tend to follow the same pattern of windows/procedures/buttons, so it may not be the exact procedure or exact button wording etc.<br><br>Hope this helps.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It must be about 15 years at least since I last used a Norton product, so I hope you understand I don't know today's version at all. I also suspect that the version he has in in Dutch, and since the translators of those programs often do a HORRIBLE job (which one of the reasons why I always set my software to English, even though it's not my native language) I really hope I can get your explanation working in that version.<br><br>But most of all your story is written in a way that may help me explaining things to him. Another problem is that I never met the guy in person, I only heard to complaint through my employer with the request for me to solve it, so here I am. But I'll meet him soon as there will be a briefing shortly about my activities and how the other employees have to work with the stuff I make for them (oh, do I feel important), so I can pick up your story and take it with me in the briefing.<br><br>Thanks a lot for your time, Dave <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
