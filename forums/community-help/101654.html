I have been away making games in Java and JavaScript. But, I’m just looking to expand my horizons. Java is such a cool toolset to use and I’ve gotten so used to it. But, while I continue to use Java, I’m wondering what it will be like to expand and try to use C#. I personally like making web games. So thus, I was wondering can C# be used to make web games like Java can? And what are the benefits to learning C#? I'm also unclear as to why it was made. Thanks. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's a nicer version of the same thing, more or less. It has a few "advanced features" Java chose to leave out, but the basics are very similar indeed.<br><br><div class="quote"> I'm also unclear as to why it was made. <br></div><br>So is everyone else. (Politics, basically.) Strange choice that it may have been at the time, it does have a solid niche now though.<br><br><br>You really won't be stretching yourself with it though. Coming from Java you'll pick up the basics and be coding happily in it within the afternoon (it helps that since C# has more features, this is the easier way to go: you won't miss as many things as if you went C#-&gt;Java).<br><br>The advantage of learning C# is to open up another platform (the CLR), not really to learn anything language-wise. If you want to learn and expand your skillset in terms of actual languages, you would probably do better to stay with the JVM and simply pick a different language to use there. Clojure and Scala are both powerful, <i>very different</i> Java languages that will teach you all kinds of new and valuable things while staying on the platform you already know how to use. I recommend trying one of them. (Similarly, if you do eventually go to .NET, consider F# instead of C#. It's the hot new thing on that platform.)<br><br>I don't know how exactly you're using Java and the JVM anyway, but it doesn't sound like changing platforms would help much with what you want to do. .NET <i>can</i> do that sort of thing, but it's not especially good at or focused on it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
