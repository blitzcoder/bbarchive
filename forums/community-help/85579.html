That should already give you a pretty clear idea of what is and is not under copyright.  There are exceptions, of course, in which something may still not be copyrighted and the reason it hasn't appeared elsewhere is that it was taken from a more obscure source. <br><br>As for specific examples, you probably couldn't make a game featuring spells called fonic hymns or an ability called Overlord's Wrath (from Tales of the Abyss and Disgaea, respectively), but, in the case of abilities and spells, a name change and an alteration of the graphics associated with them would probably make them sufficiently different.  So many games feature similar spells and abilities already that no one would know the difference.  Stay away from anything that is too central to another game's (or book's, or movie's) plot, though, as those things are more likely to be noticeable.<br><br>Races get trickier.  The above question should answer what can and cannot be used in most cases, but there are some cases that are not quite so clear cut.  I would stick to those which you either come up with yourself or can be found in mythology or older texts whose copyright has expired (elves and dwarves being the classic, albeit slightly worn, examples). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If the source of the original race or class is not obvious, it may be worth investigating, if not for any other reason than to have a better understanding of what you're dealing with (which is always helpful when coming up with plot, characters, backstory, etc.).  Also, those races are probably inspired by mythology or older stories that have accompanying artwork and descriptions, and many of the classes that repeat themselves (such as fighter/warrior or wizard/mage) are not exactly original concepts. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The Warrior/Mage/Thief is simply a fantasy version of Rock/Paper/Scissors.<br><br>As far as races go, that's more or less the same deal. In a high fantasy setting, you might be able to get away with having a wookie race, if they in no manner resembled Chewbacca. Generally tho' I'd proably do my own thing, just to be on the safe side. Besides Tolkienesque high fantasy is boring. Do what Perturbatio suggests. Dwarves, Elves and Giants are pretty safe, because they're plagiarized from Norse Mythology anyway, and thus predates Tolkien and similar high fantasy authors by about a millennium. I'm also pretty sure you can't have a "Chaos" race without running into problems with Games Workshop.<br><br>For reference, Cyanide got sued by Games Workshop for Chaos League, because Games Workshop thought it was too similar to Blood Bowl (which it was, fair enough, but so was Brutal Sports Football). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Same as using "Sword", "Elysium", "Pandemonium", "Spellbook", "Wand Of Fire", "Strength" or "Hit Points" separately. These are all too common and generic.<br>However, if you then define further, and effectively mimic in detail existing copyrighted material BEYOND THE ATTRIBUTION OF HISTORY/MYTHOLOGY/COMMON BELIEF (i.e. include details which were 'invented' specifically by the copyright holder/licensor) then there's a risk that you could cross a line.<br><br>As far as rules go, just requiring that a success/failure is  related to the combination of a "dice roll" with modifiers that may be applicable according to "stats/abilities/skills/spells" or "items/equipment bonuses(bonii?)"
