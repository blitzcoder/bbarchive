In fact, some character sets, ,e.g. Korean Hangul, are actually <i>simpler</i> than Roman letters once you know how they work (Hangul has only 24 "logically designed" letters, not even upper or lower case... although some publications do still use Hanja as well).<br><br>As for the original question...<br><br>You cannot learn a language by reading alone, in my opinion. As far as I see it, "study material" should always be a secondary asset that you use to fuel up on words, rules, and in this case, kanji, which you can then use creatively in some fashion. That means finding some friends to talk and write to, and at least one native speaker who can steer you back to correctness when you go wrong. Or, preferably, some good ol' total immersion.<br><br>Certainly for me this is the key to all things: skills (speaking, writing, programming) are to be <i>used</i>. If you're not at a level where you can use them for real, you set up a "safe testing" environment, where you can use them at a reduced level, until you are.<br><br>The other thing is that <i>unstructured</i> rote memorisation <i>does not work</i>, so don't expect to have much recall if all you do is look at lists of words and/or kanji. The best this will do is give you a short-term recall of the individual words (or a long-term recall of the whole list, which serves no purpose) - you then need to apply the knowledge while it is fresh, to give it some kind of context in which it can sit (and to repeat this until you no longer need the original association-list memory). The basic-level memorisation techniques will vary from person to person and are usually general-purpose.<br><br>Another useful technique is to be able to build your knowledge in layers, combining multiple elements into a single new fact to reduce the complexity of the new item to remember (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elegance_%28mathematics%29#Beauty_and_mathematical_information_theory" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity" target="_blank">here</a>). Kanji are an obvious example of this: individual brush strokes are easy to learn. Once you can see brush strokes, you no longer need to process "implementation details" like the angles and lengths of lines within the character as a whole. Strokes form "radicals"; the simplified breakdown of radicals into strokes makes them easier to learn than by shape-memorisation alone; and then more complex characters can be learned by seeing them as combinations of radicals rather than a large number of strokes or a ridiculously complex mess of shapes and angles. In English this might be akin to recognising standard prefixes and suffixes more quickly than actually bothering to mentally spell them out, even when seeing a word for the first time. But the principle applies to all things: you can learn to recognise standard sentence fragments and their idiomatic meanings in much the same way.<br><br>Uh... &lt;/babble&gt;<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

These are very good concepts.<br><br>Part of my study material is vocabulary lists, in the form of 'japanese -&gt; english' words. <br>I deduce a way of applying what you said would mean making original sentences with these words, with them being in prominence and in different contexts (so as to be more valuable than simply rewriting the word again and again as a list). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
