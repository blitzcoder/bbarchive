You cannot express 6 possibilities with 5 states - there will be a double up.<br><br>Think about files - what are they?  Why do we need them?  They essentially store arrangements.  A text file needs enough bytes to store every character.  Say there is one byte per character.  You cannot store 100 characters in 99 bytes because there are not enough COMBINATIONS of bytes to express the possible combinations of letters.<br>Hopefully you're understanding my bad explanation.<br><br>Anyway, you seem to believe that it may possible to store 255 bytes in 3 bytes.  Behold the inherent problem in this:<br>In 255 bytes, there are 256^255 different combinations possible.  You are suggesting that EVERY ONE of those combinations can be represented in 3 bytes.  You are suggesting that 256^255 different combinations can be represented by 256^3 combinations.<br>3 bytes worth of data CANNOT represent 255 bytes worth of data.  3 bytes  CANNOT represent the same number of combinations as 255 bytes.<br><br><br>The counter argument to this would be "Well why is data compression possible then?  If we cannot represent the same number of combinations in less bytes than how is data compression possible?"<br><br>Data compression involves reducing redundacy in data.  When a file has unnecessary data or unnecessary repetition of data, it is compressable.  For example, text files unnecessarily represent each word over and over again.  This is a reason why they are so compressible - some of the data, the repetition of words, is redundant and can be removed.  In this case, a compression algorithm might replace all words in a text file with a two-byte long index - each index's corresponding word might be stored at the start of the file.<br><br>Infinite data compression is IMPOSSIBLE.  You need to get over that.  It is very possible to create compression techniques that reduce redundancy in files, but you cannot represent the same numbers of combinations in fewer numbers of bytes. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

JPG is great for images. MP3 is good for music. ZIP is good for custom files on wich you can not realy code a decoder (lack of time/experience and so on).<br><br><div class="quote"> And like GFK said the line thing only specifies the length of a line, not accounting what direction, RGB values, and maybe even width. <br></div><br>This work must do the encoder. Ok this is not realistic for me (lack of time and so on). I use this way only to encode 8-bit images. It is the best way. At end the compressed zip file was higher sized than the original file:<br><br>1. use half-bytes (4bit) to store information chunks (like x, y coordinates)<br>2. encode colorized rectangles from left to right and up to down. Save only size and color information.<br>3. save a little bit about the width &amp; height of the image. Oh.. this is not needed. I use standard 16x16 Pixels.<br><br>The following tile graphic needs only 30 bytes into the file. It is saved with 90° angle (do not forget the 8 pixel rectangle limit) because this compress even better.<br><br><img src="http://www.handyrpg.com/images/handyrpg_screens/800_600_graphicset_implementedbackground3.jpg"><br><br>calculate it a little up and it is a good compression (16 tiles per tileset. 30 tilesets are available and so on...).<br><br>Saved the single entity as file and compressed with zip, the file is bigger. ~7 Months ago i compressed 4000 tile-images into a archive (zip). The archive was bigger than the files on my hard drive. This must mean i do use already good compression (data limited compression).<br><br>There are so many compression posibilitys... you must only do hard-coding and think about that what the code should save!!! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
