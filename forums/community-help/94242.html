I guess everyone wants to print photos and that means color inkjet to most people. I've nothing against color inkjet printers per se. I just don't want to pay for coloured inks when I won't be using them, and most of the color inkjet printers seem to follow the old "it's cheaper to throw the printer out and buy a new one than fill up on the inks" mantra. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's color laser, and MFC, and not wireless (though it is networked so just hit it with ethernet and you can print from your wireless devices on network...) so not exactly what you're looking for but they have been, bar none, the best printers I've ever had the dubious fortune to use (all printers are evil. this is documented scientific fact...). The carts are pricy (as all laser carts are) but they last a LONG time to the cost per page is very small (as it is with all laser). Since it's not wet ink they don't go dry due to only occasional use (very important if you don't print much). The print quality has been fantastic for me. And the extra bells and whistles of the MFC are really nice (scanner is good, not amazing but it gets the job done AND it has an auto feed which is REALLY handy for scanning documents and contracts etc.), scanning to a PDF and having it mailed straight from the device is very handy for simple stuff (just scan, check mail, have document). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I was beginning to think it was only *my* printers which were. I can't see spending all the extra on a color printer though.

You say that you are only printing a few dozen sheets per month, which would not stretch even the cheapest inkjet. All decent inkjets have a dedicated black ink cartridge, and on some there are high capacity cartridges available that are very economical (e.g. HP 940XL - £16.35 for estimated 2200 pages)<br><br>Most printers come with all the cartridges included: you would not need to buy any that you would not be using. But you might actually find that you occasionally want to print in colour, which is not something you could do with a monochrome laser printer anyway. Do you have access to a scanner or photocopier already? If not then would you not find a printer/scanner/copier useful?<br><br>I'm not saying you should buy an inkjet, ultimately that is your decision to make, I'm just asking why you have firmly ruled them out. In my experience, most problems with inkjets occur if they are not used for long periods (six months or more) because the print heads get blocked up. But it does not sound like this would apply to your situation.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The downsides are the upfront cost, the sticker shock when you need new toner (but really cost per page is lower so you just have to choke it down) and the lack of a new shinny gadget as you won't be trashing old inkjets regularly.<br><br>Now that I think about it I've never seen a laser get thrown away, just re-purposed. I know plenty of people still rocking laserwriters from back in the day... thats getting your money's worth, 26 YEARS of reliable printing from one device, the headache is keeping up with the adapters to make it work with a modern computer without an ADB or LPT port... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I think it's down to lazy design with no interest to fix it since it means more ink is sold (which is where the profit is, that's why they literally give printers away, I've got 3 free ones in the attic that have never been opened...). Generally if you set your print job to B&amp;W or grayscale specifically it won't use the color, but this isn't a steadfast rule. Not sure why they mix the colors in with the black when the content is just black but they seem to, so I chalk it up to "we can make it darker by dumping extra ink then they have to buy more". <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
