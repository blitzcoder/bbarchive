If they asked Mark for permission in email and then go and sell it on eBay, I don't see anything wrong with that. Asking the guy they're doing out of a sale to pay for them to undercut him and advertise as much seems way over the line to me. Naturally, I'm sure everyone would say "I'm not advertising it, I just asked here because the contact form looked like it was broken and I know it's working now but it definitely didn't look like it was working when I tried it and besides, I wasn't sure if Mark spoke English, and it'd be rude to just ask him when I could make a public issue of it to try and force his hand." But yeah, seems pretty discourteous, to say the least, to me. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
