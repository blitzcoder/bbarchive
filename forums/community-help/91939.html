Anyways, transpires that you are better off with a dedicated home cinema system than separates (unless your an audio purist....) for a couple of reasons:-<br><br>1. Home cinemas use less lecky than separates<br>2. They're better priced.<br><br>Anyhow, I've got one of these little beauties on order, due to arrive Tuesday - might be retiring my stereo with the huge JBL speakers now:<br><br><a href="http://www.wheresells.co.uk/sony-bdv-e370.html?k=7365&amp;a=5184737812&amp;s=ga&amp;gclid=CIyO6dO7kKQCFYiX2AodGHpxJA" target="_blank">http://www.wheresells.co.uk/sony-bdv-e370.html?k=7365&amp;a=5184737812&amp;s=ga&amp;gclid=CIyO6dO7kKQCFYiX2AodGHpxJA</a><br><br>Its got 850 watts of soundage, I'm guessing that must be summed output.<br><br>AND it only uses 28 Watts of power.... must be magic (;-) From the reviews it certainly sounds it, standby power is impressively low at less than half a watt. <br><br>So,  now I'll (only) be saving around a 100 watts of power &amp; have lurvly 5.1 surround sound to boot, Oh yeah and I can see what everyone has been raving about with respect to the Blu-ray format. I was considering getting a PS3 for its mutliplicity however seeing as it uses a massive 175 watts of power (a massive 50 watts more than the XBox360), I'll be saving 145 ish watts of lecky by not buying the PS3. Whoops correction, the PS3 uses 186 watts during HD DVD playback. Thats an even bigger leccky saving! I confess, I (may) miss playing some of the Ps3 specific titles, but I've enough other gaming bits and bobs to see me through. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The speaker ain't amazing, but at least I know I'm saving some money.<br><br>On a semi-related subject, I got a letter from the electricity company last week. I had been paying £25 a month for my 1 bedroom flat, and the electricity company said I was in credit and they owed ME £3.68. On the same letter they said they wanted to increase my monthly payments to £86! Always check your bills, eh? They put it back to £25... Anyway, sounds like a good system :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you watched a Blu Ray and then an upscaled DVD and you didn't know beforehand which was which you probably wouldn't notice.<br><br>The Sony home cinema system your looking it s a pretty decent one for an entry level system and will do everything you need, I think spending much more is a waste unless you're a huge audiophile.<br><br>Darkheart <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You can count each single hair if the Blu-Ray is made with a decent quality. In a few movies it's even too much as you see the makeup or how cheap certain stuff is done in the background. I don't bother this much about 5.1 sound. I'm sure it sounds great but fiddling around with two speakers already is enough for me. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I haven't replaced any of the DVDs I own with Blu Ray and never intend to, it just doesn't make enough difference.<br><br>By contrast I had to do without my 5.1 setup for a week while I had some speaker cable repaired and going back to the stereo speakers on the TV was a very noticeable drop in quality and although the surround isn't a big deal on many titles, you miss it when its not there.<br><br>Darkheart <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
