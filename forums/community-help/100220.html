For example, Nexuiz is a heavily-modified Quake.<br><br>The answer is slightly more complex than skidracer makes out: you can add whatever code you like as long as the <i>whole project</i> is built of GPL-compatible components. If for instance you use or write BSD- or MIT-licensed modules, that code stays copyright you/whoever, and stays MIT-licenced <i>when viewed on its own</i>, but the GPL overrides it for the project as a whole because the GPL is "stronger". Copyright of each module stays with whoever wrote it, and the combined work is a shared copyright of the authors of each component.<br><br>The important thing is that each part be GPL-<i>compatible</i>. This is no problem for permissive licences like MIT (since they basically let you do whatever you want anyway), but some licences have terms that conflict with the GPL, e.g. The Qt licence. It is illegal to distribute a program built using both GPL and Qt components to anyone other than yourself because it's impossible to meet all of the requirements. Same goes for BRL's BlitzMax modules prior to the version where they all became BSD (or whatever the new licence is).<br><br>This is because the GPL (and Qt for that matter) places restrictions upon the entire resulting project as part of the agreement for using the GPL'd code in the first place. One of its extra restrictions is that the entire project must be licenced under terms that give it the same protection as the GPL or better, this effectively translates to "everything it touches turns to more GPL". (This sounds unreasonable initially, but it's not: a licence can insist that you wear a pink hat while reading the code if it wants to - it's you who decides to agree to the restrictive terms, or to use something else.)<br><br><br>There's also some disagreement over whether it's relevant, but the FSF also frowns upon using limited-access compilers to write or deploy GPL'd code. They certainly get annoyed when discussing iOS. BlitzMax <i>might</i> be seen as a similar violation-in-spirit because of the compiler being commercial.<br><br><br>Anyway short answer is that what you want to do is exactly what the GPL was created for. Just remember that any reused code remains copyright of its original authors.<br><br><br>However, you absolutely must <i>read and understand the whole thing</i> before so much as touching anything licenced under it. If you don't read a licence it's your own fault if you get sued. You absolutely <i>cannot</i> just "wing it" and skip reading the licence when developing. If you don't understand it, consult a lawyer, or do not use GPL'd code. You can normally find the full text of the licence in a file called "COPYING" in source distributions. You probably clicked through to ignore it a few times when installing binaries of software (e.g. Firefox) as well.<br><br>GO BACK UP AND READ THAT LAST PARAGRAPH! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
