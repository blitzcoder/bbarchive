Actually, I guess I could do what other video editing programs do and make it process slowly, but it's a lotta work for something I only need now, and possibly again down the road a piece, so I thought I'd take a crack at asking you guys since you probably have a lot more combined knowledge of what programs exist than I do. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It was a 3d animation editor, and once I got it working pretty well at the testing phase of 3 frames, I... went right up to the finished phase of 30 frames. After I hit f5, the screen was black for waaay longer than usual, then I smelled burning plastic. But then the editor came up, and it worked! I turned it off, and found out the 4 prong power plug that goes to motherboard had 2 prongs that were burnt. The computer worked for about a week after that. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Took me months to track that bugger down, and I only managed it because after yet another power outage, I went to turn the computer on and it didn't work.  Eventually I dismantled the PSU and found that a fuse inside it (one of the glass ones) had completely exploded.  Replaced the PSU, power never tripped off again. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Now the video making program I'm afraid to use could technically throw together thousands of bmps very quickly, but the most I ever dared to do was 30, seeing that it did do them so quickly. Please explain this 100 percent thing to me a bit more, I'm fascinated by computer science, but too lazy to study it. No, sometimes I just like to wonder about things, and learn about them as they come to me. Like when I first heard about the absolute origin of the computer term "bug".

Basically a idle cpu will throttle down, which means it will have a moderate power draw. Under full load it will need considerably more power, and since this all translates to heat, insufficient cooling will "fry" the cpu.<br><br>Like gfk said, cpus will most likely shut down as a protective measure when they reach critical temperatures. This is a fairly new feature though, and it might or might not be enabled (in bios etc) even if the chip have support for it. If you have a old chip it might quite literally catch on fire, but afaik the usual signs of more modest overheating damage is the chip behaving like its on a unstable oc even under acceptable temperatures and clocks.<br><br>What you described sounds more like a psu issue though, and gfk/tomtoad is probably on the right track here :) Altough a poor quality psu might go haywire by itself and fry things when its under too much load. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I have a nice surge protector that even has a varyingly flickering amber light, which I assume is to show me the irregularities it's taking care of.

Wow, this topic's branched off a lot, but I think that's good. If I can feel more secure, maybe I can just fire up that old video frame editor I made. In the meantime, still no one knows of a good one? By the way, the first computer bug was an actual living bug, a moth that landed on a light representing a 1, thus rendering the light and the moth a very undesirable 0. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
