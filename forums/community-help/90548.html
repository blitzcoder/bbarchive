(the infamous "third shift" competition.<br><br>Or one of the weirdest cases was NEC a number of years ago, which found that some other company had started selling knock-offs under their brandname in Asia... but they had store fronts, factories, and even did their own R&amp;D and started creating their own product lines, all without the knowledge of NEC itself... Only reason they found out is when they started getting large numbers of returns of broken devices with serial numbers that did not show up in their databases.<br><br>As far as Foxconn is concerned - This company is in an entire different realm than most people would expect. They produce pretty much *everything* these days. they manufacture components and products for Intel, Sony, Apple, and most of the other major companies. They apparently have over <b>400,000</b> people working for them.<br>Yes, they've had a recent rash of suicides, which definitely should be looked into... But keep in mind that with that many employees, you're always bound to have some, even if the company were paradise to work for.
