Useless without the key, and may be locked to the BIOS of the PC it came with. (e.g. an HP reinstall disc may 'magically' work without a serial number on particular HP motherboards that would have come with the same version of windows installed, but refuse to activate on other hardware without a working key)<br><br>Basically, there is several different version, each with different releases:<br><br>- Retail. "full", boxed copy. Will install on a PC, and the license allows you to UNINSTALL &amp; reinstall on another PC if you upgrade down the road.<br>- OEM. bundled with hardware, tied to the motherboard that it was first installed on. Can't move to your next PC. (technically it can, but you'd violate the MS EULA)<br>- Upgrade. Requires you to have another OS (XP, Vista) installed on the PC already, which will then be replaced by your Win7. Note that using the upgrade -invalidates- the old OS license, so you can't re-use your old XP/vista license on another PC or virtual machine (Again -- technically you can, but you'd violate the MS EULA)<br><br>On top of that there's the distinction between Starter, Home Premium, Professional, Ultimate and Enterprise versions of all of the above.<br><br>Starter is completely stripped down. Can't use multiple logins, can't customize (can't even set a desktop background image) (used to?) also limit the # of programs that can run simultaneously. Undesirable.<br><br>- Starter is mostly found in 'developing nations', or on low-end netbooks in the US.<br><br>- home premium is the most common version installed on your typical PC you buy at a big-box store. Comes with some multi-media tools. Has everything a typical home user cares about. 64 bit version is limited to 16GB RAM.<br><br>- Professional is aimed at corporations, and supports joining corporate active directory domains, and some remote management stuff. does not include the multi-media stuff, although you can download those from MS for free. 64bit version supports up to 192GB RAM.<br><br>- Ultimate is essentially the same as professional, plus the multimedia tools from home Premium lumped in.<br><br>- Enterprise is pretty much identical to ultimate, except it's only offered under corporate contracts and includes a virtualization license, can't buy this one in a store, only through a MS enterprise agreement.<br><br><br>with the OEM version you EITHER get the 32 or 64 bit disc, although the same serial <i>should</i> work with either version if you borrow the other disc down the road. (Of course, you can only have one active installation with any serial number) IIRC All others come with both 32-bit and 64-bit discs, and you can pick which version you install. Unless you have old software or hardware that won't work with a 64-bit OS, that's probably the recommended version now. the vast majority of PC's you'd buy in a store will have the 64-bit version preinstalled these days.<br><br>Note that the upgrade version will only install on your PC if a qualifying OS is already present -- e.g. you'd need to install XP first, and then the Windows 7 install disc will detect it, and allow you to blow it away to do a fresh install. without the older OS present first, you can't install win 7. If you currently have Vista you can do an actual upgrade it to Win7 and retain your existing settings/programs, as long as you stick with the same bit-ness (32-to-32 or 64-to-64).<br>You cannot upgrade XP to Windows 7 directly, although it will recognize it as a valid, legal upgrade path, it will NOT retain your old settings/programs in the process.<br><br>The OEM version will only allow a fresh install (wipe HDD, install from scratch), noupgrades.<br><br>The Retail version will allow either upgrades or fresh installs. Most flexible, but (of course) also the most expensive of the bunch. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There's zero reason NOT to upgrade to Windows 8 at this time. If you don't like Modern UI, install ClassicShell or Start8 or some other tool that restores the old start menu. When you buy Windows 8 now, you will get the 8.1 upgrade for free.<br><br>If your computer has a 64-Bit CPU and at least 2 GB RAM, I would --NOT-- install a 32-Bit version of Windows anymore. The license key that you will buy works with both builds, and although OEM versions only come with one architecture DVD, it is --LEGAL-- to download the ISO for the other architecture from Microsoft's own servers and re-install the OS with your license key. But as it was already mentioned, of course, you can only use the key on one PC. (Unless you're downgrading the OS on a new PC from, let's say, Windows 8 Pro to Windows 7 Pro - then Microsoft allows you to use the same key twice. But in the case of Windows 8 you can ONLY downgrade legally from the Pro version to Windows 7 Pro. The license does not allow you to downgrade from Windows 8 to Windows 7 Home Edition, for example. Only the Windows 8 Pro editions come with downgrade rights.)<br><br>That being said, selling USED OEM licenses is fully legal in Germany and probably in several other European countries as well. An OEM version of Windows 7 Professional can be bought on eBay in Germany for around 27 Euros. (Most of those OEM versions come from recycled Dell machines, which doesn't matter at all - OEM licenses can legally be transferred under German laws.) That money will buy you the DVD and the COA license sticker; the DVD is of no importance, the license sticker is the thing that will make the license legal. As I've said: This is fully legal under GERMAN(!) laws. But when you're buying the OEM version on ebay.de, German laws apply. Full stop.<br><br>American laws are different, and, thank God, not applicable outside the US. While transferring (used) OEM licenses from one PC to another might be illegal in the US, German courts found Microsoft's license terms to be illegal. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
