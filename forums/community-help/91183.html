The transfer time is limited by the SATA speed, so it's the same for both.<br><br>Raid 10 with 2 drives (fault tolerance) should be used, since the Raid 10 4 drive (fault tolerance+speed) speed benefit is probably not noticable with SSD drives. Hmm, actually Raid 10 with 2 drives seems the same as Raid 1 with 2 drives, but I'm not entirely sure if it's the same thing, there might be some differences when declaring it as Raid 10 array instead of Raid 1 array.<br><br>I've heard that SSD drives have quite low amount of write times compared to HDs, so that's why the Raid 10 might be good to have.<br><br>But then again, SSD drives are being improved all the time, so I don't know how many write times the newest generation has.<br><br>But you should first fix your code, since no application should ever need to do a full table scan, but always single lookups + while loops (when multiple lookups for the same base key is needed where all records are in sequence). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

A single disk, a raid or what?<br><br>I have an X25 SSD in my laptop, which more or less doubled the performance of the machine. Everything loads twice as fast and the whole thing feels much more snappy. It's mainly random access that you'll be gaining a lot with. Of course, this is going from a 2.5" laptop drive, so if you're going from at 15.000RPM disk, the change may not be so big.<br><br>There are alternatives. There are SSD disks made for servers (which I think can take more rewrites), there are normal raids, which if big enough can get read speeds of more than 300-400mb/sec. And there are RAM raids, which are insanely fast.<br><br>Lately I've been looking at GlusterFS, which probably isn't suitable for an Oracle database, but is very cool. It lets you combine a number of computers with their local storage (raid, disks, whatever), into one storage pool, with or without redundancy. The cool thing about it is that the more machines you add, the bigger and faster the storage becomes. It's probably most useful when you have many machines accessing the storage at the same time, as the load will get distributed across all the servers. :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
