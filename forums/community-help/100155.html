So far, have got a couple of good impressions and a few complaints.<br><br>So far:<br><br><b>The good:</b><br>-Nice build, it feels nice quality albeit a tad heavy (about 1.5x-2x the weight of my Asus transformer without it's "extra-battery keyboard")<br>-the screen is responsive and clear.<br>-The mag-snap keyboard is quite brilliant and is responsive enough to type quickly on.<br>-Windows 8 odd interface is quite good on it.<br>-Is a good size for this kind of device.<br>-Has a fold out stand which is much more reliable and stable than the mag-fold cover on the ipad, and the non-existant one on my transformer (without the keyboard on that is).<br>-Sound seems ok, not as loud as i would like, but it is clear.<br>-I like the fact it has a desktop as well as metro (or whatever it is called). It seems you get "proper" multitasking within "desktop" mode as opposed to  the sleeping-app style with metro. This could be useful if you want battery vs performance use, eg: if you want to listen to a youtube music channel while using word. <br><br><b>The bad:</b><br>-weight (already mentioned) but it is by no means a brick. (think between iPad2 &amp; iPad3 weight)<br>-apps are very slow to load when you first load them, much slower than on iOS or android.<br>-no English language available on setup (wtf??) ok it is a scandinavian model with SE,DE,NO &amp; FI but seriously??! It means I have to use my second language Swedish to work with it. This is the worst thing i have found yet.<br>-top of the keyboard/cover is kind of covered in "fuzzy-felt" stuff which i can imagine will get really dirty and stained quick, and would be difficult to clean.<br>-i found the mag-snap power lead difficult to get in at first for some reason.<br>-really needs google maps (not impressed with bing maps much, although it does not seem to be a train wreck like apple maps).<br><strike>-Battery life is not good. Charged it yesterday and it is already almost empty. I have hardly used it (perhaps 2-3hrs.. i get about 6-8 out of my Transformer and ipad) I hate to think what the intel version will be like.</strike> Edit: changed my mind about this, batt-life is actually quite good.<br>-When undocked the keyboard is not automatic when you click in a text field (you need to press a button for it) which gets a little tiresome. (EDIT: actually it works in metro, but not in windows mode, however the display does not adjust so you can see what you are typing !! LOL!. I installed the "google" app which is an RT light version of chrome and thankfully they have the address bar at the top :D. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

To be honest i would not have bought one, but we only got it to investigate porting to it, so it is not really -my- machine. <br><br>I much prefer my android tablet so far for "tablety stuff" but that said cannot really see RT being more useful than android... not in the near future anyway. (unlike the pro version.. but on that side of things the battery sucks in comparison so i guess it depends what you want to do on a tablet. For me it is all about just watching reading browsing and light use, remote control of PCs etc..., with as much battery time as possible)<br>That said, despite it's flaws i prefer it to my iPad in all ways except battery time (ipad is good at that) and availability of apps.<br><br>I think if MS iron out the flappy flaws  i mention above and get more useful software, it could be a handy device. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Certainly at the moment RT is just not good enough in terms of performance improovements (Battery life, Device support etc.) to justifiy it's existence compared to Android or IOS.
