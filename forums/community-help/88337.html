You're right, both is important: recording quality (dry, clean, min 44.kHz16b), but also actor qualities. With diffrent accents it may be possible to use one voice for a number of characters, including the use of a few halftones pitchshifting and individual reverb etc. But it's rather impossible to make a female voice out of a male one. (Pitch shifting alone won't do it).<br><br>There is indeed an amateur voice actors community, not sure why I didn't see this yet. Might be a good idea to register there. Although I'm afraid this is going to cost some money, probably a lot (or in other words: the more dialogs, the more costs). Maybe I'll try to combine real voices with TTS ones. But I'd have to find a good TTS app first. It would however make the production much easier.<br><br>Ross, thanks for your offer, I've noticed it and will contact you later. Scottish might fit in perfectly when I storywise set that castle map location to Scotland.<br><br>Currently I'am working on Mesh content, but I hope I can work on the dialogs soon. <br><br>It's kind of a challenge anyway to do dialogs with lipsync motion in a FPS, made by a Blitz Indie Bedroom Inc... I mean, without Mimic Mocap and other costy things. But it's quite fun when it starts working to some degree. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
