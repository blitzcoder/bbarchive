If they aren't configured properly, they may be handing out overlapping IP addresses causing collisions.<br><br>Probably more likely: someone connected with their business laptop, and instead of getting a DHCP address, it was still configured for a static IP address that happened to be in the same local area network block as the hotel was using (very likely, since the vast majority of local networks either use the 10.0.0.x range, or 192.168.1.x)<br>If the laptop is using an address in the same range it will work -- but the hotels DHCP service will be unaware of it, which means that it will happily hand out the same address to someone else. <br>(DHCP keeps track internally of which addresses have been handed out, but if you configure an IP manually it won't know about it)<br><br>Now, normally windows should detect an IP conflict and ask the DHCP server for a different one, and things should work themselves out fairly quickly...  But bottomline: it is actually a very common occurance. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Thank god; when the population of the world is over 6.5 billion, even 4.2 billion doesn't go very far. O_o  <br></div><br><br>It's been around for years, but uptake has been very, very slow... It's one of those chicken-and-the-egg things: Everyone would benefit if everyone switched over, but there is very little to gain by being first... So everyone is waiting for everyone else to switch over first.<br><br>The 4.2billion limit is somewhat mitigated by the fact that you can share a single IP with many users through NAT (Network Address Translation), although that does reduce its functionality somewhat (if your ISP runs you behind a NAT firewall, you can't run services for example)<br><br>Most likely East Asia will lead the push towards IPv6 because the issue is much more immediate for them: they are rapidly running out of address space. The country of China, for example, has less IP addresses assigned to them than MIT alone owns. (MIT has a full class A, which is 16,777,216 addresses. There are a bunch of other large US corporations as well that own similar blocks -- some of the large telcos actually have more than one thanks to mergers over the years)<br>We'll probably all end up with IPv6 in the end, but it will be many more years before it will be common in the western world.<br><br>(If you've never seen an IPv6 address: they can be a bit of a hassle to work with. A 'normal' IPv4 address looks something like this: 10.34.56.178, while an IPv6 address would look like this: 3ffe:1900:4545:3:200:f8ff:fe21:67cf <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
