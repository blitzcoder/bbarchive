Can you show me where the center of gravity would be on it? I've tried searching google to figure out where the average center of gravity would be on a regular vehicle but I never get any answers. Basically I just want to know whether it would be closer to the front or the back and how far down it should be. I need to know so I can actually set the Center of Mass setting in PhysX to something more appropriate. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In PhysX though, the wheels don't have any settable mass and for some odd reason, when making a vehicle you have to set the center of gravity/mass yourself of the car. I don't understand why that isn't automatic. But thanks for the answer, it helps a lot. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In the case of articulated lorries and vehicles with more than 2 sets of wheels, the wheel sets ought to be positioned according to the proportion of weight distribution between the chassis and the cargo.<br><br>This is why you get the typical answer.<br><br>[]_[=======]<br>O..O......O<br><br>Neat drawing, huh? :)<br><br>The front wheels are 1/4 the total length of the truck apart from the next set of wheels.

Therefore the centre of mass will be proportional distance from the middle.<br><br>I don't use PhysX, so I can't comment on how it works, but without knowing the mass of the chassis and the cargo and 'combine' them with the wheels to make a single unit, there's no means to automatically calculate the centre of mass.<br><br>In most cases, the centre of mass for Z axis is likely to be further towards the rear, but only slightly.<br><br>If the front wheels and rear wheels are not equally spaced from the front and rear of the vehicle, you will have more slight variation, though unless this is a ridiculously large difference, this variation can pretty much be considered negligible.<br><br>Hope that helps :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
