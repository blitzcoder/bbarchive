I can pretty easily compare normal features like speed and memory but I also would like to be able to write programs or apps for whatever I end up getting and I have no idea how to know which phones support writing apps and which ones don't.  What languages (besides monkey) do people generally use to make apps for android and other smart phones?  I am considering buying monkey but I also want to learn some Java and see all my options before I make any purchases.<br><br><br>So in short:<br>1.

Otherwise you simply won't be able to interface with what's provided.<br><br>You still <i>can</i> use other languages - I'm not terribly up to speed on Android development, but I assume porting any JVM language isn't too hard (e.g. <a href="http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/scala-ide/Developing_for_Android" target="_blank">you can use Scala</a> to take some of the pain out of Java), and iOS projects can include static libraries compiled in advance, so for instance it is possible to write native Haskell code for iOS via GHC's LLVM backend. You have to <i>really want</i> this though, as the toolchains aren't designed with it in mind.<br><br>Even if you use a high-level-&gt;high-level language compiler (like Monkey), unless you want to be very limited in what you can do (e.g. produce a 2D Monkey game without the native UI), you still need a working command of the host language in order to link your code into the app framework (e.g. if you wrote an iOS app in Gambit Scheme, you'd need to integrate the C code manually because the Gambit compiler can't export Xcode projects).<br><br>So...<br><br><br><div class="quote"> Pros and cons of different languages? <br></div><br><br>...Objective-C and Java have an unfair advantage as the platform languages you have to be able to use for at least a thin wrapper. Other than that, it's the same question as it is for PC.<br><br>So: if you intend to make a UI- and media-heavy app, suck it up and write a thin shell of app logic in the platform language and put most of your effort into the media/UI layer. If you intend to make a logic-heavy app (scientific calculator? I don't know), you can probably afford to look into alternative toolchains for a language that suits your needs, and write the large quantities of self-contained logic in that. But it won't be worth finding an alternative language unless you actually get to do most of your work in it; otherwise, you'll spend more time gluing components together than working in your language of choice.<br><br>Prepackaged solutions like Monkey don't have this problem, as long as what is packaged suits your needs. Monkey isn't the only tool available in this category (although offhand I couldn't name any others, except my own which isn't available yet).<br><br><br><div class="quote"> Does java work on smart phones? <br></div><br><br>Android is <i>powered by</i> Java (or at least, a modified JVM). You can also use native code if you like, but it's not necessary, and officially not recommended (many people do though).<br><br>iOS does not officially support Java at the moment.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It is also handy to have a cheap tablet like a nexus, archos or kindle too. (PS Android 3 is ONLY for tablets, so for phones it goes 2.2, 2.3, 4.0....etc. Also, 80-85% of android world is now &gt;= 2.2 and it moves all the time so i would not even allow &lt;2.2 to see your apps)<br><br>I would say try both, start by buying some cheap crap devices from ebay or a mate who has upgraded and get going. While to be a successful android developer you should have at least 3 very different devices to test with, i would say the cost and hassle of android is a lot less than that on iOS, although if you are interested in returns then iOS tends to net a good app between 25-40% more depending on strategy than on android.<br>Start collecting :D<br>As a point of note, for iOS you also need a fairly decent Mac. We as a company have spent about $22000 on iOS dev as opposed to about $6000 on android. (iOS price is hiked massively simply because of the cost of the essential macbook pros). Of course those prices are retail prices, we get the vat back of course.<br><br>2) iOS is C/objC only, Android is Java/C++, however there are many programs and translators like monkey, unity, titanium etc that allow you to code in other languages (but they still need to translate it to native code). The downside of this is compiling-running on device is much slower and on some can make debugging difficult by being reduced to using a log or console echo.<br><br>3) <br>In my opinion obj-c is not nice and is different from everything (think what english is to german -vs- english to chinese). Java is a nice beginners language as it is high level, very similar to MAX in many ways, but also gets you used to using libs, workspaces, build paths etc.. C# is almost the same thing as Java, except slightly more organized. This puts practice into play if you ever want to go lower level to C / C++ etc.<br><br>4) <br>-Android yes, (and seamlessly).<br>-iOS. no* <br>-Windows mob, yes.<br>-Blackberry yes.<br>-Dumb-phones yes,  (those old mobiles often have lightweight JVMs for simple games).<br> <br><br>*EDIT: An iOSJVM exists but the man from apple.. he say no!!  &gt;:(<br><br>A little bit of searching reveals some tools that allow Java to Objective C or C translation, the output of which does appear suitable for building iOS apps in Xcode.<br><br>-so basically no.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I suppose I will start off with Java at least for now because I am taking a class on it next semester anyway!  Might as well try to stay a little ahead of the curve.<br><br>I wonder if people will be able to make games for google glass... It would definitely be harder without the use of a physical interface <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
