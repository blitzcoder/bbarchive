The thing is, I'm putting £10 of credit on it each month because if I don't, the thing sucks up £1 worth of data per day (O2's maximum data charge) and that might not sound like much but if you look at it as if I'm spending £30 a month on a phone I hardly use, it's all getting a bit silly.<br><br>It's only running Android 2.2 and there was talk of an Android 2.3 upgrade but that never happened and even if it had, Android is WAY beyond that now.  There is absolutely nothing I can do to stop this thing from sucking up data by itself and O2 charging me for the privilege.  Turning off data services etc does not make any difference whatsoever.<br><br>So... anybody recommend a NORMAL, non-smart phone that lets me call people, send/receive SMS/MMS, maybe a decent-ish camera and that isn't going to cost me money to have it sat on my desk doing nothing? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'd say just go grab something cheap. If all it does is make calls all phones can do that just fine at this point. IMO there was never that big a difference between a "good" phone and a "bad" phone call quality wise back in pre-smartphone days anyway, but then I'm not picky about my audio quality. If you don't need something specific then get something cheap, no sense in spending extra money on something that just sits there 90% of the time, save it for when you inevitably switch back to a smart phone (the world will force you, maybe in a month, maybe a year, maybe 5) and you can get something then that makes you happy to own it instead of annoyed all the time.<br><br>p.s. NEVER trust a manufacturer saying they'll update an android phone. They have *nothing* to gain and lots to lose by upgrading it. Upgrades are quite rare even on flagship devices, and best case they'll be incremental. Fundamentally they want you to buy a new phone, what better way than making your old one obsolete? Also they have to pay to test the software, and the carriers have to pay to get it to their customers, etc. all they want is you to buy a new phone and re-up a contract, helping you hurts them so they don't do it. A tiny bit of good will with a few android addicts that at this point are already expecting to buy new hardware anyway really doesn't make up for all the real world costs and hassles they incur. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I imagine the same is true with Android phones -- even the lowliest should have enough oomph to give you a decent experience. I'd always recommend people to look at a Windows phone after using one, though, as the UI seems particularly well suited to the domain.
