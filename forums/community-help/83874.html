This normally means a complete system, or a hard drive, or CPU etc.  Depends on the vendor as to how lax they feel like being though:  I once asked an online vendor how much hardware I needed to buy in order to be able to pick up an OEM copy of something, and he said that since (these days) you really kind of need a mouse to be able to do much with a computer, I could pick up a $10 mouse and in his mind that would qualify.  I don't know that I'd go <b>that</b> far though...<br><br>Apart from that, it should be all-but exactly the same software as the retail version (perhaps different/reduced packaging).<br><br>There's another kind of OEM software that consists of the sort of stuff Dell (for example) bundles with their systems, and oftentimes they're tailored only to work on what they're supposed to be bundled with... but I don't expect you're asking about that. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It may only be used on the computer it was sold with.<br>- You get no installation support from MS with the OEM version, so for questions you must always return to the hardware vendor when something is wrong.<br><br>When looking at the Windows software itself you will see no difference, you will probably will notice this when reusing the software on different hardware.

It is a license violation to move it to a 'new' computer later on, even if you remove it from the original computer or even destroy the computer altogether.<br><br>that's also why the OEM version is cheaper than an upgrade or retail version: it's has more restrictions.<br><br>But even the retail and upgrade versions only allow a single install, you still can't run it on two computers, even if they are owned by the same person and you only run one at a time.<br><br>(The short answer about interpreting microsoft licensing terms: if you have any questions on how to interprete a specific clause, just go with whichever explanation makes the most money for microsoft -- it's invariably the 'correct' answer)<br><br>One danger of an OEM install is that Microsoft has at times been picky to define 'machine'. For example, should your motherboard die on you and need to be replaced, then you could run into issues re-activating Windows because the hardware change was too drastic for its likes) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
