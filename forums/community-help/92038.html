But I recently starting volunteering for some people am now tasked with helping to turn their paper-based course materials into digital products.<br><br>I totally and completely understand, and have stated so myself many times, that absolute protection of anything digital is impossible. But you can protect things from most of the people most of the time, using a variety of means.<br><br>My main question is, is there any way that I could deliver the document in a web browser and have it not be stealable (as much as possible)? I thought maybe to download images of the pre-generated text, kinda of like the `look inside this book` at amazon.com - however, it didn't take long for me to get access to the images used in their page viewer and to save them off to disk. In the Safari browser I just viewed the page activity, identified which files represented the images of the pages, and hey presto.<br><br>I thought maybe if there was some way to get imagery to display without there actually being any distinct saveable `images`, like downloading a stream of binary data and converting it into pixel data on-demand, maybe then the user could not save off the image, or use any tool to automate the downloading of the entire document. Of course they can still do a screen grab, but hey. Is there any way to do that? Or more to the point, is there any other way to deliver the document, make it readable and yet make it very difficult to pirate?<br><br>If not, I'm considering making the document be embedded and heavily encrypted into an executable app, and then trying to pull out all the stops like internet authentication and all that. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Ensure perhaps that some form of verified 'registration' is requireed before previews are obtainable.
