Google can get you a guide if you're determined. You're much more likely to have luck with a linux USB install since it's actually designed for it, rather than a hack job like XP.<br><br>Sounds like you may have drive issues, either the hard drive or the optical. Is the SSD native to the machine? Some SSD's need their own drivers. Some are not compatible with all drive controllers, could be a compatibility issue if it's aftermarket. The drive could also be failing (run a disk check on it). The optical drive could also be failing, if you have another drive you can try it's definitely worth a shot. Make sure you've removed all partitions and just let the windows installer make a new one for you from the empty space.<br><br>Your best bet assuming it's all original hardware is to get the recovery CD for the specific system. Dell's recovery CD's restore the system to out of the box condition, prepare all drive partitions, reinstall drivers and other stuff that they come with etc. You can order one from dell if you don't have it. They only work on the specific model they're intended for, so you need the recovery disc that matches your specific model number. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I have seen worse. Three or four years ago, all we could afford was an old Gateway Win98 desktop machine that had a 500MHz CPU and a horrible intel GPU. I can't imagine trying to run Blitz on that thing. It would take about ten minutes to start a 3d game and even then it was very very laggy. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
