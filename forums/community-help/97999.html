I have more crazy questions. I was thinking of going towards a career in programming, but when I was in college, I majored in Education and in my degree program, it didn’t require many computer classes (other than one on how to email, surf the web, etc.) and my degree didn’t require much mathematics either. In fact, I only had to take a somewhat consumer mathematics class that went over how to balance a checkbook or add percentages, etc. (I just had to pass 2 teachers exam that encompassed basic high school math). But, I’ve been enjoying the things that I’ve been learning with programming. I’ve been as of lately learning how to build websites with HTML and JavaScript, I’m going to learn Java and I mostly enjoy making web applications and will even delve into C++ too. So thus, I was wondering if I wanted a job in programming or so, would they still find it ok if I just have a degree in Education with absolutely no math? My other question regards certificates in programming or so. Are certificates even necessary? If so, are there any short routes to certain certificates? Once again, I’m sorry for asking crazy questions. Thanks<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

"Programming" isn't really a job, so much as a support skill for another job.<br><br>e.g. in a "generic corporate IT department" you might be doing database maintenance and a lot of interface coding. You need to know how databases work, but you <i>can</i> learn that stuff on the fly if your team and boss are tolerant. Such a place won't likely have any room for creativity though: the "job" here is to glue the company's dataflow together, not create cool things.<br><br>On the other hand, if you were to work at a defence contractor, you might be writing embedded software controlling weapon systems; for this you'd definitely need formal qualifications on hardware design, and would have approximately zero chance of being allowed in without an engineering degree. The "programming" for this one is probably less demanding, however.<br><br>So unless you want to get lumped with the monkey-work, you can't really rely on programming alone to create openings: your skills don't have to be in maths or engineering, but they should be in some field where you do have creative skills if you want to do creative work (e.g. 90% of web design is creating something that people won't click away from immediately: writing the code is a formality at most). "Programming" is just the way in which you go about being creative, and implement your designs. <br><br>(Also, you should <i>learn</i> at least a bit of maths: you don't need to be an accountant to write financial software, but you do need to be able to formally prove that it won't drop zeros if someone leaves the wrong screensaver on.)<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Often neglected but actually useful. Then then are hacked maths. Maths you can't really use in programming because it is too slow but are essential in programming. Even a degree in advanced maths won't help you there. Experience really.<br><br>Also many things you might find yourself doing in many games, such as in most games now you have a radar, in your main game you just turn the camera but a map might be static or have rotational physics around a point. Now you could use vectors or Sin/Cos trig maths. Either way is ok but if you're not experienced, figuring out how to do that could cost you a days work, or 20 minutes if you have made it before or even a few seconds if you have ready made maths libraries to do things. So I will make a nice function where you chuck in parameters and out pops your answer, but in the end you will forget what the maths even does. But you can't learn that sort of stuff, just comes from experience, and even the best programmers look in google. Past COMPLETED projects are so essential, and over a span of years too. I myself would laugh at a CV of someone who did 4 years in a programming degree and then had NO EXPERIENCE just tinkering around at home. These people are no hopers and would crumble at real challenges because they would be only motivated by assignments and these people usually do the minimum that is required of an assignment. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The question popped.<br><br>"So then Neil, what games have you been working on lately?"<br><br>The rest of the interview was a bit of a blur, but suddenly I had this overwhelming realisation how severely under prepared I was. "games" with an "s" too. I had brought a few scraps of paper with me with some of my art (I wanted to be an artist back then) but Jesus, I was basically an idiot. I had nothing, no half projects half finished even, I had barely even started anything, let alone finished and the few pages I had in my portfolio summing up my degree and 10 years of messing around on my Commodore Amiga. The awkward questions thick and fast but in the end all I had to talk about was stuff I had worked on during my degree only. The interview felt like a life time. It was traumatic, they were pretty nice guys, but yet I was dying inside with shame.<br><br>That was when I realised I needed to get out there and prove myself.

In those kinds of businesses it's usually fraud. haha Yes, it's usually those ad Marketing jobs were directors tell the people that they need to pay or buy certain equipment (from the director or their company)  in order for the people to sell the equipment. They know that some people need jobs, so many people actually do sign up. And that's how the DIRECTOR makes their money. The director takes the people's money and tell the people that they have to do all the work themselves lol. It's a very slick way to make money. Heck, I even thought about starting me a business like that hahaha (I'm joking)<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I  just to hear some ideas. I guess one problem with education that I was afraid of is when the government starts cutting back on their budgets, they usually cut back on the schools too and people get laid off and I guess I was just looking into some alternatives.  There can be many perks in education too i.e. we get 3 months worth of summer off and every other holiday including Christmas, Spring Break and countless others and it's pretty flexible in education to where I can just switch fields at will. If I get tired of teaching one subject I could switch to another and I guess I can just do programming within education. Heck, I’m always seeing reasons why we need more education games and software. So, maybe I’ll just do it that way.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
