These work by searching the process memory of the application and identifying changes in value that correspond to a given variable. To make it a little harder to hack, you could encrypt sensitive variables in your app. Create a type to store your lives. Create a 'new' instance of that type every time your bod dies and copy the lives count over to that. This moves the lives counter around in memory and makes things trickier. Also, encode the lives in a simple way, e.g XOR encryption.<br><br>Have a play with MHS (TM) and you will get a better idea of ways to fool the amateur.

Of course, most hackers have little problem locating these checks and jumping straight over them to bypass the checks.<br><br>Probably the most effective protection: Have several <i>delayed</i> checks, that don't kick in until after a certain calendar date, or a certain time after the install -- e.g. run another CRC32 check, but only after the game has been installed for -x- days, or only after xmas 2009.<br><br>That way a hacker may crack a game, appear fully functional, and gets released into the underground. All is fine, and others copy it as well. Then your trigger date rolls around, another CRC32 check runs, it finds that the binary was modified and it can take certain action such as refusing to run, displaying messages, etc.<br>Make sure to put the payload for this check in a different function than that of the 'initial' always-run check, or bypassing the first one may also kill the second in one swoop.<br><br>Most crackers will try to release their cracked copies early, to get the 'credit' for releasing the game. The delayed check means that while they appear successful at first, in the long run the effects are less. Even if they re-visit the program and find / dismantle the secondary protections as well, it still means that know there are multiple cracked copies floating around, only some of which are functional.<br><br>Other than that -- even multi-billion dollar companies like Microsoft and Adobe can't keep people from cracking their software. The best you can hope for is to slow things down a little, but you're walking a very fine line: if your checks are not 100% fool proof and burden legitimate customers, then you will be a lot worse off than losing a few copies to piracy in the first place. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Maybe an analogy..<br><br>Let's say the way to protect something is to lock it in a prison. Well, it seems like this is a good protection but the problem is there is now an `outside of the prison` where individuals can gain perspectives about the prison in a larger context. As such they might discover ways that the prison itself is limited, which it inevitably is, and thus discover how to pentrate it.<br><br>I personally think it is absolutely 100% impossible to 100% protect something, because the more you try to `separate it from hackers`, those very separations simply become more opportunity for hacking to occur. It's a no-win situation. It's like the more you put up walls, the more the walls themselves become your weakness. I believe, again talking very abstractly, it's because protection is always inherently limited, since it seeks to limit and be of limiting quality.<br><br>The only `true protection` is where there is no protection at all, and there is also no need to protect. While we have people who want to attack and hack and modify and overcome, defenses will always be insufficient, because by the very act of `defending` you choose weakness. Defence=attack and attack is a weakness, intending to weaken, and you can't do something to others without doing it to yourself. As you attempt to defend yourself you automatically undermine your integrity.<br><br>So what to do.. Either go with total openness and be easily ripped off, or put up a fight which inevitably is a losing battle. Perhaps the only option you have is to try to deter, delay, confuse, distract and generally throw hackers off the scent with smoke and mirrors, but it never will totally prevent an attack. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
