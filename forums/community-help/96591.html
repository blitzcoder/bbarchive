It took me years of hard graft to learn C++ and it is a much more demanding language than Blitz. Just because you're unpopular doesn't mean you can't use Blitz. Even if you got banned from the forums you could still use Blitz. Your problem is you have spent too much time chatting and not enough learning. <br><br>You need to study for an hour or so then take a break when you've had enough and go to Youtube and watch a cartoon or two, or whatever you do to relax and have some fun, then go back to your study. And stop chatting for no reason to people you've never met before, it's very distracting to study. If you're serious about game making then start putting in the hard work needed to get there. You need to be organized if you're going to succeed and that takes discipline. So write down in a notepad what you want your game to be like, be as detailed as you can, that's phase 1, planning. Phase 2 is development, actually coding the game and doing the artwork and sound/music. Learning the language is phase 1, you shouldn't attempt phase 2 until you have phase 1 done. To help you learn, browse through the code archives and try other peoples code, make sure you actually read the code carefully to understand it, look out for code that does what you want in your game, this is why you need to be organized. Go and read as many tutorials as you can. There's a couple of essential beginner ones there, make sure to read them as they save you a lot of time in the long run. Also read the help files explore all the sections you will need for your game. <br><br>Make sure you aren't trying to make a game that is too hard for you, like a MMORPG or even a FPS. Stick to 2d game making unless you're really crazy about a 3d game genre and are already a good 3d artist. There's lots of help around here on the forums if you can find it, so before posting a question type it into the search and see if it's already been answered, don't waste other people's time if you can help it but also don't be afraid to ask a question if you can't find it after a quick look. <br><br>That ought to be enough. I hope you are listening... Oh yeah, don't forget coding is not everything you need to find and learn other programs that do the art and sound, like Photoshop, etc.<br><br>PS: please remove the crucifix picture. I'm not sure if you're serious or not but it's inappropriate.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
