As for running it automatically after installation - that results in the VB6 front end getting confused about where it is running from - another slice of research required there with respect to Inno Setup, which is generally quite a good installation scripting tool. I suspect it maybe the limitations of VB6 (or how I've implemented it at the moment) that results in the front end beleiving it is running from the download directory as opposed to the installed directory.<br><br>As for the download - it seemed to bounce from 28m down to 4 then 1 min (within the space of 50 seconds or so) estimated download time - I was shocked to see it at 28m initially - what is the typical download time that you should expect for 25MB these days? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
