Even a  fully patched win98 machines contains dozens of known vulnerabilities with exploit code in the wild. There *are* networks of compromised machines that are actively scanning IP ranges looking for other vulnerable machines to exploit. <br><br>The entire foundation of <b>any</b> 6-years-past-end-of-life OS itself is essentially made of Swiss cheese , and no amount of security software is going to change that. <br><br>Sooner or later you *will* get hacked (there's quite a few botnets out there that automatically scan IP ranges for exploitable machines)<br><br>If a hacker can exploit a vulnerability, they can launch or install whatever program they want on your computer. The door has been left unlocked 6 years ago.<br>Anyway, many of these are not necessarily known virusses/malware, which means that they will have no problems getting them to run on your box no matter how many security programs you are running.<br>And even if your security software will detect and quarantine one malicious program that manages to get on, they may not be so lucky the next day. or the next day. or the next day.
