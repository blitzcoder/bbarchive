However, it looks like there are a whole bunch of versions:<br><br>The 'E', the 'S', 250Gb, 4GB, ...?<br>There seems to be a not insignificant price difference between the 4Gb and the 250GB, but... do you NEED that extra storage space for typical use? Can the 4GB still play all/most games, or is it really limiting to get that version?<br><br>(I do have a TV with HDMI, and both Wi-fi and ethernet available) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Most third party publishers are not keen to commit to the next gen consoles yet and are releasing on both (eg: X360 and XBone, PS3 and PS4) but I wouldn't expect to see a huge number of new releases after the end of this year. Things like Fifa and Madden which can be scaled back adequately might still come out on X360 and PS3 next year, and smaller publishers - particularly Japanese publishers will still be localizing existing PS3 games but Microsoft won't be keen for the X360 to be too well supported or people won't want to upgrade. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Now when it over heats it gives you a on screen warning, shuts down and wont let you restart until it's cooled down and now instead of a ring you get a red dot. And it wasn't just heating problems with the XBox 360, there was a issue with lead-free solder joints failing.<br><br>A google search will show loads of things related to the RROD and Red dot. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
