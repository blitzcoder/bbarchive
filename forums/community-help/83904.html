Re-partitioning your existing drive would include shrinking your existing data partition, which windows itself isn't very good at. You may need a (commercial) 3rd party tool like PartitionMagic to resize your current partition without dataloss.<br><br>Now, after you actually have the space for another partition, things will be easy: boot from your windows CD, and it will ask for the partition that you wish to install it in. windows will automatically detect equal or older versions, and set up a dual boot for you -- it will give a menu letting you pick which windows install to start. By default there's a 30-second countdown before it picks a default OS, but you can adjust that time from within windows.<br><br>(Installing an old version of windows on top of a new version won't work properly: it may not recognize the bootloader and write all over it, breaking the newer OS. So no installing windows XP after you already have Vista set up, but you can install vista on an existing XP system and have it work.) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

A lot of cheaper hardware didn't come with signed drivers to save a buck. Under Vista 64, it's signed drivers or nothing... So make sure to look at every component in your PC and make sure that it has 64 bit vista drivers: Motherboard, video card, sound card, network card, printer, scanner, webcam, *everything*. Don't just assume that it will work, because this was probably the biggest pitfall that many early adopters of 64 bit windows ran into.<br><br>Especially older, discontinued or low-end hardware likely won't have working 64 bit drivers. (almost everything made in the last couple of years does, although I haven't found any cheap TV tuner cards that can deal with 64 bit)<br><br>But: <i>as long as your hardware is supported</i>, 64 bit has been working a lot better than I had originally anticipated.<br><br>My computer can switch between three operating systems: XP 32 bit, Vista 64 bit and Linux 32 bit. I spend 99% of my time in Vista 64, the only thing I use XP 32 for is the rare occasions that I need to connect to our office network using the Cisco VPN client (which doesn't have a 64-bit client yet that's compatible with our router) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There is another option as well: Upgrade the entire system, to 64 bit as-is (unfortunately you can't do an in-place upgrade for 32-&gt;64, it requires a reinstall) and rather than dual boot into the 32-bit version, run it inside a virtual machine like virtualPC. that way you can always boot into the 64-bit OS, and for the rare instances you may wish 32-bit, you can  boot up the virtual PC.  (The downside of that is that it's slightly slower than running it natively, plus you don't really have your hardware 3D acceleration so it's not really suitable to run modern games under) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
