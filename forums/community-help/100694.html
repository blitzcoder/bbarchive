Not by choice but more because i see Blitz3d seems to have and will have more and more compatibility problems with windows 8 and the next windows OS.<br><br>I have followed some tutotials to learn more how Unity works and how to code.<br><br>At the moment i use this organisation :<br><br>-&gt;One scene with only one GameObject named "Master".<br>-&gt;One script named Main.js attached to Master, it will contain the main initialisation Start(), the main logic1 loop Update(), the main collision detection and response OnCollision(), the main logic2 loop FixedUpdate(), the main GUI commands OnGui()<br>-&gt;One script named G.js attached to Master, it will contain all global variables, all global entities (including the camera), all global arrays, all global functions (all the Blitz3d functions so that it simplifies the syntax that i have to type)<br>-&gt;One script for each kind of entity named Entity.js, for example for Player, the script will be named Player.js, for Bots, the script will be named Bot.js, for Rooms the script will be named Room.js.<br>Each entity script will contain all the variables, all the entities, all the arrays, all the functions concerning this kind.<br><br>I will create|modify|control|run|destroy all variables, all entities, all arrays, all functions from the Main.js.<br><br>To access|read|write a variable :<br>Bot.Name<br>Bot.Energy<br>Bot.Life<br><br>To access|position|rotate|turn|move an entity (GameObject) <br>Bot.Pivot<br>Bot.Mesh<br><br>To access|read|write a variable in an array :<br>Bot.Name[1]<br>Bot.Energy[1]<br>Bot.Life[1]<br><br>To access|run a function :<br>Bot.Sense()<br>Bot.Think()<br>Bot.Act()<br><br>I have seen that i can access other script and variables, entities, arrays, functions of other script by using 2 ways, either declaring all variables, entities, arrays, functions as static, or by declaring them as public and then retrieving the reference of the script. <br><br>So all seems to work as i want even if the syntax is a bit more complicated but if i can use Unity3d this way, this is good enough for me.<br><br>I don't understand how some programmers like to use one script attached to each entity, for a simple app|game, it may be easy enough to do that, but for a complex app|game, it must be really confusing to remember what script does what and to correct the errors.<br><br>My only worry at the moment is how i will be able to create|destroy a collider by code, how to retrieve the infos of a collision between 2 colliders, and if i will be able to reposition the collider at the right position without messing up the collision engine. This was my failure the last time. Anyway i will see how it goes.<br><br>If you use Unity3d and you like to create|control|destroy everything like with Blitz3d or with BlitzMax, how do you organise your stuff ?<br>I am curious.<br><br>Thanks, <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Once you get used to it you'll find it really is the much, much easier way to code.<br><br>Think of it this way: the script (the stuff-to-do for each entity) has a <i>de facto</i> existence whether you code it in or not, or the entity won't actually work. You can either attach it to the entity directly, or you can implicitly attach it to the by virtue of the fact that the control calls activate when you trawl through the confused mess of main update code; but the code exists and applies itself to the entity either way.<br><br>So why not reflect what's actually happening in your design, instead of writing "by implication" and just exposing the machinery rather than what you actually want to do?<br><br>It's got the huge advantage of focus: when you want to work on what an entity does, you can work on what an entity does and nothing else; and also of maintainability and expandability: you can use this focus to both mod existing entities and rapidly add whole new ones to the fray.<br><br>The reason it seems complicated <i>is because you're trying to use it like B3D</i>: B3D can't express a lot of these design patterns and therefore they seem complicated. The truth is that it's the other way around - maintaining a medium-large project in B3D is a <i>nightmare</i> because that same monolithic design you're looking at really makes it nearly impossible to keep your code organised once you pass the ~40KLoC barrier. I'd go so far as to say that this "style" is probably the single biggest reason nobody ever finishes anything in B3D.<br><br><br>If you want advice, here's what I would recommend doing, in order (this is a sequence of steps):<br><br>0) (step away from Unity for a week or so while steps 1-3 sink in, use other tools)<br><br>1) learn OOP. Understand polymorphism <i>fully</i>. Read and understand other object-oriented game architectures.<br><br>2) learn about and fully understand callbacks. Make sure to understand the difference between a function pointer, a callback, a delegate and a closure, and how one can be used to build the others. Read up on introductory FP. Make sure you fully understand <i>functions as values</i> (something alien to BASIC)<br><br>3) learn JavaScript <i>properly</i>. JavaScript is a subtle and powerful language and learning to program in B3D will <i>not</i> have helped you master it to any significant degree. JavaScript is nothing like B3D, nor for that matter is it anything like BlitzMax, Java or C. (It's closest to a mix between Scheme and Self.) You need to understand JavaScript's prototype-based object model and its function-objects at the very least.<br><br>4) armed with a proper understanding of JavaScript, go back and architect your Unity program according to the Unity JS tutorials; you should by this point be able to take advantage of the structure they designed e engine for and will enjoy using it a whole lot more.<br><br><br>TL;DR: the JavaScript way is objectively superior to the B3D way, there is a reason why people use it; if you use the B3D way you will be ignoring most of the power of JS and by extension Unity; learn to use the tool in the way it was designed; do not assume that JS is as weak a language as B3D, or that they B3D design is any good, just because that's the way you know how to code at the moment.<br><br><br>I'm sorry that came off as my usual arrogant and didactic rant but the big problem here is that you are engaging in the classic Paul Graham "blub paradox": assuming that the way you code now in a weak and unstructured language is the right way to code everywhere and therefore ignoring the much better ways to code opened up by much more powerful languages, instead assuming they are worse because they aren't receptive to your less powerful coding style.<br><br>I should also point out again tht this is mostly a JS vs. B3D issue, and the fact that you're using Unity is mainly relevant in that Unity can be used from JS. (It is a legitimate problem that people act like JS is suitable for beginners and artist when it clearly isn't, but that's another story.)<br><br><br>Alternatively, don't use the complicated language that is JavaScript, and instead stick to the comparatively simple language option that is C#: this is closer to what you know, uses a much less alien object model, and should make it much more obvious how all of these things work after about step 2 on the above list. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So if you ask me to type a long instruction only to read a variable, i will have difficulties to understand how it is more efficient. More stylish maybe.<br><br>But you are probably right, my mind has so been shaped by the Blitz3d coding way that now i can't grasp the advantages of others langages.<br>However this does not change my goal : to make a game.<br><br>I guess each one has his preferences. <br>And maybe if i keep reading and using this langage, after some time i will effortlessly be converted to this new way of coding. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
