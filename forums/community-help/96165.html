Yeah, they love 'Wish you were here' if you can sing and play, which I can just about do, I use backing tracks from <a href="http://www.guitarbackingtrack.com" target="_blank">http://www.guitarbackingtrack.com</a>, some of the songs include the vocals :P <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I originally (about 6 years ago or more) got the acoustic basics down from here:  <a href="http://www.easyguitarnet.com/" target="_blank">http://www.easyguitarnet.com/</a><br><br>Moved onto electric a couple of years ago as I needed something loud enough to play over my sons drum kit :)  I've got a great pal who's an absolute guitar master and we've been looking at blues-y stuff recently.  But electric isn't where my heart is atm; it's acoustic playing and singing.  This weekend we had a stack of his gear (mixing desk, studio monitors, mics, vocal fx stomp board, electric + acoustic guitars, laptop / cubase) all set up in my living room (oh, as well as the real drum kit, bass guitar and 3/4 electric for my daughter that always live in there :D)<br><br>I've not played publicly yet, but a guy that does a regular set in a pub in town challenged me to get a couple of songs down and get up and do them and I'm close to taking him up on that offer. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That's just a lack of experience though. I do play to my friends, wait, that sounds wierd, my friends ask me to play so I do :D but it can't be anything like the buzz of playing to a crowd who would be cheering and clapping :P<br><br>I say go for it and have that experience. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
