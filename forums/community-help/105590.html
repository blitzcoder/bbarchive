The matter of smoothing group (and UV seams) is not due to the structur of the smoothing groups, but only due to the way it needs to compute more vertices for the seams.<br><br>Conclusion :<br>More surfaces = more draw call = more CG synchronization = more rendering time.<br>More vertices = more rendering time. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Shaders can also add differences as does the 3d engine. Also materials can mean a lot of different things. You could have a single materials that uses uv to select the current maps and vertex colours to select the colours. in that situation the document becomes of less use.<br><br>You also have to consider the 3d pipeline you are using. older pipelines are slower but a bit more forgiving. you are basically throwing lots of commands at the gpu. E.G. for each shape you are sending gpu data for each vertex, etc.<br><br>Modern 3d moves from the base triangles and strips to batch processing. You setup as much of the data as possible beforehand. and with a single gpu command send all the data to the cpu in one go. Because the connection between the cpu and memory is much faster it is considered a single command and many times faster. But the strips still exist.<br><br>Moving further we are now moving into a new phase of 3d where all the above is combined and processed. The entire 3d scene is transferred and locally held and only the changes updated. It;s a bit of a brain crunch to get your head around.<br><br>The best way to think about it, it not to. Do what you have always done until you find there is a bottleneck. then work out if it is the model or the 3d renderer. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
