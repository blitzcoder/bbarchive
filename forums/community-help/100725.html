Is that inclusive? Shouldn;t there at least be a 'to' in there somewhere?<br><br>I've heard American police officers talk of how a man was "burglarized" and could only assume that this was the moment one turns to crime.<br><br>Do people actually rest in restrooms? Admittedly, there's not always a bath in a bathroom<br><br>I was supposed to meet an American friend once, they hadn't shown up at the appointed time, so I called them on the 'phone, and they told me they were "waiting on a train". Although I was disappointed that they would be late, I was glad to hear they had what sounded like a nice job.<br><br>In the 'States, one can have their house "weatherized" at a cost. In England, we have weather (and lots of it!) for free.<br><br>I used to smoke (I quit about 9 months ago now, so doing well!) but it wasn't until I was in the company of some American friends that I realised just how often and easily I would say "I'm just going to nip out for a fag", and how, even after weeks, they weren't so used to hearing such a phrase.<br><br>In true response to the OP, regarding dumbing down, there was an actual decision for the United States, in seeking and attaining independence, that they would have a simple (as in easy, not stupid ;) ) language. It's true that English has possibly got far too many words, even. This is also why 'z' (Zed, not Zee!)replaced 's' and 'u' was dropped and other such 'foibles' introduced into the language the Americans use.<br><br>One thing I've often found more curious than annoying is that 'jerk' (short for 'jerk-off' which can again be short for 'one that jerks off' where jerk is a verb synonymous with performing an act of physical, sexual onanism - Is extremely common in the United States, (and has spread well thanks to TV and movies :) ) despite it's crude connotations, there doesn't seem to be any problems with it and web  forums with word filters (Waste of time, really) that filter such words as "gay", "idiot" and "bitch" for some reason, are not at all configured to bother with "jerk"s.<br>What really suprises me, though, is that, as being from the UK where the word w*nker is really one of those swear words that you just can't say in polite conversation (at least, not polite enough to still say sh1t, bl0ody etc.). It's just not nice. Maybe the British (That's English, Scottish, Welsh, the populations of Isle Of Man, those crown dependencies now considered BOT and Gibraltar etc.) are just more prudish, but then we do seem to say "Bugger" a lot more than I believe Americans do, and this is used almost as carefreely as "jerk" is by the Americans, despite it's meaning...<br><br>There's definitely a lot of horrible atrocities on language, not just English, but possibly every language (except perhaps French... Internet and slang Francais seems to be extremely long winded with properly spelled words that I have seen!) that has become a staple of the internet in some of its less refined 'corners'. ;)<br>I don't know whether some of these are just convenience/laziness or that sort of "on-purpose mockery" such as "pwnage" (I refer here to the use of 'p' as a purposeful mistyping of 'o'. There's no excuses for silly words like "ownage"!)<br><br>Speaking of which, the word "own" in that sense actually comes from assumed prison slang adopted by some to imply someone's sexual plaything. Really not very nice is it? Now there's children as young as ten, possibly younger using it in every day speech.<br>The same can be said for "sucks" or "blows" equivalently both of which implies fellatio but apparently as a bad thing.<br><br>I will admit, those words have been bastardised and bandied around much longer than the internet and I'm sure there'll be more to come... <br><br><br>{I posted the same David Mitchell YouTube Link because I didn't realise Yan already linked it!}<br>____<br><br>But.. having said all the above, and mostly it was tongue in cheek and hopefully more amusing than offending anyone - I'm much more tolerant and leess caring nowadays. We live in times of global communication, where US English is extremely common, albeit smattered with a bunch (see what I did there?) of words from German, Korean and even Afrikaans as a result of popular cuoltural influence on the web - Perhaps in the future, the global language will be a bizarre digital-age Esperanto rendition of 'textspeak' combining languages of India, China, English and wherever else!<br>About ten years ago now, I was working in a Further Ed College, and read an interesting article in the TES written by some top professor of "English Language" at Oxford who basically praised the evolution of language that was apparent with "Text-Speak" and the shorthand used because<br>it represented more efficient and widely understood communication.<br><br>Although I still had my doubts about it, thinking that the core of English had to be learned properly (i.e. one needs to know the difference/meaning of too, to or two before being able to properly understand the context of "2" in a phrase such as "Gon 2 wrk. pub 2. bbl" ("[I've]Gone to work, [then the] pub too. [I'll] be back later.") ) - yet at least, this lady's article did open my eyes somewhat and I can appreciate at least, that language really isn't (and shouldn't be) a static thing. Not only are words being invented and unuse all the time, but the very structure and method of communication too. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

"English" is not being dumbed down as long as my private copy of the language is kept properly maintained. I don't much care for anyone else's version; I don't use most of those. If you want your own version to spread and become popular (/again), write something worth reading and repeating, and lead by example. You can't very well enforce rules with no obvious justifications.
