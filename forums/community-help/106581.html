I thought that MiniB3D was purely DX based so wouldn't work cross platforms(I favor Android and Windows as they are most widely spread), that's why I was thinking about the OpenGL/DX that Irrlicht apparently supports given what they mention int the docs:<br><div class="quote"> <br>The Irrlicht Engine supports 5 rendering APIs, which are 4 more than most other 3D engines do:<br>•Direct3D 9.0<br>•OpenGL 1.2-4.x<br>•The Irrlicht Engine software renderer.<br>•The Burningsvideo Software Renderer<br>•A null device.<br><br>When using the Irrlicht engine, the programmer needs not know, which API the engine is using, it is totally abstracted. He only needs to tell the engine which API the engine should prefer.<br> There are three reasons why the engine not only focuses on one API:<br>•Performance. Some graphic adapters are optimized for OpenGL, some simply run faster with Direct3D.<br>•Platform independence. Direct3D will not be present on a Mac or a Linux Workstation, while maybe OpenGL will. And when OpenGL is not available either, there are still the Irrlicht Engine software renderers, which will always operate on any platform. In this way, the user will see something on the screen for sure.<br>•Driver problems, which are a common problem a user encounters when using 3D software. There are thousands of hardware configurations out there, and often games and 3D applications are crashing, because there is an old driver installed. Letting the user switch the driver might solve the problem.<br><br>[cut..]<br><br>The Irrlicht Engine is platform independent, currently there is official support for:<br>•XP, XP64, Vista, CE, Windows 7,Windows 8 and Windows 10<br>•Linux<br>•OSX<br>•Sun Solaris/SPARC<br>•All platforms using SDL<br><br>For the serious mobile developer there are work-in-progress OpenGL ES drivers, which have enabled the Irrlicht community to develop iPhone, Android and Nokia Symbian ports. The Engine works with all supported platforms in the same way. The programmer only has to write the game/application code once, and it will run on all supported platforms without the need to change one single line of code.<br> <br></div><br><br><br>@meems<br>Couple of questions to consider:<br>1) What Windows and BlitzPlus version are you using, are they fully updated and what path is your BlitzPlus installed to?<br>2) Also what DX do you have installed? (type DXDiag.exe at a CMD or search window - dunno how to check OpenGL versions though).<br>3) What GFX card do you have, does it support DX and OpenGL and which versions?<br><br>Afaik you really shouldn't have to copy DLL's around, with me it compiles &amp; runs the examples using F5 right away, no hassle at all, but then again I'm currently using Blitz3d and I do have quite a number of other decls/dll's in my Blitz3d already.<br><br>Like a year ago I also tested it on BlitzPlus though and all was fine. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
