Only problem was the didn't have collision detection at all. So i googled around for a powerfull 3D engine that can be used by an easy programming language, nothing to complex yet like C++. And i found this i google some videos to see what this software could do and it was pretty impressive. Now i have some questions and i hope you people can answer then.<br><br>Question 1<br>What software should i use?<br>BlitzMax or Blitz3D (left the others out because i thought they aren't that powerfull).<br>I focus to create games for windows so OpenGl isn't really needed i also saw that OpenGL for BlitzMax used some low level stuff and it doesn't include a collision engine.<br><br>Question 2<br>Should i buy the Blitz3D programming manual?<br>I saw that the Manual was added on august 30 2006.<br>That is a long time ago when was the last update for Blitz3D.<br>Is the manual missing some new features?<br><br>Question 3<br>What OpenGl version does BlitzMax use?<br>And what DirectX version does Blitz3D use?<br>I saw topic on the internet that Blitz3D used DirectX 7, but that topic was 7 years old.<br><br>Question 4<br>Difference between Blitz3D demo and bought version.<br>So what is the difference apart from acces to some places on this website and the 5 seconds timer when starting up the software? Are some features gone? Are you allowed to sell your games commercially with the demo version?<br><br>Question 5<br>Is multiplayer possible?<br>Simple question can you create a multiplayer game?<br><br>Question 6<br>How realistic is Blitz3D?<br>Is it possible to create something like this?<br>Screenshot:<br><img src="http://gamegpu.ru/images/remote/http--www.gamegpu.ru-images-stories-Test_GPU-Action-GTA_IV_Real_Graphics_Mod-game_4.jpg"><br>Things like realtime shadows high poly models, god rays.<br>Can the software handle this?<br><br>Question 7<br>How hard is it to learn BlitzMax and/or Blitz3D?<br>How long will this take?<br><br>For now thats all, thank you very much for reading this and i hope you could anwer some questions.<br>(Note: This is written on my mobile, and my first language isn't english.)<br>~fishrod <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It doesn't contain anything you won't find in the bundled help files or on this website. It's mainly just for people who really like to have a physical paper book in their hands.<br><br>3: BlitzMax is rather flexible and isn't tied to one OpenGL version, although using others requires some wizardry. The miniB3D 3D engine is OpenGL 1.5, I think.<br>Blitz3D still uses DirectX 7. This may potentially be an issue on modern Windows (I don't know - it works for me, but most people here reckon it's not tenable on Windows 8)<br>You will see references to one or more "replacement engines" on these forums ("hardwired" is the current popular one), but those are third-party plugins and not really part of Blitz3D itself. How well they work and how available they are varies immensely.<br><br>4: You can sell programs made with the full version. They contain no DRM and have no limitations.<br>There are a few features that have been added since the demo. The most important ones are cubemaps (needed for things like reflective water) and the native .B3D format for meshes, which is basically the only decent mesh format for the engine (.3DS and .MD2 are a bit useless in reality).<br><br>5: Yup. There are many libraries and examples in the code archives, this is no problem.<br><br>6: ....eeeehhhh.<br><br>Blitz3D can... just about struggle its way to display images of that quality, I guess. But you need to understand that the important thing in that scene is not the engine - it's the quality of the 3D models and textures and all the other art assets that were crafted <i>for</i> the engine. You could whack those beautiful Rockstar art assets into basically any engine and it'd look fantastic, but that's because they spent a hundred million dollars on 'em. Yes, given GTA quality models, Blitz3D could make a game that looks nearly as good as GTA... but Blitz3D isn't the bottleneck in this problem; getting art that looks <i>that</i> good is.<br><br>Blitz3D has access to a small range of "prefab" tools (fog, lighting, etc.), and with the right libraries and plugins you can extend this with a few more conventional prefabs like DoF and godrays and so on. What you <i>can't</i> do in Blitz3D is wacky, completely original graphical effects, because it has no access to the programmable ("shader") pipeline - you're stuck with whatever pre-baked effects DirectX 7 offers. You can do reflections and shadows (at some performance cost), but you can't create the next Okami, building worlds out of the negative space created by swirling ink clouds or whatever.<br><br><br>Question 7 isn't a question anyone can easily answer for you. Some people pick this stuff up in days. Some people never learn. You'll have to give the demo a spin and see what happens. You can also use BlitzPlus to get a feel for the language, which is completely free even for commercial use now.<br><br><br>I don't want to discourage you (and I don't want to rob BRL of a sale)... but TBH I think Blitz3D's day is done. You should really consider a more modern engine. There are several other easy languages out there (Lua, Python, etc.) with much newer and more powerful engines attached to them. For a similar price to Blitz3D, you could get the Lua version of Leadwerks and get the massive power of OpenGL 4, Steam integration, Mac and Linux support, etc., as well as a language that's in a lot of ways a modernised BASIC (and much faster). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
