Never anything major, just sort of like the last save didn't work (even though it did, because I ran the app!).<br><br>It happened big time an hour ago when we had a power spike or something, the computer reset and the file I had been working on (and saving and running etc) had reverted back about an hour!<br><br>So far, this has only affect my USB HD - but that could be because that's all I really use. Caching is turned OFF for the USB HD so I can fast-remove it.<br><br>Could this be something to do with system restore? File system virtualization?<br><br>There are a few references to similar problems on the 'net, but no real solutions/answers.<br><br>Whatever it is, it's starting to get pretty unnerving! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Run a complete chkdsk /f /v on the drive in question.  What USB HD?  (Brand, size, SSD?)<br><br>2.  What editor are you using?  What version?<br><br>3.  Is this a native install of win 7, or virtual machine?  Which version of Win 7, 32 or 64 bit, home, basic, premium, server, home server?<br><br>4.  What "versioning (cvs)" software are you running, if any?<br><br>5.  How long have you been awake?  Make sure your in office cohorts aren't playing tricks on you with networking, vnc, etc...  (LOL, ok this is just for fun.)<br><br>6.  Are you running Blitzmax/editor from the usb HD, or local?<br><br>7.  What anti-virus software are you running?<br><br>8.  Do you have this problem on any other USB drive, or just this one in particular?<br><br>9.  Desktop/Notebook/other?  Brand?  Chipset?  What drive?<br><br>10.  NTFS or FAT?  Primary partition or other on the device?  Have you checked the file security on the drive, directory, and all files?<br><br>To me this implies a HD cache problem.  You may not have caching turned on in windows, but the HD still has it's own internal interface with caching, and you can't access these settings on the drive directly.<br><br>I'd recommend you discontinue the use of that particular USB HD and try another, from a different manufacturer until your sure it's not the USB HD in question.  Can you then duplicate these problems?  If so it's some other hardware issue, or software issue.<br><br>Let's us know soon. :D<br><br>P.S.  Why no UPS on your system??? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
