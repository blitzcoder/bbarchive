Still, it's fairly interesting to a math geek.<br><br>I never thought about looking directly at a binary number for factors. But I can see some possibilities.<br><br>In base ten the easy rules are derived from two ideas. First, 10 = 2*5 means you check for divisibility by 2,5 just by looking at the last digit. Likewise you can check for divisibility by 4,25 using last two digits, by 8,125 with last three etc. <br><br>The second idea is for numbers which are +1 or -1 base ten. The fact that 10 is +1 mod 9 means that 10^2, 10^3 etc. are all 1 mod 9. As a result a number is congruent mod 9 to the sum of the digits. This process can be repeated. Example: for 32718 we add digits to get 21, then again to get 3. This means 32718 is congruent to 3 mod 9 and thus not divible by 9.<br><br>Likewise 11 - 1 = 10 gives a test for divisibility by 11. We note that 10 is -1 mod 11. From that we know 10^2 is (-1)^2, or 1. 10^3 is -1, 10^4 is +1 and so on. So a number can be reduced by the sum of digits method, but alternating + and -, starting with the rightmost digit.<br><br>Example: For 76208 we have 8 - 0 + 2 - 6 + 7 = 11 and then 1 - 1 = 0.<br>Thus 76208 is 0 mod 11 and is divisible by 11.<br><br>The same tricks will work in binary, although a maximum digit of 1 doesn't provide much leeway. But you can use pairs of bits and consider the number as base 4, or triples of bits for base 8 etc.<br><br>With pairs of bits, base 4, we then get rules for 3,5. Triples are base 8 so we can do 7,9. The practical limit for human readability is probably blocks of four, which is base 16 and we get rules for 15,17. These are all analogous to the 9,11 rules for base 10.<br><br>Example: n = 110101101. Let's group pairs of bits 1 10 10 11 01. These give base four digits of 1 2 2 3 1. To reduce mod 5, remembering that 5 is -1 mod 4, we calculate<br><br>1 - 3 + 2 - 2 + 1 = -1. So n is congruent to -1 mod 5 and not divible by 5.<br><br>As a reality check n = 110101101 is 429 in base 10. This is congruent to 9 mod 5, and 9 - 10 = -1 so n is also congruent to -1 mod 5.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2010</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This is because 10^n is one more than 999...9 (the number whose digits are n nines).<br><br>Further, the remainder when you divide 2*10^n by 3 is 2, because 2*99...99 is 199...98, and 2*10^n is two more than that. The remainder on dividing 3*10^n by 3 is 0 because it's a multiple of 3, and dividing 4*10^n by 3 leaves remainder 1 again, and so it carries on.<br><br>For brevity, the remainder when you divide <i>a</i> by <i>b</i> is called 'a (<i>modulo</i> b)'. <br><br>b divides a only when a = 0 (modulo b), which is the same as saying there's no remainder when you divide a by b. (Fact 1)<br><br>So we've shown that for any whole number <i>d</i>, d*10^n == d (modulo 3). (Fact 2)<br><br>So let's say we've got a whole number <i>i</i> whose digits are (reading right to left) d0,d1,d2, ... ,dm.<br><br>Then,<br>i = d0 + d1*10 + d2*10^2 + d3*10^3 + ... + dm*10^m<br><br>but by Fact 2,<br>i = d0 + d1 + d2 + d3 + ... + dm (modulo 3).<br><br><br>Notice that the right hand side of that equation is the sum of the digits of <i>i</i>, which I'll call <i>s</i>.<br><br>So, by Fact 1: if <i>s</i>, the sum of the digits, is divisible by 3, then s=0 (mod 3). But i = s (mod 3), so i = 0 (mod 3). Which means that <i>i</i> is divisible by 3! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
