A lot of times the specifications look OK, but you won't know for sure how well it actually works and how reliable it is until you've used one. I'd recommend you try looking up some online reviews on Colombian websites -- it's small things that can really make a device either great or horrible -- for example: bad battery life or really bad touchscreen accuracy can ruin an otherwise pretty good device. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
