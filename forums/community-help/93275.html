Although the features are not really NextGen and as a plain vanilla Blitz3D compiled thing it must be declared as DX7ish, the games are fully playable and with some good level design they may be nice, especially for people who want to play games on older hardware.<br><br>I am currently preparing the addition of ODE physics, as well as optional Shadow mapping, optional FastExt postprocessors, and some glitches will be fixed (eg. lip-async bugs in NPC conversation mode).<br><br>When I watched some game construction kits lately then I realized they aren't that much better, in the end of the day they all are cooking with water. They may have some nice additional features like shaders and LOD systems etc. but basicly what makes them really sexy is the GUI. When I used to read in their docs it turned out most stuff you can do there is trivial, in my option not worth a GUI, a simple txt file could handle it. Such polished GUIs are however state of the art, so this is the reason why I decided to search for somebody who is familar with GUI design and who wants to create something for my game engine. The engine can be downloaded for free and all file formats are exlpained in the docs, so it should be easy to make a GUI for it (it means: union of level editor, waypoint recorder, various config files management/wrapping). I will also answer any further questions.<br>The goal, besides a hot GUI design, is intuitive and fast level design, deeply nested and/or hidden menus should be avoided. Tool tips and context help etc. is welcome, all the things that make somebody say WOW when he realizes that something is really userfriedly. Watch these two GUIs to get an idea of what I am after:<br><br><a href="http://unity3d.com/unity/editor/" target="_blank">http://unity3d.com/unity/editor/</a><br><a href="http://stonetrip.com/shiva-editor.html" target="_blank">http://stonetrip.com/shiva-editor.html</a><br>(Note I do not want a WinAPI Gui/Menu etc.)<br><br>I won't deny, the Level editor and the other tools that are part of the original Game Construction Kit today, they are very poor. This ok for me, I don't need a teaser, but other people stay away when they see the ultraslim GUI and so on.<br><br>So, if you want to take a closer look, go to my site and play the game, also try the construction kit and read the docs.<br><br>I cannot pay any money for this, but you could sell it, or release free and advanced versions, or whatever you like. The Product would however be presented on the Engine Homepage - at least if it isn't worse than the free, original editor. Please note, this is something for somebody who is really good in GUI design. Don't spend your time when you're not really good in this field.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, I am not searching for somebody to do my work for free. I only know that I am not very good when it comes to GUI design. If I won't find anybody to create a nice GUI for it, I most likely will have to do it by my own the sooner or later. But I definitely would prefere some kind of Coproduction.<br><br>Thanks for your  attention.<br><br>See also the presentation of the latest release with extra info:<br><a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=92710#1066975" target="_blank">http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=92710#1066975</a><br>and of course the project page:<br><a href="http://www.melog.ch" target="_blank">http://www.melog.ch</a><br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
