I tried out a few of the games and my computer got a virus. A Windows Protection thing popped up and started scanning. I'd never seen it before in my life so I opened up my ZoneAlarm virus scanner and started scanning. Both my scanner and the other scanner were scanning and were seeing viruses and trojans. ZoneAlarm kept popping up a message that some weird named program was wanting to run so I kept pressing the Deny button. After I restarted my computer, it goes to the desktop but there are no icons or taskbar. There is only the desktop image and the cursor. Ctrl+Alt+Delete doesn't do anything. I've tried running in Safe Mode and it won't let me. I can't use the Windows XP disc to repair anything because it gives me Blue Screen Of Death. Does anyone know how I can fix this? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It comes bundled with spybot, some antivirus tools, etc. but you can also run others from a flashdrive or something (flashdrive may need to be plugged in upon booting for it to recognize it properly, plug-and-play is a bit flakey)<br><br>Alternatively, you can download Ubuntu 9.04 and boot from that CD. In addition to installing the OS on your harddrive, you also have the 'LiveCD' option where you can run it straight from CD, without touching your drive...

So I started using a neat folder system. There are folders for things like, Games, Internet, Instant Messaging, Music and Video, etc. Those had things like Shortcuts in them. It made it a lot easier for me. This time around I'll be putting the games that I can install, into "C:/Games" instead of "C:/Program Files".<br><br>Also not long ago, I decided to back up some of my files on CD.
