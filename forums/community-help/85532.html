REaly easy to snap off part of the plastic too.<br><br>Pretty much all laptop vendors replace the entire keyboard if there's a problem with even a single key since it's really not a serviceable part.<br>(Typically you need to dis-assemble the entire laptop case, after which you can take out the keyboard and replace it with a different one. Obviously the keyboard is unique to each vendor, so you'll have to talk to your laptop manufacturer for a replacement model.<br>Most likely they're going to be ridiculously expensive, though... you may wish to look around ebay for an identical laptop. You can often pick up dead laptops real cheap, and there's a good chance that it still has a functional keyboard that you can harvest. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Fluids in your computer can cause shortcuts, wich is normally not a real problem with a keyboard in most cases because that will simulate some keys being pressed all the time.<br><br>But if there are some fluids on the mainboard of the notebook, wich is beneath the keyboard there is a chance you can kill it when there is power running through it.<br><br>So if possible dissasemble the notebook and let the other parts dry a bit as well if needed before using it again.<br><br>Don't do any of these things if you have an insurance for your notebook for cases like this, warranty will never cover stuff like this. Also be sure what your doing when opening a notebook, you can easily break something.<br>Safest option is always to let the hardware vendor fix it, but mostly this is not the cheapest option. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I have not had that problem with the times i have done it(a dell and a siemens), perhaps it depends on what type of alcohol you use. Methys have always done the job for me. Failing that a new keyboard from the manufacturers parts dept would cost not a lot (15-20 quid tops).<br><br>@uber most warranties will be voided from liquid damage, i know dell's and HP's are. Unless you purchaced some kind of buyer protection insurance.<br><br>Hehe i used WD40 once in a normal keyboard when the keys started sticking due to beer damage. It worked a treat and is non conductive (so can be used immediately) although it is HIGHLY flamable (at least alc evaporates) so wouldnt reccommend it for a LT keyboard :) in fact i wouldnt reccomend it full stop, but it does work :D <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Didn't even open them, just let them get completely soaked in water.<br><br>Electronics doesn't get damaged from water or moisture, unless it has electricity. So let the keyboard then dry for 3-4 weeks before you use it. I wouldn't bath the whole laptop though, but just the keyboard. It can be usually removed quite easily by removing a few screws. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That must've been the toughest laptop out there at the time. I spilt a whole quart of sugar-saturated tea on the keyboard. The bottom of the screen changed brightness a little, but not noticeably. Aside from that, no damage at all. That laptop lasted me 6 years, all the paint around the touchpad and a few of the keycaps wore off, by the time it stopped working.<br><br>The hinges on the screen were cracked, one of them got fixed in time with a little Gorilla Glue, the other I didn't get to in time. Now that I think of it, I bet the problem that finally broke it was that the CMOS battery had worn out. Meh. It was starting to get pretty obsolete anyway.<br><br>Funny thing is, it wasn't really marketed for durability, but it was tough as nails. My new laptop's power cord socket broke off within a month. The manufacturer said it was a common thing to happen, and fixed it for me. Still, a pretty big difference. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
