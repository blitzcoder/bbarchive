What some people would refer to as an update,which is what I was promised in writing published on the internet and sent to my e-mail address saying as much. I'm right they are wrong. but nothing I can do I guess. I thought maybe there might be some kind of better business type of thing where I could at least file a complaint.

Had emailed the contact link with no response for several days.  Turns out that the guy running the site was on vacation and hadn't checked on his email in a week.  He had no idea that the site wasn't emailing the download link like it should.<br><br>I'm thinking the guy who created Awesome animator isn't actively trying to rip people off, probably someone who lost interest in the product and left his website on automatic.
