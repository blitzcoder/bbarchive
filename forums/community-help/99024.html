But it got me thinking. I've had countless LCD displays over the years, game consoles, phones, tablets, laptops, monitors, TVs, digital picture frames, etc. I've only ever had 1 or 2 dead pixels across all of that. Of all the people I've ever setup systems for I've only ever seen 2 more screens with dead pixels. None of my friends or relatives has ever had a dead pixel... Am I living in a fantasy world where dead pixels are like dead unicorns (pretty in their own way, but still a mess to clean up), or have I just been EXTREMELY lucky?<br><br>Thoughts, experiences, scientific data? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Always have a bright red glowing dot in the center of the screen, which is very distracting, especially if you're watching a movie with dark scenes. From time to time a green one would pop up close by, but it would go away for a while after flicking it. Nothing would make the red one go away.<br><br>At the office, I've seen maybe two screen with dead pixels, out of 300+. It's more common for the entire backlight itself to give out.<br><br>As time progressed, so have the warranties. Some manufacturers no give a zero dead pixel warranty, although most of them still consider 1-6 dead pixels to be 'normal', and ineligible for exchange/return. In those cases, buying the screen from a department store with liberal return policy may be a smarter move than saving a few bucks and ordering online.<br><br>A couple of years back, some manufactueres small print would say that 2-3 *dozen* pixels was considered 'normal' and not grounds for exchange. That number has definitely come down since production standards improved.<br><br><br>Something else to remember: There really aren't that many different manufacturing plants for display panels in the world. This is one of those areas where it can pay off to stay with the big name brands like Samsung, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Sony, etc, because a lot of the panels that may not pass their initial quality control could still be picked up for next to nothing by some of the no-name low-end cheap LCD companies. Going with those can greatly increase the risk of problematic panels. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
