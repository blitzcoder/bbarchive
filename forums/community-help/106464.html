I will definitely want an optical drive. I often rip audio CDs from collector's editions of games. I suppose I could do it on my laptop but that thing is hardly ever set up.<br><br>The MSI mobo does indeed have a gigabit Ethernet port and some fancy software to make the most of it. I've got a Steam Link that I'll be using to game in the lounge too so I'll definitely be using LAN for everything I can. So I guess I probably don't need wifi, but since it's about £20, I figured it was worth having just in case I need to work somewhere where Ethernet isn't practical.<br><br>I'm not sure what you meant about my GPU choice. The MSI GTX 1080s are virtually silent, so I've read. You're probably right about the case fans. Fan noise doesn't bother me but having a silent GPU cooling system and then having noisy case fans is probably a bit stupid. I think they have blue LEDs too which will clash with the red on motherboard and GPU. So I should probably replace them with a pair of Corsair Red AF120s. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

No fancy-cooling-solutions used here or in computers of friends.
