Originally another fella was going to do it,<br>let's call him 'Mr. Programmer', and was going to charge the owner, Ruben,<br>$400.<br><br>I said I'd do it for $75 and got the job. However, Mr. Programmer and his<br>weasily boss, who we shall call Joe, weren't too happy about it and refused<br>to give me access to the domain name so that I could upload the site<br>I'd built.<br><br>After much finangling, I managed to get the access codes to Ruben's<br>Godaddy.com account from Joe and Mr. Programmer, so now I and Ruben<br>have control over the domain name, Vivasabor.com.<br><br>However, it is still being hosted by Joe, which Ruben is not happy with,<br>since Joe is holding it over his head that he's hosting the website for free.<br><br>Anyways, to cut to the point, this morning I signed Ruben up with a year<br>of hosting at godaddy.com, so that Joe and his Programmer no longer have<br>any control over the site, but I need a way to block them from accessing it, since they still can.<br><br>So my questions are thus:<br><br>1. I need to block Mr. Programmer and Joe from being able to access the<br>website, so that I and Ruben are the only one who can make edits. How do<br>I do this?<br><br>I suspect it has to do with the DNS, but I'm not sure. I just want to lock<br>the Domain Name to the Godaddy Host, so that it can't be hosted or accessed<br>from anywhere else.<br><br>2. How would they currently be accessing the site? Via FTP?<br><br><br>My request may sound harsh, but circumstances call for it :)<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Jose Ruiz <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This includes login passwords, ftp passwords, email passwords, security questions if any, primary and secondary email addresses etc - any of which could be used to regain entry if you aren't careful.<br><br>[edit] Oh, and don't take this the wrong way... a few weeks ago somebody approached me to build them an e-commerce website.  They asked me because word's got around that I've done websites in the past (which amounts to a bit of HTML, PHP/MySQL and CSS).  There is no way in hell that I consider myself qualified enough to take the gig, so I politely turned it down as I'd be out of my depth from the outset.<br><br>Just something to think about.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I understand where Darkheart is coming from as well. I've been in the Ecommerce business for 6 years from customer support to development and personally see how quickly the client switches on you when they have a site in mind. They tend to get hotheaded when you don't produce the good they want. Also nowadays some clients are quite clued up, so apart from website, they would like you to employ some search engine optimisation. Most web designer provide good readable content which search engines loves, , eg not having the whole site in flash ;-)<br><br>Whatever you do, Good luck with it WERDNA, but I just want to say Darkheart does have a good point<br><br>Kind Regards <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Wordpress definitely looks worthwhile. <br></div><br><br>Wordpress is the best thing since sliced bread when it comes to building websites of average complexity - and almost everything that is not a full blown eCommerce website like Amazon falls into that category. For example, at my company, we run our internal technical knowledge base on an Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Wordpress server.<br><br>Wordpress is a solid foundation and it can be customized until Kingdom Come with plugins and themes. But, as always, it's worth nothing if you don't understand the basics of the underlying technologies and platforms.<br><br>When you're serious about all that web stuff, José, you should learn how to use a Unix platform, Apache, MySQL, FTP, DNS, SSH, SCP, the IP protocol, you have to understand the difference between clients and servers and client-side and server-side code, how some common Internet protocols work and it won't hurt you if you can at least read PHP, HTML, JavaScript and the like. <br><br>Just being able to use the basic features of Dreamweaver or another HTML editor just isn't enough - but it's a mistake that most people make when they smell easy money in the web "design" business. There's a LOT to learn and there's a LOT of work that your customers just don't see and accordingly don't want to pay for.<br><br>And to add insult to injury, you also need to have TASTE and an eye for aesthetics - most people, especially programmers, just don't have that and will only come up with results that cause eye cancer. To underline this with the most popular example: Taste, an eye for aesthetics and love for detail are --THE-- things that distinguish Apple from the rest of the entire IT industry, it has NOTHING to do with technology. And you either have that or you don't. These things are nothing that anybody can actually learn. To use another metaphor, like any other craft, you can learn how to draw and paint or play an instrument, at least for the most part, but you cannot be taught how to create - and recognize - something beautiful. There are no algorithms for that, and that area of expertise is not binary and cannot be mathematically explained. If you don't feel that difference inside you, then all you will ever do will at best be mediocre. But, as Microsoft has proven throughout its entire existence, mediocrity can still make you extraordinarily wealthy. As the former boss of a huge German TV station once said about the quality of his programme: "You cannot drown in shallow waters." <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
