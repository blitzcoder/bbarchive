That's the only important aspect of it. All it means is a more detailed picture, same as resolution on PC. Think back to every time you got a new PC monitor. There are always some luddites who think you can and therefore should use a PC at 800x600 (shock! horror! that's not even widescreen!), but nobody listens to them either.<br><br>DVDs are digital and will be in the resolution they were made at, so some oddness may occur when the image gets scaled to the bigger display resolution. Cassettes... I think are analogue? But they won't necessarily have been recording with a fine enough level of detail and thus may be slightly blurry or distorted. Consider that an equivalent situation in gaming might be to play something like Quake on a modern computer: it looks a little odd simply because you can see how low-res the textures are in a way that wouldn't have been possible in 1996.<br><br>I don't think there's any suitable description for the kind of stupidity that could ever drive anyone to recommend SD over HD to you just because your original media was recorded in a lower quality.<br><br>The label has probably been harmful; it implies something new and scary where there isn't anything. It's just the up-to-date (not new, <i>standard</i> by now) version of the technology. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You will wonder how you lived without it.<br><br>Broadcast channels, which I don't have, are in whatever definition they are.<br><br>On my cable service there are seperate channels for standard and high definition. The HD channels nearly always end in D or HD. For example I have CNN and CNNHD, CBS and CBS-D.<br><br>Can you shut it off? You don't want to, but the TV will have several inputs. I use two of them. One comes directly from the cable box. So it is in whatever definition the channel is. The other if from my old DVR/VCR, which also takes input from the cable box. This reduces to standard definition. So in effect I can choose which definition to use by selecting inputs. Incidentally it upscales DVDs to 1080 HD. This isn't true HD, but it looks remarkably good.<br><br>The biggest aggravation is probably the aspect ratio, 4:3 for SD and 16:9 for HD. The TV lets you select various modes; Zoom, Full, whatever to get the best effect. Zooming SD will generally fill the screen left-to-right and lose some image at the top and bottom. But sometimes SD movies will already be scaled to the proper ratio, typically 640 x 360. This will appear as a box in the middle of the screen unless Zoomed so it fills the screen. Again, this will be upscaled and looks better than expected but worse than HD.<br><br>Finally, don't get conned into buying hideously expensive HDMI cables. Perhaps you need them for THX/Dolby sound, but I wouldn't know. I bought four cables for $12 from buy.com and they work nicely for HD and ordinary stereo, which is all I have. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It also -degrades- over time.<br>In the store the plasma may look a little better than the LCD, but after a few years the same LCD will still be going strong while the plasma won't look as good anymore. Over time plasma TV colors may appear less vibrant and it may be a little blurrier than when it's brand new.<br><br>The difference between LCD and LED is in the backlight: LCD has a single rectangular light panel behind the screen that illuminates everything more or less equally. LED uses LEDs to illuminate small portions of the screen at a time. That means that on an LED screens you get higher contrasts, and 'black is blacker' than on an LCD screen. Side-by-side LED will look better, but LED is more expensive and the difference may not be worth the extra cost to you. LED panels also tends to be thinner than LCD.<br><br>Ditto on the cables: a digital signal works at 100% or it doesn't at all. $3 Bargain bin cables will look exactly the same as $200 monster cables. Also keep in mind that stores tend to aggressively push their 'superior' cables, often with sales people flat-out lying about the difference they'd make -- after all, the store often makes more profit on selling you a single $40 cable than they do on selling you the entire TV itself in the first place: high-tech items like computers and TV's have razor-thin profit margins these days. You will NOT get 'better colors' or 'crisper image' or whatever with a 'higher quality' cable.<br><br>As far as HD vs. SD is concerned: I had a 1080p TV for the longest time with a standard SD incoming signal. The biggest difference I noticed after switching to HD programming, is that the cartoons looked *much* crisper. life-action programming looks better too, but it was the most noticable with HD cartoons. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You know how larger resolutions in computer games provide a crisper picture?  Same applies here.  Most people consider '720p' (1280 x 720) the minimum HD resolution, where 1080p (1920 x 1080) is supported by probably the widest range of TVs.

HDMI provides the biggest bandwidth and carries both audio and video in one cable - this is the cable most devices will want you to use for HD.  Don't go to any major retailer and pay more than ~$15 for a HDMI cable, btw.  They like to sell you cables worth hundreds of dollars, when a $15 or less will do the job just fine.<br><br>If you really wanted to switch back down to SD, you'd do so by connecting standard A/V, composite or SCART cables, which are only capable of providing a 480p image.  You would look at the SD image for about 5 minutes and think to yourself 'why am I doing this?'.<br><br><div class="quote"> I understand that the HD factor will only really work, with HD compatible channels.<br>So on normal channels it will look just like it does on my old tv? <br></div><br>Yup.  Well, more or less.<br><br><div class="quote"> Also what about video cassettes and DVD's? Will those automatically be in HD,<br>or only if they were HD compatible? <br></div><br>VHS...  umm...  you can probably throw that away :) But yes it will look the same as it always did.<br>DVDs theoretically will look the same, as has been mentioned they are recorded on-disc as sub-HD.  However, a good DVD player (or a good TV) will upscale the image to a higher resolution, filtering most of the notable artefacts that comes with such highly compressed media.<br><br>Really though, you don't need a HD TV unless you want to use a console.  Film and TV are heavily pre-processed images, designed to look their best at the low resolution and frame rate they come in.  It's not going to suddenly stop looking acceptable just because you've upgraded.  You will notice *some* improvement in Blurays vs DVDs for example, but it's not going to be enough to warrant converting your entire library to Bluray, or indeed even buying the more expensive Bluray titles over the DVD versions.  Consoles on the other hand...  there's very little post-processing done on the image sent out, since consoles lack the real time power to do so, so they benefit greatly from a larger native resolution...  exactly the same as computers do.<br><br>...<br><br>As others have pointed out, get an LCD over a plasma.  Plasmas were good when LCD technology was new, but the two displays are no longer different enough to warrant spending extra on the running cost of plasmas and destroying the environment etc.  Your wallet will thank you. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That means that your HDTV will allow you to do partial zoom, widescreen, black bars, etc. which can make the image much easier to watch and less distorted, since more and more of the broadcast content is in widescreen now.<br><br>Other than that, it's pretty much "just more pixels" <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
