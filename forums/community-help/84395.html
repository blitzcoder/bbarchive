Unfortunately the software to make the DVD refused to acknowledge that I had a DVD writer installed.  Compaq's (who are actually HP) best solution was for me to buy - note; BUY! - a recovery CD from them!  I'd just paid a fortune for the bloody laptop!<br><br>I don't think so!<br><br>I flattened the drive, and reinstalled from my Vista DVD I got for my desktop, and used the licence key on the bottom of the laptop which all worked perfectly. Plus I didn't end up with all the factory pre-installed junk.<br><br>If you don't already have a DVD, but do have a legal licence key, I wouldn't see any particular harm in acquiring an ISO from a torrent site.  Although I don't condone those things I do empathise with the situation. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Try pressing F12  repeatedly on boot (or whatever your BIOS's hot-boot menu is), there is sometimes a boot from recovery option there.<br><br>Failing that, use a liveCD like Ubuntu live (run gparted/fdisk) or Partition Magic to look at the partition table (but do not modify unless you know what you are doing!). <br>If you have a strange name or type on a second one (i cant remember exactly but its called something like EISA partition or might say 'Unknown' or 'recovery') If you have this then this means it does have a recovery partition. Visit the manufacturers website to find out how to use it.<br><br>As for Downloading:<br>-Your key will likely not work as the keys are assigned to certain regions, disksets, oems etc etc. <br>-Although you are morally justified in downloading a cracked copy, i wouldn't bother as it is probably 'messed' with. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Of course, use at your own risk.) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

What I do is borrow from people that actual have windows dvd/cd, make a copy and do it from there. one thing you have to consider is that sometimes the istallation will "require" you to activate it by calling the phone number that it'll give you. don't worry as long as the key is the one registered for your computer there is no problem. You can even tell the service person you are installing it from a copy of Wondows borrowed and that you are using your own "valid key" and as long as that is true they will activate it for you.<br>That is the way they do it in the States but I don't guarantee thats what they'll do in the UK. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
