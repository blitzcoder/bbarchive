Not really a great plan though.<br><br>If you have a suitable PayPal account, rather than have people email you, perhaps you could build a whole site? You can pull that off without too much expense. Then you could link to a more formal sales method as well, like ShareIt (that's what they use here, right? It's been a while...).<br><br>I've only tried one way of selling games myself - the old-fashioned way. Buy a few hundred CDs, spend a couple of days (preferably with friends, and their laptops) burning CDs and printing labels, stick 'em all in a box and sell them in person, for cash (or whatever, but PayPal isn't recommended for selling things in person) at whatever large area events are available, or school/university/work. This is good for immediate success - you'll probably sell all your copies (I did, anyway), because it's much easier to get attention by talking to people than waiting in a cold, dark corner of the internet for them to come to you - but not so good for the longer term or larger projects, as it gains you basically no publicity (unless your game is such a hit people talk about it later) and is a fair amount of effort. Still, you can make your first small profit that way and spend it on advertising for your website or something. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The biggest problem is that you need a LOT of visitors to get any significant sales, and it's very difficult to harness that kind of traffic.<br><br>That's why portals like BigFish, Oberon, MediaHouse, RealArcade, etc. are so popular: Those companies may take a huge chunk of the sales, but they also have millions of visitors that will see your game (and/or playable demo) listed.<br><br>Getting 30% for thousands of sold copies is more cash in your pocket than getting 100% of 1-2 sold copies on your own site.<br><br>Of course, your game does need to be good enough to pass the portals own quality control department -- meaning it should look good, play good, be bug-free, and fun. (Of course, if no portals are even remotely interested in the game, it's probably time to go back to the drawing board anyway.)<br><br><div class="quote"> Or is it possible to sell my games through Ebay? <br></div><br><br>Possible, but the problem with ebay is that they tend to routinely kill auctions of burned CD media since it can easily be mistaken for pirated copies. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
