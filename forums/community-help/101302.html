I bought some ink and refillable cartridges, which work OK mostly, but the quality is far from perfect.  The refillable (clear) cartridges and ink cost me barely more than one set of genuine cartridges, and there's enough ink to fill them all six times over.  So figured it was worth a shot.<br><br>The refillable ones come with their own chip attached.  Would it help any to remove this chip and replace it with ones taken from genuine HP cartridges?  Or is it ultimately just a bit of metal to connect terminals together inside the printer?<br><br>Anyhoo...<br><br>I really need the quality back.  My current printer is an HP Photosmart 5510.  I was looking into the possibility of a laser printer - even a mono one as I don't really need to print anything in color.<br><br>Printer ink is so bloody extortionate, there has to be away of avoiding being ripped off for printer consumables, without sacrificing quality. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Would it help any to remove this chip and replace it with ones taken from genuine HP cartridges? <br></div><br><br>No, since the chip also keeps track of the amount you print, and eventually "knows" that the cartridge is supposed to be empty and refuse to print more. (That's also why the refilling doesn't always work)<br><br>Personally I gave up on inkjets a long time ago: Laserjets are much cheaper per print, and more importantly, have a much longer lifespan in situations where you DON'T print for an extended time as well.<br>If you don't use an inkjet for a month, there's a real chance that ink drops at the end of the nozzle will clog and either make fore really messy prints, or refuse to print altogether. <br>A laserprinter doesn't have that problem and will happily continue to print after long breaks.<br><br>Toner cartridges are more expensive than ink cartridges, but they last a LOT longer as well.<br><br>another advantage is that laser printer tend to have higher build standards, and the device itself doesn't die as quickly on you. (At the office we still have a few laserjet 4's happily trucking along, 19 years after they were put into service)<br><br>Plus laser's are a lot cheaper than they used to be as well: You can find a lot of the entry level models in the $85-$100 range.<br><br>(I haven't made the change to a color laserjet yet, since the 4 toner cartridges that are necessary for thjose are a bit prohibitively expensive... I'm using a Brother 7440n multifunction laser printer myself: monochrome printer, color scanner with automatic document feeder, fax, and ethernet connectivity (print, scan and fax from/to multiple computers, or even scan to email/FTP)<br><br><div class="quote"> For my current printer, a genuine HP 364XL cart can be had for around £17, giving ~550 pages (3.1p/page).

Having to throw out a clogged cartridge that still has 400 pages worth of ink left in its tank also means that know that 3.1/p page became ~10p/page instead.<br>On the laser side, toner doesn't go "bad" <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

No difference that I can see compared to the official brother cartridges, except they were half the price.<br><br><br>Now, keep in mind that in addition to the compatible cartridges, you can also buy cheap remanufactured / recycled cartridges.<br><br>Some of the laser printers have the drum as part of the cartridge, while others have it as a seperate component. (Just like with inkjets, some brands have the printing heads as part of the cartridge, and others have them as a seperate component)<br><br>Anyway -- Depending on the model, the drum typically lasts you for ~10-15,000 prints. HP printers have the drum built into the toner. If you buy a refilled cartridge, you typically still have the original drum and 2-3 refills later the drum starts to wear out leading to substandard print quality (e.g. vertical lines, fuzzyness)<br>That means that buying a refilled cartridge is the luck of the draw: First or second refill they are pretty much indistinguishable from the original cartridges, but if you happen to get one that has had had more re-fill trips in the past then the quality may be substandard.<br><br>some of the refill/remanufacturerd companies also have an in-between option available, where you buy a refilled cartridge *with a new drum*. Cheaper than an original cartridge, more expensive than one with just new toner refill, but more predictable quality than the latter. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I also have some tips for you. I know you said you're not an artist, but even so if you have a lot of old notes with maybe faint lines, use graph mode, brightness 4 of 5. You'll get every last detail, it's awesome. This model is also quite inexpensive. Yes you'll save money on toner, but everyone always forgets, toner also makes for waterproof prints! It's powdered wax that actually gets melted into the paper fibers. Also, always turn off the main switch when you're done, or you'll be wondering why the lights keep dimming all night and your power bill's high. Oh, and they told me to only use lazer paper. I don't know why. Best of luck, and again trust me, you won't regret this purchase. There's no faster or better way to make a hard copy of all your precious work. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
