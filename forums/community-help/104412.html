Perhaps you put the engine routines into a dll...What's to prevent somebody from accessing the routines from C++?

An intermediate format that's hard to read doesn't help with that; all it does is force people to use the same version of GCC as you (this isn't even a secret, since you have to tell them so they can use it at all).<br><br><br>You <i>cannot</i> stop people from using your engine from C++ (or any language with similar low-level operations). Literally can't be done. Once code is on the other person's machine, they can inspect it and manipulate it and so on to whatever end they like. There is no technological way to prevent this. I have to restate this for emphasis: there is <i>no way</i> to prevent someone looking at code once it's on their machine. The difference between closed- and open-source binaries is not in what the user <i>can</i> do, but strictly in what you've given them <i>permission</i> to do - they can do anything they want, in either case.<br><br>Which is why the way you stop people using your product without permission is with a <b>licence agreement</b>, making the permissions on usage explicit, and binding. This is the <i>only</i> strategy that works. If someone redistributes your code without sticking to the agreement (either making changes, or pirating), you C&amp;D them. If they aren't redistributing the code, there's nothing to worry about (what people do in their own homes is their own business).<br><br>If your engine is actually intended more for casual "play-about" users than game developers, then you need to target the unauthorized download sources so the end users come to you; if your engine is intended primarily for developers, then this is a non-issue because only a complete lunatic would release a commercial game using a pirated engine. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
