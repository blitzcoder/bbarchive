And how would using this effect the game itself? <br></div><br><br>...um?<br><br>ODE is one library that provides physics simulation, out of many (you have identified others; they all do fairly similar things). ODE's main selling points are that it is quite lightweight and simple compared to more powerful solutions like PhysX, but this does mean that it won't take advantage of, e.g. GPU acceleration, and it may have some stability problems if you set up a scene badly.<br><br>Physics simulation gives objects natural movement, letting them bounce off each other, roll around their centre of mass, fall with gravity, etc. Blitz3D does not provide any kind of physics simulation built-in (only a very basic collision detection system), so you need a physics engine if you want objects to move as though realistic forces are acting on them.<br><br>A physics engine can be used to simply improve the sense of realism (e.g. corpses that ragdoll instead of playing a preset death animation; objects that fall over when damaged), or it could be a core gameplay element (racing games usually need to make heavy use of it; perhaps you could make a game about stacking blocks or something).<br><br>(I don't know anything about BlitzBullet; have not used.)<br><br><br>...on the other hand, if you don't know what a physics engine is needed for, why are you investigating them?<br><br>You should decide what you want to do, then find the tools to implement it, not look for excuses to use physics engines because they seem to be a popular component.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

BlitzODE and Vorderman's ODE may be slightly slower due to being much older.<br><br>However, if DBPro doesn't use the standard ODE command set (which I assume is the case if you needed to ask about BlitzODE's fairly standard commands), then you may find it a tad more difficult to do a straight port, and the commands may be doing different things in the background.<br><br>PhysX will be faster than ODE on modern machines, but (in my limited experience) slower on older ones.<br><br>While I have no experience using Bullet, it does seem to still be actively maintained, whereas ODE hasn't been updated in a couple of years now; so ODE may be less up-to-date.<br><br>You may be able to get specific optimisations out of each possibility depending on what your application needs, since the different engines have different points of focus.<br><br>All things considered however, speed should be a non-issue: all of the engines are adequately fast for most purposes, and you really aren't going to notice any difference between them.<br><br>If you were using ODE before and are familiar with it, your best option is to continue to use it, since 1) you know it serves your project's needs, and 2) you already know how it works. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I thought so anyway)<br>-- PhysX is a lot larger and more heavyweight, requires an actual complex installation (ODE is just one file)<br><br>So, if you need snazzy features like soft bodies, you need PhysX. If you intend to have massively complex scenes with thousands of small objects colliding at once and interacting with funny magnetic forces to form complex structures, you have a high-end simulation that would be better off on PhysX (not least because it wouldn't run on old hardware anyway).<br><br>On the other hand, if all you want is to have stackable boxes and ragdoll corpses in the background of a generic FPS, then no, there is no great value in changing to PhysX.<br><br>The fact is that there are different best tools for different purposes here, and you're not going to get an answer to "which physics engine is best", no matter how you rephrase it, <i>because it's the wrong question</i>.<br><br>Also, as I pointed out above, it's "PhysX".
