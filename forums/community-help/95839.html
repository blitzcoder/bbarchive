There's an old adage 'Lie and Buy' which refers to lieing about your abilities then buying a book to learn those skills.<br><br>Databases are not games.  They hold real life data and represent real life information.  Irrespective of whether it's stock control, fleet management, banking, insurance or a social care system these systems impinge upon peoples lives either directly or indirectly, and they sure as hell impact upon the people running the systems.  "I'll rewrite if I screw up" is not good enough - have some damned professionalism and integrity!<br><br>I use MS-SQL in my day job and I think it rocks - then again, I generally work corporately and don't run into the scalability issues that Oracle suggests it's better at resolving.  Oh, and it shouldn't matter what platform you run on, you can connect to any datasource from any platform (appreciatively on hosted sites that may not be the case.)  MySQL has certain issues with it that stopped me from using it but off the top of my head I can't remember what they were and that was a few years ago so may have been resolved, and again is very good value for money.  Access in a professional environment, as far as I'm concerned, is a big no-no.  I used it for many years, wrote a large number of systems but ultimately was disatisfied with performance and durability.  So I'd go for MS-SQL or MS-SQL Express(?) which is a free version of it, though it does have limits.<br><br>Oh, and let me tell you - I'm really good with databases and know what I'm doing with them.  You do NOT pick up those skills with a 'Teach yourself in 24 hours' - ultimately, as with any other skill, it's when you know how to ask the right questions that you start to learn properly.<br><br>Sorry if the above seems like a rant, and I guess it is.  It's not meant to be unfriendly but is exactly what I'd say to a friend or to someones face.  Good luck with your venture but know what you're doing first.<br><br>Goodbye. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Nice. What you're doing is misrepresenting yourself as an "expert" at something you don't know much of anything about.
