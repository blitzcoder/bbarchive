I tend to fall into 2 equally successful/failure prone methods:<br>1) Firm design plan: Outline the game concept, game play elements, build an asset list, etc.<br>2) Have an idea and see where it goes: This one is more likely to fail for normal people, but for me it can work. I just start with an idea, code it up quick and dirty and see where it takes me. The hard part is knowing when to tie off growth of the concept and just cram in some menus and turn it into a playable game for other people. It's VERY easy to get bored and walk away (this is generally when I force myself to finnish it up so I haven't wasted my time) or to just go on forever (I pay attention to my interest level, when it starts to fade it's time to tie it off). This isn't a good method for anyone who has trouble tying projects off cleanly, and would not work on anything more than a 1 man job I believe, but it is my preferred method since it's totally free form and lets me dive right into whatever my brain is interested in (higher productivity when you're really pumped to work on something specific).<br><br>I would urge anyone to try this: Make a game sketch. Design out what you want it to do. Make it as simple as you can stomach (does the main character need 20 different guns? does he need any actually?). Sit down and make that game. Doesn't matter if you make it crappy, just finnish it. Finishing something you set out to make like that gives you a sense of perspective that is invaluable in both designing and building things in the future. There's no other way to get the perspective that you need to be able to finish things until you've finished your first thing. It doesn't get easier to finish things, but you do get better at it which definitely helps.<br><br>That said, don't finish everything. Those abandoned experiments are invaluable learning tools in their own right... but not finishing things is a lot easier so it's not really much of a goal :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
