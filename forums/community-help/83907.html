UV Mapping in Wings 3d
This primer will show how to unwrap and texture a model using Wings 3d and Gimp.

    * In Wings select body selection mode (press B key) and select the object you want to skin.

    * Right click (RMB) and choose UV Mapping, this will open the UV Editor window.

    * RMB in the UV Editor window and choose either 'Segment by &gt; Projection' or 'Segment by &gt; Feature Detection', or select faces and assign AuvChart materials manually. Refer to the Wings manual for details about the different methods.

    * If you used one of the two automatic methods above you might want to fine tune the segmentation by assigning AuvChart materials manually, or if you're satified continue to the next step.

    * Now it's time to unwrap the different segments onto a two dimensional texture area. RMB and choose either 'Continue &gt; Unfolding' or 'Continue &gt; Projection'. Refer to the Wings manual for an explanation of the two methods.

    * The 3d view will now be replaced with a 2d view in the UV Editor window, and the unwrapped segments is layed out automatically. You might want to rearrange them to a better fit in the window by moving, scaling, and rotating the segments just like you would do with regular geometry.

    * RMB and choose 'Create Texture' and set the draw options you want.

    * Open the Outliner window if not already open. You will notice that a texture normaly called 'diffuse' has been created. Select it, RMB and choose 'Show' to preview. You might want to reiterate the step above to get the draw options you like for the guide drawn in the texture.

    * Select the texture in the Outliner, RMB and choose 'Make External' and save it to disk.

    * Now fire up Gimp and open the image file you saved in the previous step. Do your best to paint the texture and save your work.

    * Switch back to Wings, select the texture in the Outliner, RMB and choose 'Refresh'. The texture will be reloaded from the file and your work will show up in both the UV Editor and Geometry window. You might want to reiterate this and the previous step, swithing back and forth between Gimp and Wings, until you're satisfied with the texture.

    * When satisfied; select the texture in the Outliner, RMB and choose 'Make Internal'.

    * Now you can export the model to a 3ds file and convert with nscemake, or import it into Blender for rigging and animation.

Select the "UV Remap" menu option and when you paint in the joined UV polys your brush strokes will be remapped to where the moved UV polys came from. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you need distinct patterns or images on your models, then use the UV editor to make your models texture-ready.<br><br>If you only need to apply solid colors to certain objects or surfaces, though, then no fiddly UV mapping required. Try this mini-tutorial out; oh, and make sure you're using the most recent version of W3D, which is <b>0.99.04a</b>.<br><br><br><div class="quote"> First off, we'll make a cube &amp; color it.<br><br>1: Create a cube.<br><br>2: Enter face selection mode and press Ctrl+A to select all six faces.<br><br>3: Right-click to open the Face Operations menu, and select "Material -&gt; New..."<br><br>4: Name your new material; anything will do, like "Blue 1" or whatever.
