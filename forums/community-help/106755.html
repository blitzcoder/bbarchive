Should I use IIS with a web-based approach to uploading the files? is it bad practice to have an exe running on the server listening to a port for communication?<br><br>I guess I'm asking what would the best approaches and directions that I should head towards to starting achieving this goal?<br><br>This kind of server work is all new to me and I find it quite exciting learning and venturing into new grounds.<br><br>Thanks! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

What happens is the client will use a closed application on their side. This application creates the new files and folders which I can guarantee are unique. Then the client side software, as opposed to the user, should upload the folders/files that it created to the server. At a later time another client would want to search through all the uploaded files so I was going to use a database for a quick lookup. That search utility could easily have a browser front end interface. So I would write the server side code to handle the 'file copy', and also log the folder location where the server puts the folders/files into a database.<br><br>Knowing this, would that change your opinion of what kind of client-server communication would be best to use? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The uploads have to be complete or they don't exist, resuming and such things are not allowed - the files all have to be on the on the server or not - so any incomplete transfers will be deleted server side, and the client machine will attempt again at a different time. The important data is stored locally on the client machine until such time that it has managed to transfer it to the server. If that local storage is full then the client machine cannot be used. To be honest this makes the job a lot easier from both server and client code due to not having to worry about partial transfers.<br><br>The main part that was on my mind was whether its 'standard' practice to use a command line exe listening on the server or whether I *should* be using some kind of web-based approach - more modern fads?. I think you've cleared that part for me, so I can now progress full steam ahead knowing that I am heading in the right direction at least. Thankyou!<br><br>For a couple of years now this project was being used, as I said, in a very controlled environment, but using just local servers ( totally isolated and physical secured ) so I used standard network paths, but that's progressed on to more and more remote servers and of course the requirement for security during the transfer, even though the network is very secure from the outside in, I want to make sure that inside the network the transfers are also secure too, call it overkill but that's the kind of level I need to look to.<br><br>So although the system will seem to be the same from the users point of view, the mechanics that go on in the background have to step up a few gears to remain compliant.<br><br>Thanks for your help guys!<br><br>ps<br><div class="quote"> no clue what to use of windows binaries to achieve such things <br></div><br>Windows has the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms867086.aspx" target="_blank">CryptoAPI</a> along with its <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa376210(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank">NG</a> version. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
