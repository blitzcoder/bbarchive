Now I know on a little android device it takes a couple of seconds.  Assuming a similar time for a server....and assuming let's say during peak time there were 10 of these calculations produced per hour per user...so we are looking at say a total processing time of 30 seconds per user per hour during peak times....<br><br>How many users could different types of server handle.<br><br>Think in a turn based game such as the old combat mission series where a replay is generated by fairly complex physical simulation and then sent to the relevant users.   That's kind of what I'm working on.<br><br>Am I over thinking this?<br><br>Would it be easier just to let users report(suspected) cheats (in public games) and simply temporarily ban users whose "suspicious activity" score reached a threshold, <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If the results match, trust the next couple of calculations, then do another side-by-side verify every so often to make sure they didn't start cheating later.<br><br>If the results don't match, you can take action by doing more frequent verification -- if there's a pattern of discrepancy, take action by either having the server take care of all calculations for that particular user defeating their cheating, or simply banning the user completely to send a message and prevent future cheating by him or others.<br><br>At least that will help you offset some of the load to the user, and your server can handle more users overall.<br><br>Oh, and keep in mind: if your calculation depends on floating point variables at all, you may see some very slight variations in the results depending on the processor or other computer architecture. You may want to built in a slight fudge-factor when comparing the calculation end results, e.g. as long as the results are at least 99.5% similar, treat them as genuine. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I imagine any small discrepancies will cause the two simulations to diverge pretty quickly.  <br><br>I think what I will do is trust users in private games (if they want to cheat with their mates then that's their issue) but for public games I will probably allow users to enable an option that lets them flag cheats like I was saying. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If the factors hash is already invalid, the server does not need to calculate results.<br><br>You can grain it finer and finer by submitting inbetween hashes of deterministic results ... I mean calculations using game provided data (unit levels, health points). So you might save time when validating (hash &lt;&gt; hash instead of a more complicated calculation using 20 deterministic factors).<br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
