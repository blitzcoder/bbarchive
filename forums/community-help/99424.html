If you're on board then you're on board, otherwise you're not because it doesn't make any sense if you're not buying into the whole live you life in the cloud pitch.<br><br>Of note: you can use a chrome book in a limited capacity offline, but really if you're not expecting 99% up time on your internet connection don't bother, you lose out over anything else that was actually designed to be used offline from the start rather than having app caching for offline use patched in down the road.<br><br>If ALL you want to do is write and browse the web, and you expect to be near wifi basically ALL the time, or you are willing to invest in a cell connection of some type then a chrome book is a really interesting thing. No worrying about your docs. No updating, none of the daily hassles. In the real world you're paying *extra* for simplicity, not saving money by having things removed.<br><br>If you might be offline for an hour, or you'd like any kind of control over what you're using the chrome book goes right off the table as a viable option. In the real world there are HUGE numbers of people that *could* use a chromebook as their main system (grandma for example. never leaves the house, would like to sit in her favorite chair, doesn't get the concept of moving windows around, etc.). But at the price point, and with any level of historical computer experience it's all wall and no garden. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
