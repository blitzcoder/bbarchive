I have a few HP desk-jet printers I keep around because the ink is so cheap. The Desk-jet 700 - 900 series never needed a driver with XP which made it a simple plug &amp; play device.<br><br>Now after hooking it up via serial port Windows 7 recognizes it as a Desk-jet 710 printer. It's actually a 712c but they all use the same driver so no worries. It reports the printer working but I cannot get it to print no matter what I try. HP recommends you use windows update which is utterly unless at fixing anything.<br><br>It worked with XP so it should work with 7. This is the 32bit edition. Any idea's? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Downside is that you can't see the amount of remaining toner and such, but at least the damn thing will print without errors after disabling the feature. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

With the 5550 using the parallel port vs the usb port made no difference in the compatibility issues.  It is part of why I now use a Brother Laser Printer. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

What I meant when I said serial was the parallel port. I will check options in the bios and so far I've had no luck with Oracle VM. I'm not sure why any of those settings would have changed since this very same machine used to run XP natively.<br><br>In the XP VM it shows up under printers but the jobs just queue up or say out of paper. However there is some weirdness in the device manager. What I expected to see isn't there and this has to do with the VM drivers.<br><br>This is not a fancy printer so it bothers me a bit that a device so low level won't work on Windows 7. I had to install my video drivers under XP mode but after that it worked fine. I really don't feel like buying a new printer because newer ones (especially brothers) eat up ink like crazy. Friends and family kept giving me these old Deskjets because they knew I still ran XP. So I have 4 now that I can't use unless I hook up one of my XP boxes. :(<br><br>I have a really nice canon and epson printer but can't afford the ink. LOL <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
