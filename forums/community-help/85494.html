Revenue is low, though -- rates vary among companies, but for the most part you can forget about getting any significant amount of money unless people actually click and follow an ad. The bottom pretty much fell out of the pay-per-view ad model, in part thanks to the populatiry of adblockers. Pay-per-click is a more interesting metric for the advertiser, so they'll pay more for that.<br><br>And keep in mind: Actually *telling* (or asking) your customers to click on the ads is considered clickfraud by most of the networks, so don't do that.<br><br>The biggest ad networks: Google Adwords/Adsense, Yahoo Search Marketing and Microsoft AdCenter. Probably the easiest way to implement it (in windowed mode, at least) is an embedded HTMLView in a MaxGUI framework, that way you don't have to do anything fancy to show the ads, and you have a lot more network you can do business with than if you were to have your own proprietary methods of capturing/showing the ads. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
