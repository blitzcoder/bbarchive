In the last five weeks or so, that's dropped to exactly 2Mbps.  Every speed test I do comes to at least 1.97Mbps, often 1.99Mbps.<br><br>I'm not over the usage limit, BT claim they are not restricting my speed, but I beg to differ.  I have had heated email exchanges with their so-called Customer Service people in Delhi or wherever the hell they are, and got absolutely nowhere.  They repeatedly tell me to check things in their copy/pasted emails that I have told them I've already done.  Eventually I got them to escalate the matter, and immediately (literally, it was about a minute from getting the fault log email when I checked it) the problem was flagged as "fixed".  The only option I had available to to "accept as fixed".  But it isn't!<br><br>I've now had to start ALL OVER AGAIN, only this time I've gone through their complaints procedure and threatened to take my business elsewhere.  I thought that was getting a result when they offered to send a BT Broadband engineer out to check things over.  What they DIDN'T tell me (and I just found this out today), is that they are planning on charging my £99+VAT for their engineer's little jaunt to my house!  They tried that before at a previous address, and sent THREE engineers as I KNEW there was a line fault, but the first two didn't do their job right and couldn't find a problem.  The third engineer sorted it in 20 minutes but they still tried charging me for the first two callouts!<br><br>I am absolutely pig bloody sick of BT, and I've just this second emailed them to request a MAC code.  They don't give a toss about their customers, and I'll be buggered if I'm going to keep paying them over £40 a month when they've effectively cut my service to 30% of what it was little more than a month ago, and are plotting to charge me another £120+ for THEM to fix it.<br><br>I'm looking at going to either Sky or O2 for broadband and phone/line rental, and BT can kiss my rosy red arse.  No provider on this planet can possibly do a worse job than British Telecom (which in my opinion should be called India Telecom, since what's where 90% of their staff live).<br><br>Any recommendations for phone/broadband? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Over a week I  had no broadband, given the same old "wait 24 hours" bull, nowt... <br><br>Then one of them said "We will escalate your problem"... Then I blew up... I was like "ESCALATE... ESCALATE... I've got no bloody broadband man, I've had none for a week, and your trying to soften it up by saying your going to escalate my problem... I have a problem, it's not bloody working, you've had all week, I couldnt give a shit about your buzz word bollocks, honestly, if you dont get it back on within 24 hours, I'll conclude that your company is a pile of bollocks and I'll just go somewhere else"... Then hung up... Suffice to say, it never got fixed, I got my Mac code, moved to (funnily enough) BT, took a few days to get connected...

Both barrels!!! :D<br><br>A few months later I was just coming out of my front door, there was a bridle path that ran along the front of the houses, and as soon as I stepped out, a bloke appeared with a Talk Talk ID thing around his neck, he went "Hi, may I ask who your broadband provider is?", I went "If you think I'm going to go with your lot you've got another thing coming, your rubbish"... He was like "Oh, have you been with us before?", I was "Aye, and I'll never go back to you again", I explained why... Language barrier, if I cannot pay my bill, well, what can I do, I hated the fact that call centres got shipped abroad, not in a racist issue, on the simple fact it's a sodding nightmare ringing the places and talking to someone who doesnt understand you...<br><br>To my amazement, this Talk Talk rep give me the biggest racist rant I'd ever heard... Proper BNP slaver... I was shocked, and just walked away in disbelief... Still cannot believe it now!!! <br><br>Dabz <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

As I'm sure you know, it all goes through BT OpenReach and I can tell you from experience, that BT OpenReach is by far the worst part of the company to deal with. Your actual provider will be bullied into blaming you and will do nothing to stand up for you against OR. If they're intentionally throttling you and there's no line fault, then you might well benefit from moving to another provider. I've never noticed any throttling on Sky.<br><br>Are you in a cabled area? Virgin Media are typically considerably more expensive than most (all?) of the BT-powered services, but you do get what you paid for.

Initially with their old Netgear routers (wireless G) I had poor connections (around 1-3Mbps which varied from day to day). I thought I couldn't get better speeds than this since I am over 3 miles from the local exchange ... their help support is pretty helpful and went over my setup. They advised me to get a faceplate (I got this one) :-<br><br><a href="http://www.run-it-direct.co.uk/BTNTE5ADSLfaceplate.html" target="_blank">http://www.run-it-direct.co.uk/BTNTE5ADSLfaceplate.html</a><br><br>I then enquired about their new Sagem wireless routers (these are much better than Netgear) and I also bought my own 300mbps wireless usb adapter and got rid of the crappy netgear one (which incidentally would disconnect once it got too hot). I now get a stable 6.5Mbps which is a hell of a lot improvement than the crappy speeds I was getting before.<br><br>Oh remember if you talk to Sky support, you can ask them to boost your broadband speeds ... when you get broadband from them they limit the speed for everyone unless you ASK them to boost it ... they will retest the line and give you the fastest possible speed. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
