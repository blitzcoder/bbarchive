I talked about Blitz 3D in a thread below this one, but you know what? I'm thinking about checking out the Unity software. I guess it's not straight programming like 3D Blitz is (though I wish it were - because I enjoy programming). Yes, some would say go to Monkey. Well, I'm already using Monkey for 2D purposes, but so far as 3D programming there seems to be WAYYYY more material including countless videos on youtube that shows how to use Unity. Well, I'm a visual learning you know. And Unity seems to do more of what I want it to do instantaneously.  So, what do you all think about this idea?<br><br><br>BTW, I have another thing I want to say. I also make 2D games in Java AND JavaScript. I keep the program called "Eclipse" on a flash drive i.e. the entire executable AND keep ALL of my game project files on the flash drive too so that whenever I want to resume doing my Java or JavaScript game projects, I can plug in the flash drive on ANY computer and resume working on my project out of Eclipse from the flash drive. It's just a plug in and play kind of deal.So thus, I just wish that Unity 3D/Blitz 3D/Monkey were that way.  It's very convenient.  But, this is just a rant. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

LuaJIT is a native code compiler, not an interpreter (well, there is a supplemental interpreter that it uses as fallback). It's also one of the best native-code compilers out there, faster than almost anything other than hand-written C code. It definitely produces faster code than Mark's Max compiler, and probably beats Brucey's too (I'm guessing the NG compiler mainly lags behind on GC, if it's still using Boehm). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Besides, I also enjoy web programming and in the thread above, I discovered the Oskit that makes it so that I could more easily upload my Blitz 3D games to the web; something that has been my goal. Man, that Oskit seems like an important tool. So thus, I'm now back using Blitz 3D again (after a full circle of learning a lot of stuff). I still have to learn everything with it because 3D game making is still new to me, but I'll just learn as I go Thus, thanks for the input and insight.
