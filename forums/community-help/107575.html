I'm a bit vague on this too, so hopefully someone can explain it a lot better if they understand what's needed.<br><br>You're asking how graphics can be located in the right places on the screen when there's an option to change the resolution of the screen display, if I'm correct?<br><br>You can use SetVirtualResolution which can be adjusted so that no matter what size screen mode the user has in place, the code can use default location data for images for say a 1024/768 standard resolution. I think NG does something like this when it compiles to tablet so games look ok on both Iphone resolutions, and Ipads. You might end up with some images that look far too chunky if they're designed for a lower resolution screen and are put onto a device that has a drastically different detail level unless you created an alternative image set. Kind of like what XCode allows you to set up in projects developed on that.<br><br>I'm no expert with virtual resolution though, so please forgive me if I misunderstood the correct use here.<br><br>Another way to do it would be to have some kind of screen size x and y information read in and use a formula for all images being displayed which takes these into account so they get placed at the right spot, no matter what size the screen is. I'm only theorizing this, however, because I've always just had a couple of modes defined and hard code the images accordingly, because I don't know how either as yet. Or, if I'm being a bit crap then I'll just use a default of 1024 * 768 as I doubt there's much equipment out there that can't display that. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you don't care, then no one is <i>making</i> you.<br>However, if you are creating a commercial game, then keep in mind that every computer it won't run on is a potential tech support case, bad review, and return/refund.<br><br>Here's a good starting point: The steam hardware survey, which is based on the specs of hundreds of thousands of Steam users. It shows that the vast majority of people run on a widescreen setup, but 1024x768 and 1280x1024 still add up to 5.68% of the market.<br><br><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey" target="_blank">http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey</a><br><br>But keep in mind that even in widescreen, not all computers support the same resolutions. 1920x1080 is the most popular with 38% of people running it, but almost 25% only does 1366x768 -- and another 2 percent 1360x768, many of which will NOT support 1366x768.<br><br>I'd suspect that most of the people running 1366x768 do so because it's the max resolution of their laptop display. If you make your game 1920x1080, that will mean that it won't run on a full 1/3 of the computers out there. Even if you don't feel like dealing with 4:3 and 5:4 screens, you at least should try to accommodate other widescreen resolutions. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
