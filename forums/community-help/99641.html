What i have not thought about until now is that there will be doors in some passages and these doors will be either locked or unlocked, so how i am supposed to disable some links where there is a door blocking the passage during the path calculation, knowing that my nodes and links are not associated with doors ?<br><br>I am not sure how to manage this, what do you guys do for this ?<br>Do you store a variable to take into account an obstructed link because of a locked/blocked door ?<br><br>Ok thanks ! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

"TDoors.checkBlocking(node1, node2)")<br>(+) redundant code is minimized<br>(-) path finding is doing more work than needed.<br><br><br>In most cases "1)" is the most easier way to do so.<br>Instead of storing "up is blocked" you could also store "onTheLeft:object = XYZ" etc. so lookup for certain doors is saved and therefor some performance is given back...<br><br>All depends on: amount of doors, amount of nodes etc.<br><br><br>There are surely more methods - but yeah, now you have 2 more to consider.<br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You find which portals cross each of the links in a pre-process step, when you're loading the level for gameplay.<br>During gameplay, whenever you consider a link for travelling you go through all portals in the link's "intersecting portals" array, and check if any is closed - if so, try a different path or have the actor stop and stay idle at a certain distance from the closed portal (as if he's waiting for the portal to open or something like that). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Another challenge !<br>Let's say a character has already calculated a path to its target, and one door which was unlocked at the time of the path calculation becomes locked when the character is following the path.<br><br>Hum... I guess a possible approach would be to let the character follow its path until he reaches the locked door, and when he becomes aware of this, to make him calculate another path.<br><br>I don't think this will be a problem in my current project because the characters will only be able to calculate/follow a path to the player in the same room or to a door which goes to a room where the player was last seen or heard.<br><br>But if i want to add activities that the characters can do, this can be a problem and this makes another thing to consider : How much awareness of the environement of a World/Zone/Room a character should have ?<br><br>When i want to go to specific room or to get a specific object in the environments i know, i know which path to follow, but when i don't know the environements, i don't know which path to follow.<br>If i have a key, i know i can go through a door possibly locked, if i don't have a key i know i may not be able to go through a door possibly locked, or at least not with the key (but i may be able to pick the lock or to break it or to follow somebody who go through the door or to knock and pretent i am a delivery man ;) ).<br><br>This can become very complex to consider all these parameters ! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
