They also push software updates through Xbox Live. The "Silver" membership is free, the "Gold" membership costs.<br><br>The Xbox 360 Arcade console does not have a hard disk. All other versions of the Xbox have either a 20 GB, 60 GB or 120 GB hard disk. The 20 GB model is no longer sold, current versions start with 60 GB.<br><br>And yes, you will need a computer with Windows XP or Windows Vista and at least Microsoft's free-of-charge version of Game Studio.  And you need to become a member of the XNA Creator's Club - which is a different beast than Xbox Live, but you also need to be a member of Xbox Live (which basically all Xbox owners are anyway). The Game Creator's Club membership allows you to upload your games to Xbox Live and to transfer them to your own Xbox 360. <br><br>And, yes, you definitely need an Xbox 360. Game Studio does not come with a software emulator for the Xbox 360 (would be a bit of problem, regarding the specs of the Xbox 360, which basically is a triple core 3 GHz PowerPC G5). There's only a software emulator for the Zune coming with Game Studio - which means, yes, you can also write games for the Zune with XNA.<br><br>You really should visit more official Xbox/XNA forums for more info. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

A free Silver account will be enough to transfer your games to the Xbox. You will only need Gold (the paid one) if you want to do networking or online gaming.<br>2) You do not need an Xbox right away. While there is no Xbox hardware emulator, it's usually very easy to write your games on Windows, and when you have an Xbox/want to submit to XBLCG you can convert your project into an Xbox compatibly project in literally 3 mouse clicks.<br>3) When you're ready, the minimum Xbox you can use for XNA development is the Pro version. You absolutely, 100% need a hard drive! A Memory Unit is also a good investment, since there's some storage device code that can only be tested with one of those.<br>4) The Premium Membership ($100/yr) is only needed for when you're ready to submit to XBLCG, or want to Playtest or Peer Review other games on the service. Also, you cannot deploy games to your Xbox without the Premium Membership.<br><br>So, you can try out XNA for $0 down. You should go to the XNA forums, and read all the FAQs. They will tell you what you need to know! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's still possible to connect multiple Xboxes on a home network and play against each other without that online feature.<br><br>The Creator's Club Membership is not expensive and it gives you access to Microsoft's Xbox Marketplace to advertise and sell your game there - like Apple's AppStore, but as far as I know, without Apple's arbitrary approval policy.<br><br>In summary, I think the Xbox 360 is the most attractive console platform on the market, for both gamers (greatest choice of games, best hardware platform for games) and game creators (lowest barrier of entry).<br><br>You should also not forget that Microsoft's XNA is a multi-platform tool. You can develop for Windows, the Zune and the Xbox 360 with it. Why don't you simply start with XNA for Windows and  when you're making progress and like it, you can still buy an Xbox 360 and the required memberships and make your product run on the Xbox, TOO.<br><br>I think that the console market has a much brighter future than the game market on PCs, so I find this perspective very attractive. But that's just me. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
