These can take place at any time - the players don't all have to be connected at the same time.<br><br>A user can be involved in more than one game at a time (of course).<br><br>Typically the flow will be player A launches attack, player B receives notification of attack and can download (or auto download) the replay and results to their device and watch at their leisure.<br><br>The question I have is:<br><br>What is the least intrusive but still useful method of notifying the user of an event in the game - while they are not currently within the game itself?<br><br>Possibilities I can think of so far are:<br><br>1) Receive an email (undesireable since I do not collect nor wish to have on record any user's email address)<br><br>2) Have a news feed in the game itself which the user must enter the game to check from time to time. <br><br>3) Display a small widget on the user's home screen (android phone) which displays some message/indicator when an event takes place.<br><br>4) Use a spot at the top of the navigation bar to indicate that something has happened.<br><br>5) Cause the phone LED light (charging light) to blink 'blue' or similar.<br><br>or 6) Wake the user at 2-3am with the sound of klaxons and sirens at full volume  before connecting to their bluetooth speaker system and playing the 1812 Overture at full volume throughout their home... ;-)<br><br>Any other possibilities? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

(looking at you freemium games, "oh please come back and play me, please, please, ok I'll leave now but I'll pop back up in 5 mins") <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
