Also you need to consider the whitespace. eg. a "Shitake mushroom"? which again is a valid name.

To remove them would make the text unreadable, to replace them would make people look &amp; feel stupid (possibly a good thing?? eg."duck you grassmole!"

And it's a problem with the interrnet at large.<br><br>Anyway, another solution to this particular issue, which would perhaps be less involved than coding two completely differing chat interfaces, may be ensure that that anyone joining the server must be invited (by IP address provided they are running the game), or their username 'verified'/'okayed' by the current players/host?<br><br>It depends I imagine, a lot on how the net-play is set up and how many players at a time (maximum in theory) your game is designed around. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
