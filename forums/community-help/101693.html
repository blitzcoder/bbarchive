By providing a song/file to modarchive.org/com you furthermore <b>agree to give anyone who wishes to redistribute your song/file a license to download the song/file from modarchive.org/com and do so</b>, provided it has stayed in its original, unmodified, unbundled form.</i><br><br>there is a page in the mod archives all about being very careful and getting full signed permission from the copyright holder, <i>but that only applies in the absence of any tagged license</i>, particularly the modarchive licence.<br><br>Sooooo, I spent a lot of time chasing permissions when I didn't need to.<br> :/<br><br>Hoooowever, what I found was that some of the composers are slapdash when they submit a tune to the modachives, they just check accept the mod archive licence when in fact they don't hold the copyright in the 1st place.<br>e.g<br><a href="http://modarchive.org/index.php?request=view_by_moduleid&amp;query=53449" target="_blank">http://modarchive.org/index.php?request=view_by_moduleid&amp;query=53449</a><br>phenomenon choir copyright was not owned by the composer of the modachive tune ( it was a cover ) but he's erroneously put the modarchive licence tag on it, the copyright was never fully his in the 1st place. So I can't legally use that song without getting permission also from Micheal v.d.k.<br><br>There's quite a few covers in the archives, in fact I'd say this is one of the main stumbling blocks to look out for if you intend to use tunes 100% legally.<br><br>Also you can't be sure that whoever uploaded the tune and agreed the modarchive licence was the copyright holder.<br>So yeah, even if the modarchive licence is tagged to the tune, you should still try pretty hard to contact the author.<br><br>But.... if you really can't get hold of him, then it is probably a modest defence in court to say you tried hard to contact him but couldn't, so took the mod archive license as valid.<br>As far as I can tell copyright violation is a rampant now as ever since the internet exploded the problem. Chances are if you've made a good effort to contact the copyright holders, failed, but got the mod archive licence, then they won't call you for violation. If they do, I guess it should be ok to explain to them what happened and remove the copyrighted material from your game. But that's just my take on it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
