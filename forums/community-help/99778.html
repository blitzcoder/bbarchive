It runs basically everything that can run on a low-power ARM device. Therefore, the choice of GUI system is largely separate from the fact you're working on the Pi: what matters is which desktop environment and UI system the currently installed OS is running.<br><br>Knowing this, you can then go and find out that if you're using stock Debian, your desktop environment is GNOME, which is built on GTK+; if you're using Raspbian, it's LXDE, also built on GTK+; and in fact most of the popular Linux UIs are built on GTK+. etc. You can use a different toolkit, but your software will then require the libraries from the other toolkit to be installed, which you probably don't want to do on a small device like the Pi for space reasons.<br><br>Using a specific widget toolkit means tying yourself in to those specific UI elements. This is good, because it gives you a very fine level of control over the look of your app - you know at design-time exactly what it will look like and how it will feel; but it also means (as above) the toolkit must be installed on any system where you want your program to run. If you want it to run on Windows, for instance, it will depend on the user first downloading GTK+ for Windows, which is a sticky business. In practice it therefore really means you'd be specifically developing your app "for GTK+-based desktop systems", which might rule out a number of Pi users.<br><br>The other option is to use a GUI framework like FLTK. These normally work by providing a high-level wrapper around system-provided widgets (think MaxIDE). The advantage is that they work across a wide range of systems with minimal dependencies, sine they're designed to work on top of Windows/Cocoa/GTK+ and anything else; and the cross-platforminess is usually small enough to be handled by bundling it into your app. The downside is that you get less fine-grained control over appearance, or to put it bluntly, "it looks equally crap everywhere". You also won't be able to take advantage of any functionality specific to only one target, so you have to be willing to rule some things out.<br><br><br>The difference between these solutions is not really clear cut (yeah they do different things but that's not what you need to worry about right now): it's (partially) an analogue sliding scale between fine-grained control, and portability + ease of use. Same tradeoff you make everywhere.<br><br><br>So to decide where to start, you need to do two things, the same as for any application:<br><br>1) Define what your target is. Your target isn't "the Pi", because "the Pi" could be running a completely incompatible OS (the same way we don't normally develop for "the PC"). You need to assume a basic minimum level of compatibility in the installed environment, which for a hacker's toy is actually quite an important question.<br><br>2) Define what the loosest level of control is that will still let you actually achieve what you want, and then use a library that lets you code at that level.<br><br><br>...That was a very long-winded way of saying you probably want to get started by just reading up on simple GTK+ apps for a generic Linux environment.<br><br><br>Also, I know I'm well into stuck-record territory by now (especially talking to an experienced user), but... save yourself! It didn't have to be this way! You don't need to continue to use C++! If you look at GTK+, for instance, it would be an excellent opportunity to pick up Vala instead (a lovely high-performance C#-like language designed specifically for it).<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2013</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I wondered if my theme was breaking it.. So, I went in, low and behold, it was using "Custom Theme", which, didnt seem very good, so, I changed it to one of the preset ones... And guess what...
