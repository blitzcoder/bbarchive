A single larger widescreen can be convenient to run an IDE on since you can see more of the same line of code without breaking it up across two panels.<br><br>Personally I have dual 19" screens at my office PC, and a single 24" LCD at home. Before I bought the 24" LCD, I had a single 19" LCD at home and tried to use a dual setup there too for a while -- didn't work out at all.<br>I love having the 2 screens at the office, and it makes perfect sense for the work I do there. At home, it was pointless: There were so many tasks (and games) where you could/would only use a single screen, that I wanted to sit straight in front of the primary screen. The secondary screen would therefore be way off to the side, making it even less practical to want to use.<br><br>At the office I have a lot of different stuff open and both screens are sitting side-by-side right in front of me -- but that means that you're always kind of giving a sideway glance at the monitor that you're currently working on. That really doesn't work well for games.<br><br>so personally I defiitely prefer the single larger screen for home use, but  your mileage may vary. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You most certainly also do not have VMs running in the background or multiple open terminal server session windows or command prompts.<br><br>Especially when I'm doing sysadmin/network admin work (which is my job), I find using two or more monitors much more efficient than having just one 30" display in front of me. I've used both setups: My Mac Pro has two 20" Apple Cinema Displays and at my old job we had a 20" iMac with an additional 20" Cinema Display and a Dell Precision Workstation with one 30" Dell display. But given the choice, I'd always choose two 20" screens over one 30" display. I find one screen configurations too uncomfortable for what I'm mostly doing, no matter how big that one screen is. A 30" screen is awesome for working on RAW photos, but for everything else it quickly becomes rather unhandy.<br><br>But that's just me, and each to his own. ;-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

(I'm using all high end stuff, so it shouldn't be an issue of not enough graphics power) We also moved over to Vista and added other hardware at the same time, so It's hard to get a direct comparison though.<br><br>Personally, I really like the 2 screen setup. I put extra menus and my web browser on the right monitor, and then I could work full screen on the left monitor without anything getting in the way. The large single screen feels a bit like going back to what I had before the dual setup, where I always have to shuffle what is on top.<br><br>As I mentioned before, the single setup actually has more resolution, so it's possible to just position things differently on the single screen, but I liked having the physical divider to split things out. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
