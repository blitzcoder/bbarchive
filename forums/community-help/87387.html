Another question, this PC comes with an ATI 4890 GFX card which I believe is a pretty fast card. I know with windows 7 we should be looking at DX 11 cards but the price they are selling this PC at is very affordable considering the high end stuff they putting in it ... so is it worth getting a DX 11 card now?<br><br>Also I have bought Nvidia for a long time whats your opinion of ATI cards? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Have a socket 754 athlon64 3000+ and AGP 7800GS. <br><br>I've used the onboard sound for a longtime, had the xbox audiochip which was very low latency with Nvidias own drivers. But now I'm on windows 7 I'm stuck with realtek drivers which aren't so good and much of the audio processing is now done in software instead of hardware.<br><br>I decided the one thing left for me to try was a new soundcard so I got a refurbished XiFi gamer for $40 from the local store and though it didn't make a huge difference in Risen, it is noticeably smoother in key areas like combat, plus the sound quality is MUCH  better. Previously I had to use SRS sandbox to boost the bass and range of the onboard sound, I installed that now, the XiFi is MUCH better and has quick one click settings for entertainment, games and authoring. Thought it was a bit lame at first, but turned out to be really useful. Especially on an older PC like mine.<br><br>Oh, there are tons of threads about creative drivers in windows 7. Looks like they fixed them in the last 4 months. Runs a treat and so far no problems whatsoever :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I've been using it for years without issues. The only reason I used a dedicated soundcard in my last PC was that the onboard audio only had three outputs which it used for its surround osund, and that there was no plugin to connect the microphone to at the same time... So I used a stand-alone card with 5 ports so I could connect both simultaneously. When I bought my current PC a few years ago I made sure that it had enough onboard sound connectors, and everything has been working great. (Modern soundcards can remap the input/output ports, so if you use surround sound setups some of the ports may function differently than in stero mode)<br>- As far as video is concerned: it varies a little depending on the games you play. I have an ATI 4670 card which plays everything I throw at it (which isn't too bleeding edge, though) -- I'd say just try it, and see if the card holds up for you.  ATI vs. NVIDIA isn't that big a deal -- they both have pros and cons, and after all these years they still go neck-on-neck performance wise. This week one is ahead, next week it's the opposite again.  I've never had problems with ATI myself, and wouldn't hesitate to buy another ATI card. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
