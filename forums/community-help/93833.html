My 2¢:<br>Some people animate their characters very badly but think they're doing a good job; they can't <i>critique</i> their own work, and that's a very important artistic skill needed to achieve production quality - so consider yourself lucky to be noticing that your animation didn't quite reach there yet.<br><br>It's very hard to do convincing animation because there are many subtleties that are missed when you are animating. <br>It comes down to your sense of motion. If your judgement is out of place, you won't get a good animation - sometimes it's hard to get a good sense of motion on things you don't have a clear understanding, so, one of my recommendations is to record (with a digital camera) the motion you want to see, and then go <b>frame by frame</b> in the video seeing which parts of the object move and how much. This is extremely helpful.<br>Once I had to animate a character swinging a sword so I recorded myself doing it, with the exact same <b>speed and body expression</b> I wanted to achieve.<br><br>Make sure to be aware of all the animation principles that some professionals at Disney have listed (the longest description of them are usually the best). The good thing about them is that they make you <b>think</b> about how you'll tackle the problems, they make you look <i>analytically</i> at the motion you're trying to convey; this gives you much better results, and sharpens that sense of critique I mentioned above. They are very important.<br><br>As rare as materials like this can be, seeing experienced people (professionals or not) animate also gives a reference on what you should be doing, because you get to see not only the process but also the result:<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL-vucZAiHE" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL-vucZAiHE</a><br><br>As with modelling, you can always learn something by looking at animated meshes from professional games (even while you play). You'll see what you can do in terms of mesh animation, what solutions the animators and programmers chose. <br>I was especially amazed at how expressive the characters from the Kingdom Hearts series were; seeing the game art in a special viewer I could see that all the models used for the cutscenes were much higher poly than the ones for the gameplay. So things like eyebrows, eyelids and mouth had many nuances of expression possible - this of course due to the bigger polygon count.<br>This sort of experience will also make you realize another important aspect of animating for games: sequences. <br>You need to manage and list all the different sequences every character is supposed to have, and at list mark somewhere (even if in your mind) how these sequences relate to eachother. Don't just open the software and start animating - like with the rest of your game, you need a <b>design</b> on your animation, a plan.<br>What are all the sequences you'll need, what are the character's personality traits or handicaps that would influence his moviments (even if none)? what is the sequence you'll be working on now, etc.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You'll need to sync the two cameras, so you can compare the side and front poses. Once you do that, open up your animation program and use it to position the parts of your model, similar to your body. Might help more? If your really clever, you could attach colored circles to yourself, and get blitz to read the positions of these, each frame and construct a list of data from that. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Some problems: when you walk, the camera will not move with you, so the angle will change. It's ok for things you do stationary, like shooting or jumping up, but walking and running is a problem. You could film from a greater distance, then the angle won't be such a problem, but the resolution will also be much lower. Not only the angle is a problem, but also the size when you walk towards the second camera (human is getting bigger the closer he gets). If you got one of those electrical walk home trainers that are allowing to walk on a spot, this could be a solution to the problem. Or one of those electrical stairways in shopping malls and airports - tho, maybe looks a bit weird if you record the walk of your zombies there...<br><br>For the Synchronitation of the two cameras you can use a slowly blinking flashlight that can be seen by both cameras. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
