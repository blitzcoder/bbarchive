It seems like each time I tried working on a project in XORS3D - some kinda major problem prevented me from continuing.  Little things didnt work correctly, entitybrightness was broke, the shadow system seemed really flakey, adding 2 lights ( even if the 2nd light didnt cast shadow ) would cause some massive graphpic glitches, and tons more. While the Xors3d team seemd to address a few of the problems/bugs I posted - when they ran into one they either couldn't fix or just didnt want to - they wouldn't reply. I quickly got tired of trying to write a project in Xors3d beta form and stopped using it.  Not saying the Xors3d team aren't constantly updating the engine because they are it's just it has a super long ways to go before I would consider it useable/stable and the minor updates it recieves weekly aren't sufficent to deal with the massive problems the engines has. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

One thing I have noticed - particularly with PhysX involved, is that a standalone compiled Xors exe runs much faster than running code in your IDE even with debug turned off. Not sure why.<br><br>I'm currently using it for Tank Universal2. It's true that over the last year there's been a lot of basic bugfixes, but it's been brought up to quite a nice state. If you're looking for a Blitz3d + DX9 solution, this is a viable choice.<br><br>The Xors team do answer queries but can sometimes seem to ignore the odd question that doesn't suit them. No argumen there. Updates for bugfixes are frequent however.<br><br>Having said all that, I'm not stretching Xors abilities by any means - I'm not using shadows, shaders or animated meshes. I have looked into the deferred rendering etc.. but there did seem to be issues (non-shadow casting objects being transparent, shadows overdrawing fullbright surfaces). My game design doesn't call for extra fx like this so it hasn't really been a worry.<br>&lt;edit&gt; looks like the Xors guys are doing something about this as there's been mention of a shadow/post process code rewrite on the way &lt;/edit&gt;<br><br>Really recommend giving it a whirl by downloading the latest beta.<br><br>Regards the samples (if you're talking about code samples), I think the problem is that the Xors team don't update them to work with the latest beta (and possibly last official release version), meaning you can run into compile errors - which is confusing for a newbie. Not the best - but they're a small team I imagine. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Then see if everything works ok.<br><br>Apart from the issues MadJack mentioned above (animated meshes are important, test them out), if you stick to the fixed-function pipeline (i.e: no shaders, only what Blitz3D could do), it's the safest bet with <i>any</i> engine if you want to support the broadest range of systems possible. <br>Fixed-function is gonna be available for a lot of years to come, because even when it's not precisely available in a certain system, the graphics driver emulates it with shaders.
