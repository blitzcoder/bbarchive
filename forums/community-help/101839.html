What I want to do is simple, I want to add a few more wired connections to the other side of my house. I have 2 net gear routers, 1 linksys,  a net gear  5 port network hub, a 48 port Cisco network switch, and a little 5 port Cisco network switch. All of these devices work as each has been part of a LAN setup at one time or another.<br><br>I made my own 250ft Ethernet cable and followed the standard wiring guide for a Cat5E wire. It works great when plugged directly into any computer on the other side of the house. However it has been a major headache t rying to get any of my network devices to show anything other than limited connectivity. The only thing the At&amp;t tech did when he came over was switch my security settings to WEP OPEN much to my disgust. These techs don’t know a damn thing.<br><br>After some research and many sessions of trial and error I came to the conclusion that the signal is degrading too much over the 200+ foot distance. I am able to get any computer (raspberry pi also) working great on the switch if I plug in everything next to the Uverse router. Soon as I move everything into the other room and connect it via the gray networking  cable (the one I made) I get a limited connection. I have been through every firewall setting possible, manually assigned  ip addresses to the devices, and tried every one of my network devices in every configuration imaginable and nothing.<br><br>Just to prove that the switch works I have the 5 port Cisco switch (bastard device) hooked up right beside the Uverse router with a 5 foot Ethernet cable. The raspberry pi is plugged into the switch and it works fine, now the gray cable plugged into it that travels the entire 200foot expanse is plugged in to my Lenovo desktop and guess what? It works!<br><br>This is kind of pointless though because I need the switch on the other side of the house instead of right next to the router. I tried hooking up another switch and router on the other side of the house but I  don’t think you can use 2 switches on the same Uverse router. I really need at least 4 more hard wired connections on the other side of the house.<br><br>Any ideas on what I should do before I take a sledge hammer to all my hardware?<br><br>This is how the current setup is working:<br><img src="http://s13.postimg.org/8qwacw70l/working_setup.png"><br>Obviously I need the switch in the room where the Lenovo is. I'm not 100% sure if the issue I'm having is power related but it seems logical. Why wont a router(with everything turned off) or another switch on the other end spit up the connections? I may need to change something on the Uverse router but At&amp;t has no clue how to solve my problem. I even tried their connect tech division and all I got is "Well it should be working". I was very unhappy with their service and got it refunded.<br><br>This setup also works:<br><img src="http://s30.postimg.org/lukc3lo7z/working_setup2.png"><br><br>This SHOULD work but it doesn't:<br><img src="http://s23.postimg.org/haxl41fwp/notworking1.png"><br><br>I freshly reformatted my Lenovo with Windows 7 just to rule out any spyware related issues. I've tried with and without firewall enabled and also tried setting the computer in DMZ mode. This is driving me crazy! I thought perhaps my gray cable was the culprit but if that was the case it shouldn't work at all. It's and older cable which I have had for years with no issues. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

As you may know, there is a 300 feet limitation to connections that use the copper/twisted-pair Cat5E cables."<br><br> I am only using around 250 feet so I'm not sure if I really need a repeater. The cable works fine when directly plugged into any computer just not with a Hub, Switch, or Router attached. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

One of my favorite toys for this sort of thing is a SLINGLINK.  You might look into it and see if this product is right for you.  It works by running your internet through your house wiring.  As long as you don't have a reverse neutral or a hot ground.  Results may vary of course.<br><br>In any case, I use a couple in my house (although mine is much smaller :).  I have one attached to my router via a short Ethernet cable and plugged into the wall.  If you have a HomePlug ready device, like Dish Network's Hopper 2000, you can simply plug it into the wall and connect to the network.  If you wish to connect a computer or router at the other side of the house, plug in another SlingLink into the wall behind it and connect that to the computer with another Ethernet cable.<br><br>Do not plug the SlingLink into a surge protector or power strip.  Those sometimes lead to undesired results. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Use a switch instead.<br><br>* Using a router, turning off all routing functions, doesn't allways work as intended (this is dependant of individual routers). Some would work as a switch, some would not. If you want the signals just to "pass through", use a switch instead.<br><br><br>Here's an example of a good practice network setup, always set up the router closest to the intake/modem, then use switches for branching.<br><pre class=code>
