The entire system thus far is wired.<br><br>I'd like if possible, to connect the DVR to my network, but it only has an Ethernet port.

The DVR is in range of the router.

A pair of them runs you around $45 or so, at least the US version does.<br><br>These are connectors with an ethernet and an AC power plug. Stick it in a wall outlet, stick the other one in a different outlet near your router, and it will automagically detect the two, typically with a 100mbit connection.  Most of them support additional adapters as well, although they'd share the bandwidth among themselves.<br><br>The catch: both wall outlets need to connect to the same breaker panel. Typically anywhere in a normal house works OK, but if you are in a larger commercial building or have seperate buildings with their own electric distribution panels then you may not be able to communicate.<br>(Note: if you have a single 'power meter' in your house/garage, then there's a good chance they'll work for you)<br><br>(the home plugs work by adding a data stream on top of the standard 50HZ/60Hz electrical waveform on the powerline itself)<br><br>Now, if those are not an option, there is another one: a wireless 'gaming adapter'. Those are a little box that plug into an ethernet port on a device on one side, and use a wifi antenna to connect to your existing wireless network on the other side. first you plug it straight into your network, and it comes with a piece of software that you run on your PC which will detect and configure it for you through a web interface. You tell it your wireless SSID name and password, save, and you can then unplug it and connect it straight to your DVR or gaming system or whatever.<br>The device thinks it uses normal ethernet, but instead it gets captured and streamed over wifi.<br><br>(Of course, depending on the amount of data you're sending/receiving, wireless may not be fast enough for practical use) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

And it is nothing more than a box with a wlan-adapter+chip in it and a cable to link it to an ethernet port.<br>Problem with Wlan: it has a lower range, it is a shared medium, no guaranteed transfer capacity etc.<br><br>My last try with powerline adapters was years ago (short after the introduction of the technique)... we received up to 1Mbit/s speed when connecting over a distance of 3 floors (but same "power panel").<br>Powerline adapters don't like things like Microwaves or other high-usage-elements. So if you like to turn on/off 1000W-elements (vacuum cleaner etc.) it may influence your transfer speed for that period too.<br><br>That is why each room here is connected through normal Cat7-cables. If there is wlan needed, I placed APs. If the Wlan-Range is too high for a good signal, I placed another AP with the same SSID but a differing channel (so devices recognize them as "differing" so they switch as soon as the signal is getting way better - but this is a individual setup option on your devices).<br><br>As you (Gfk) mentioned that the distance is way too difficult to change or to long ... you will have to stay with: Powerline or Wlan.<br>If you have 2 powerline cables between your buildings and one is unused... You can give a try if the isolation is good enough for twisted pair networking over it... but in that case: make absolutely sure nobody will plug "power" on that line :D.<br><br>(not serious:) If everything fails: buy a second DVR,and if you want to view things from DVR A, you plugin DVR B and take DVR A to your home for pluggin it into the TV device you want. <br><br>Ahh...and if you want to stuck with wlan: Think of directional antennas. We replaced that powerline-connection with 2 directional antenna-using APs (configured as Bridge) and received nearly full speed (wlan maximum was 54mbit there, which meant 3.7-4.0MB/s after removal of wlan overhead, newer techniques will achieve some MB more). Such directional antennas cost roughly ~10€, which should be less than 15$ as there are surely more offers in the US for such cheap things). The APs you then have to buy must be able to use the Bridging mode and must have replaceable antennas (you can turn them like a screw and get a standard-connector for such antennas).<br>You could save one AP if your Wifi-Lan-Adapter has the option to replace the antenna. Antenna cable can be up to X metres (you have to google) long, each metre takes away some "power" from the sending signal strength. Depending on the length and loss of power, you can buy a more powerful antenna. I don't know if your country limits the maximum signal strength, here in Germany we have limits we are not allowed to ignore (else we get into contact with some federals :D).<br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

For West-European countries it is normal to have different circuits so that high consuming things like oven, fridge, cleaners... wont cut off the power for other rooms. Lights are often run over "one connection", or multiple rooms share one line (you recognize it if you run high voltage lamps without transformator and one bulb goes out of business ... check what rooms have power afterwards).<br><br>We checked powerlines that day (so years ago...) - they even connected different households as they at some point were connected to the same line (after the "power consume counter") ... Normally it should be not that possible but the walls are not high enough for some bytes to pass :D.<br><br>Wall outlets should be installable. What needs "checked by"-signs from qualified ones in Germany is if you build a house + doing all the electrical things yourself (there the QS-person will come and check if all cables are correctly assembled/connected to the panel - as the panel will "secure" things coming afterwards). Think UK will not differ that much concerning such things compared to Germany.<br><br><br>I do not know the consumer laws in the UK, but just order a pair, try if they connect and if not: send them back (ohhh how fraudulent and badboy-behaving vs the shopowner...).<br>Or take the wlan-directional-antenna-approach (not that expensive... dlink router with bridge ability for 15€, antenna for 10€ and that if needed twice times).<br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
