And remember that because of this, "Publishable" definitely doesn't translate into "will be published" - in fact, there's a very low chance of being published regardless of quality as long as you make unsolicited submissions (the "slush pile").

I do have some questions/comments:<br><br>1.  Do you have an editor?  Doesn't have to be a professional, but you need a good third party to help you edit your work.<br><br>2.  What draft are you on with this story?  Do you have any kind of outline for your flow of events, and conversation?<br><br>3.  I'll ignore the formatting, because I will assume this is a defect of the webpage.  But you really need to work on your sentence structure.  To many sentences with multiple concepts.  Way to many commas.  Your very first paragraph could easily be broken down into a more flowing structure.  Also, this will allow you to expand your description of the situation, and the main character, creatively.<br><br>It is your choice, and the choice of the story. Instead of directly telling the reader these nasty things about Kate in one sentence, you can instead allow the reader to infer this information through her own actions.  This is a long term character.  Someone the reader will want to get to know, and love or hate.<br><br>If your intent is to convey that these are Alfred's feelings, there is better ways that character can present their opinion.<br><br>4. Don't stop writing.  One very important thing to remember is you need to learn to separate your logical programming side from your creative writing side.  These are two very different disciplines and until your mind is trained properly it will reflect in your writing.<br><br>This is one concept that Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clark, and others have talked about at length.  How to seperate the scientific side of writing from the actual creative story telling.  With out making the story seem like it was written by a robot or document specialist.  Isaac Asimov was never really happy with most of his works.  He credited his editor for a lot of his more famous series.<br><br>5.  Read.  Read what you like to write.  You need to learn to how to read with a critical eye.  There are actually not that many different styles of writing that get published.  You need to study the writing techniques and styles of your favorite authors.  Check out the New York Times best selling list and see how those writers convey their stories.<br><br>6.  Tying into #5, short stories are a world apart from full length books.  A short story shouldn't feel like it's trying to cram a whole life's worth of information into a couple paragraphs.  The story is good.  The idea is sound.  You just need some good editing and revision.<br><br>:)<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You only have to convert your material into a format that it is compatible with their stores. It's free to upload your material to both stores and they only charge you for actual sales. It's an awesome opportunity. A lot of authors are doing it, and it apparently works very well for some. Well, at least I have been reading a lot of books lately that are not available in print, only in digital form in the Kindle store, and from a lot of unknown authors. There's a lot of talent out there that no publisher wants to touch because of the involved financial risks. But since this is the year 2011, publishers have lost most of their importance and their power. The same thing that happened to the music industry is now happening to the publishing industry - the Kindle and the iPad open a loot of doors for newcomers.<br><br>So I don't think you should ask if a story is publishable, since you can always publish it yourself (at least in digital form). Writing good books and finding readers for them are the more difficult parts.<br><br>Put your stuff in the Kindle store and post a link here. I'm sure a lot of us will help you boot strap your endeavor by downloading some of your works. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Her eyes, her golden eyes, shine in the light luster of the moon’s glow. Only a sheet covers the rest of her naked body. The breeze softly whispers around the room, the cool of this summer night finally taking hold.<br>    There is a peacefulness about this young woman. A warmth that radiates out into the room. Blissfully it dances with the rhythm of the breeze, touching each wall, and caressing every curve of her innocent form. Effortlessly the worn, tattered air vent comes into play. It stands snugly only inches off the floor. Silently it reminds the young woman it is there.<br>    Quietly she glances at her clock. The glowing red numbers seem out of place here in this dim, cozy little bedroom. They pierce the room with an all to eerie glow, discoloring everything.<br>    Eleven thirty mouths the numbers. Quietly the woman whispers to herself of the apparent slowness of those numbers. An eternity they have been saying eleven thirty. Only seconds more. Hurry and click to eleven thirty-one. Peace will settle into her at eleven thirty-one.<br>    The growing tension of the wait sends her mind backward, past the day's events, past the  previous nights horror. She gladly lets those thoughts fade into oblivion. As if on request her mind settles into the memories of many nights earlier. Curiously she can’t remember how long it has been. That thought quickly vanishes as the replay of those wonderful, gentle memories bloom before her half closed eyes.<br>    Like always, she is blasted from those memories by the First, or at least that is how she has come to know the sound. Often she has sat and tried to remember what the First actually sounds like. But, in the light of full awareness she can never seem to drum up it's harmonics.<br>    As always it is here. Always when she least expects it. Quickly she glares over to her clock, eleven thirty-one. She knew before she even looked. She smiled. Always the First seemed to take her by surprise. Even now it is gone. But she knows it was there, scanning the room. She has come to see the First as a guardian. The caretaker of the others. The First establishes the safety. If all is well then the others usually follow.<br>    Many times she has tired to explain to her friends how the First sounds,  and what it feels like. But the memory never seems to be there. She has called the First a blast of energy and an instant calm. But even with that she is so unsure. The First has never lasted more then a few seconds, that much she is certain. Then, it vanishes and timidly the others come.<br>    Not being a musician she hasn’t ever been able to find a way to reproduce the tones, or even the basic rhythm. Always they are different, but somehow, disturbingly the same. She has come to realize that they are sounds of love. Living entities of vibration soothing her to the soul.<br>    Tonight wasn’t any different. Except for her tape recorder. At least she hadn’t forgotten to set that up. Once and for all she would have proof to her unbelieving friends that the music did come. Each night it came to soothe her. To warm her.<br>    Moments passed without even a whimper. Something was wrong. Peering around the room she noticed it seemed darker then usual. She then noticed the clock. It was off. “Electricity must be off.” she thought to herself. Of all nights.<br>    Calmly she slid out of bed. Throwing on a shirt she walked out into the living room. Glancing out the window she saw nothing except for the faint outline of the other apartment building across the street. The moon even seemed to have gone out. “Brewing storms must have blocked even her gentle light.” she thought.<br>    Walking into her kitchen she felt along the wall. There she found a flashlight. It’s beacon screamed into the night, almost blinding her delicate eyes. Startled by her own actions she giggled. Moving carefully she retrieved some candles from the cupboards.<br>    After lighting a couple candles and snuggling up on the couch she asked herself why she even bothered. “Why not just go back to bed.” But there was no comfort in that empty statement. The music would not come tonight. She had found it strangely unnerving when it didn’t play. She found security in it’s timeliness, and knowing it was there.<br>    All she felt now was a pressing fear. Not really a strong fear. But she still hadn’t become accustom to living by herself in this city. Even though the neighborhood was a good one, she always seemed to get a bit paranoid when things like this happened.<br>    Only one other person lived in this building. He was a secretive man. He was the one that somehow released those comforting tones each night. She hadn’t any idea where he came from. Although she did know his name. At least the name on his mail box. But strangely he didn’t ever receive any mail. Even her land lord had asked about him. But what could she say.<br>    Suddenly she heard the familiar creek of the stairs. He was coming down. As she listened she noticed how gently and calculated his footfalls seemed to be. Momentarily they paused in front of her door.<br>    The knock was almost inaudible. Without thinking she jumped off the couch and scampered to the door. Throwing the lock and unfastening the chain she quickly opened it. A smile and girlish quiver crossed her face as she looked into the candlelit eyes of her neighbor.<br>    He was a slender built man. But that didn’t concern her. His face was that of a gentle, intelligent man. There was a look of concern on that face. But it showed little else.<br>    Calmly he spoke, “Catherine, the power plant seems to have had a major overload because of this unrelenting summer heat. It’s strange how cool it is now. But I suppose that’s because of the growing storm that will be here around two or so.”<br>    His words were soft and gentle. Catherine looked into his eyes. Nothing. She was good at reading people. Especially eyes. But each time she had spoken to this man she seemed to never get anything from his eyes. Except an unnerving and disturbing mix of timid concern.<br>    Just as gently he continued, “I hope I didn’t awaken you. If you need anything I’ll be upstairs. I’ve got my small generator from the roof going. If you need power for anything I can pipe some down this way.”<br>    Catherine looked at him, growing affection lofted through her, “John, thank you. Would you like to come in?”<br>    What was she saying? John looked at her with slight embarrassment. Averting his eyes back to hers he quickly said, “Thank you. But you're not really dressed for visitors are you?” A warm smile crossed his lips.<br>    Realizing what little she had on Catherine blushed a deep, bright red. Even in the dim light of John’s lantern she noticed that her shirt wasn't doing much for covering anything. She laughed, “I'm sorry. I completely forgot. Just a moment.”<br>    Turning quickly she dashed to her bedroom. “Come on in.” She hollered to him as she darted around the corner. John noticed to himself how beautiful a woman she was.<br>    Back in her bedroom she couldn’t keep from laughing at herself. If it was a freebie that he was wanting then she realized she had just made it too easy for him. She looked at herself in the mirror. There was just enough light from the half obscured moon for her to see that he had just gotten a perfect look at her legs, not to mention other parts down there that she wished were more in shape. Especially now.<br>    “Not that there is anything wrong with my behind.” she thought. Just a bit more firmness would be nice. She then glanced at her shirt. At least that was obscuring what was there. Besides, she liked her upper body. At least something on her was close to perfect. Throwing on her old sweats she hurried back into the living room.<br>    John was there sitting on the couch. His lantern burned brighter now and she saw that he had brought a small cooler with him. Going around the couch she sat down beside him.<br>    Softly, more because the quiet of the night seemed to call for it, she spoke, “I’m sorry John. I hope you don’t think I’m some kind of...Well you know...” She blushed slightly as her companion quietly smiled.<br>    He looked at her. Always in the eyes. She wasn’t sure if he was still embarrassed, uninterested, or just shy. But she took comfort in knowing that he had at least shown the courtesy not to stare. Still smiling she noticed how his words seemed to come easy, and natural, “That's ok. It’s my fault for not giving you fare warning that I was coming down.”<br>    Catherine realized what an attractive young man he appeared to be. Even in the dim light she could tell he meant what he said. She knew without knowing that he was a kind, and gentle man on the inside. Now the nervousness set in. She wanted to kick herself for that. Why was it that she could never seem to stay calm when so close to someone like this.<br>    Shifting around a bit he made himself more comfortable. Still keeping a tad distance between them he turned so he could more easily look into her face. “I’ve been meaning to formally introduce myself, but, oh well, excuses, excuses, is all I can come up with for now. Not all of them being rational I must admit.”<br>    His words danced around her. It was like his music she thought. She had no doubt now that he was the creator of that beautiful music. The thought occurred to her that she should ask him about this music, “John, how do you produce the music that I hear each night?”<br>    He looked away. She had caught him off guard. She was surprised by this, he didn’t seem to be the type to show things like that. Never before had she ever surprised him with anything. But never before had she asked him any real personal questions.<br>    Everything up to that point had just been a scant hello in the hall, or her introducing herself when she moved in months ago. She thought to herself that he was in some respects correct. He hadn’t formally really introduced himself, this would be the first real conversation they had ever had.<br>    Quickly she continued, “If you would rather not talk about it I understand. I have a friend who plays piano, but only when she thinks no one else can hear her. Sort of like my singing I guess.”<br>    “No, that’s not it.” He quakingly began. He remained somewhat calm, although he still wasn’t really looking at her. “You see, no one has ever asked me about it before. No one besides you has ever heard it.” He slowly looked over her entire face before he continued.<br>    Glancing back to his hands he slowly, steadily proceeded, “Catherine, until tonight I had only seen you from afar. This may make you uncomfortable but,” He looked at her now, seriousness in his face, but still strangely that look of loss didn’t leave his eyes, “you are an attractive and intelligent young woman. I've heard a couple of your lectures at the local school. Brilliant is all I can say.”<br>    Pausing he seemed to be waiting for something, not getting it he continued, "I've been working with the music, as you call it, for some time now. But it never had shape, or form. Somehow seeing you the first time, hearing your voice, it changed. Now I have somehow accomplished the form, the shape."<br>    Again he paused, but as before he continued. A slight smile crossed his face as he began, "I'm not really sure why. But the music seems more beautiful then it ever did before."<br>    Then, as if on queue she heard a quite murmur from her bedroom. Surprise over took her. A long, happy smile came into her eyes, and crossed her face. "John, is that your music?" she asked him, already knowing the answer.<br>    He looked at her for a moment, puzzled. "You know, it sounds much clearer then I ever imagined. I was never real sure how it sounded down through the vents of this old house. If you'd like to get a real sense of how it sounds then your welcome to come up, and listen."<br>    She thought for only a moment. Running into the bedroom she grabbed her tape recorder. Slowly the music rolled around the room. It was if a dozen small fireflies were buzzing around the room with small instruments. The notes came from every wall. Every corner was filled with soothing, gentle music. Carefully she sat down on her bed.<br>    There were so many beautiful sounds tonight. Many she hadn't heard before. The rhythm was much gentler, more caressing then ever before. She couldn't help but feel calm and unnerved. All the stress of the last week was slowly being stripped away. Only the music remained in her thoughts, only the handsome man that made it all possible.<br>    Slowly she laid herself down in the bed. Carefully she closed her eyes and listened. The music seemed closer when her eyes were closed. It seemed less afraid, and more vibrant.<br>    Moments later the whole room seemed filled with even more individual players. Each one different, but all more or less playing the same theme. She could feel a slight brush across her face as a note or two danced closer. How alive they all seemed. They reminded her of a spring day. They reminded her of how it felt to be a child and lie in the tall spring grass.<br>    The sky above looked clean. There were no clouds, only the deep blue of the sky. The sun was there. Bright and warm. It's light played through the budding of the trees. She thought to herself how fun it would be if her friends could be here now, listening to the music of spring, hearing the notes, feeling the rhythm.<br>    But they were gone. They were not real friends. They did not believe she was hearing such wonderful music from the apartment upstairs. How handsome a man she had just came to realize that he is. How now, he was sitting in her living room, waiting to take her to the source of this magical music.<br>    "Oh no!" she shouted to herself. Lifting her eyes she looked at the clock. It was there, flashing. There was the normal glow from the window, the normal glow of early morning. Jumping from the bed she ran into the living room. No one was there. She had fallen asleep. He had let himself out.<br>    In her hand was the tape recorder. She had even forgotten about that, again. Looking down at it she noticed that it had not been turned on. That wasn't a very big surprise. Somehow, someday, she'd have to find a way to record this wonderful music. Someday she'd prove to her friends that it was there.<br>    Irritatedly the phone rang. Without thinking she answered it. "Hello." She said. She wasn't sure what time it was, but she knew she wasn't in the mood to talk to anyone.<br>    "Hey girl, did you get your music recorded last night?" Came the sarcastic voice from the other end. "Or did the short power outage scare it away?" The voice laughed. It was cold, and cruel.<br>    She looked at the phone. She looked at the tape recorder. Silently she set the tape recorder down, thought about last night, how she'd finally sort of really met the man who made the music, and said, "I don't want to here about it."<br><br>:) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

As I said, I originally wrote this work in my youth.  I was around 16 when I wrote this piece.  You know, when the hormones are flaming and the thesaurus is your best friend?  ha ha.<br><br>Anyway, back then I did most my creative work on an old manual typewriter.  We didn't have home computers back then.  I can see what I can do to get the entire piece into the computer and email it too you. You would do yourself a greater favor by reading Garth Nix's Abhorsen series.  Lireal is my favorite, don't know why, just is.  It's actually the last book in the series, but oh well.<br><br>Are you going to college?<br><br>Do you have the ability to setup a forum on your website?  Or is this just a blog site?<br><br>I've racked my brain, but I can't remember the answer.  There is a free service on the net somewhere of professional editors/educators that will read your material and offer you technical advise.  Might be worth checking out something like that.  Also, if you have any chance to get into a writing club that would be helpful as well.<br><br>I've not done any searching on the subject, but in this day and age there has to be writing clubs on the internet.  If not, then maybe that's your million dollar project?  :)  If your not buying, or subscribed to the magazine "Writer's Digest", do so.<br><br>A place to possibly look for more information for new writers is "fan fiction" sites.  I know the Harry Potter realm has a huge fan fiction base. (As well as Star Trek, Buffy, Angel, etc.) Look up some of these sites and see if you can find forums or groups that can help you in your writing.<br><br>Your in a delicate phase of your writing at this time. You really need hard-hitting technical advice and help from someone who can justifiably put your work on the chopping block.  You can't do this alone.  Any successful writer will tell you this.  Steven King wrote a lot of crap before he came into his own.  And he has even admitted that he still writes crap from time to time.  But it is part of the process.  In the end a twenty page short story can be the hardest project you may ever work on your entire life.<br><br>Look up Hugo award winning authors and read their short stories.  Then, go back and examine the works from the technical point of view.  It can take years to define your own voice.<br><br>As far as professional editors?  Well if you were to actually find one that would work with you, don't expect to pump out a short story or novel in three drafts.  More like 50.  The real editing process is harsh, sometimes cruel, and definitely a pain in the ass... unless your just a genius. :)<br><br>Don't know if you read Tom Clancy, but he's one of those "genius" writers that doesn't actually write.  ha ha.  He actually "thinks" his books, then dictates them to his secretary who actually does the writing.  There is a famous interview of him on 60 Minutes if you can find it.<br><br>Sorry, I got the rambling bug... :)<br><br>:)<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
