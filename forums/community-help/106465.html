I do code in C++ but I like to learn other easier tools for game making also. My reason is because I'm still getting things flowing in my brain like tile collision in C++ Allegro 5 and this and that and so on. I have no problem with learning two things at the same time. However, I installed Game Maker and even though It is insanely easy It still takes some time devotion (not that I have a problem with that). Furthermore I relized that perhaps blitzmax would be more worth it. This is because I have prior experience in BASIC. Does any one no that book Programming Video Games For Kids by Johnathan S. Harbor? I read it, and found some tutorials online also on QBASIC and QuickBasic 4.5. I also had little experience with Atari BASIC, which was insanely easy. I am starting to think perhaps I should give BlitzMax a try! But as it says can you really make a game on windows machine and port it to mac and Linux? If so then I that's one point for Blitz because Game Maker only has windows exporter. (I will not pay money to make games to other platforms). What do you guys think? I actually have blitz 3D but I have to learn blender first and want to try things with 2D before I move on. So Which do you guys think is best? Personally although Blitz Max is probably better for me I still want to here from you guys... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You need to approach it as something new in order to get the best from it.<br><br>BlitzBasic (the language that powers Blitz3D and BlitzPlus) isn't really BASIC either, but it has a few points of similarity. BlitzMax has no connection to BASICs of the past at all, which is why it isn't named as one.<br><br><br>BlitzMax is also more of a general-purpose language (like C++) than a game making toolkit. The graphics framework it comes with is quite barebones (e.g. BlitzMax solves the problem of getting your head around tile collision insofar as there are neither tiles nor collisions builtin). If you want fast results, you'll really need to import an actual game engine, the same as you would in any language. But using the engine from BlitzMax might be more fun than using the same engine from C++. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Creating 3D games in this language is takes (still a long time) but shorter than using OpenGL and c++. The reason I chose Blitz 3D over Unity is that I prefer just straight coding my games. NO EDITOR. NO DRAG AND DROP. NO NOTHING JUST STRAIGHT CODE. Anyone else feel this way? Although I am going to go to Japan when I'm older so I will eventually learn Japanese, It probably wont be for game dev. I simply love Japan what else can I say lol.(:     And yes hard coal you are right. I took one look at the tuts that came with blitz max and BOOM. BASIC baby! I also like Blitz 3D because of its nice documentation (especially from great community members like you peeps). However, I still got to go through modeling and animating and mapping tuts for blender so I can take use of the software. Anyway feel free to share how you got into your blitz research language! If not then see you on another post perhaps! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
