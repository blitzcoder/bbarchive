(Other Blitz languages may be acceptable, but there are certain requirements for these games that I'm not sure are supported by the other Blitz languages.  Maybe you can tell me when we speak.)  Graphics and audio can be provided, but placeholder graphics/audio can be used for the time being.  Work can start ASAP.

For example, if you get 25% of the way through, he would probably we willing to pay 25% of an agreed upon fee.  Hopefully, at that point, you can show that it is 25% functional.  :)  I'd have to clear this through him, of course.<br><br>I really don't know what price he is willing to pay, as he hasn't told me.  He didn't want to quote something too high, nor too low.  If you are truly interested, please send me a quote via email, and I'll pass it along to him.

Although I'm not sure where you are going with them...<br><br>1. I don't know what the legality of online gambling is in any country.  If you are saying that you can go to jail for gambling online, then maybe you shouldn't gamble online!  :)  Seriously though, I am assuming that you are referring to some kind of risk by programming these games?  Well, to put your mind at ease: (1) Programming games, whether they are to be used for (assumingly) illegal online gambling or not, is of no risk to you as it is not illegal to PROGRAM those games, as far as I know!  (2) Once you are done the programming, complete rights to the program will be transferred from you to my client purchasing your game.  (3) You are only asked to program these games to run in a closed system.  (4) These games are not intended to be used online.  They are going to be used in a legal brick-n-mortar Internet Cafe business.  But who knows what my client will do with these programs in the future.  He can do whatever he wants since he will own them.<br><br>(2) My client doesn't care that the market is over-saturated with these kinds of games.  Do you?<br><br>I'll answer whatever emails you send me.<br>Thanks!<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Exactly what I was getting at.  I know it is not illegal to PROGRAM the games, it is just illegal to send money over a wire for purposes of gambling.<br><br>2. For this point, we can argue until we're blue in the face about this one.  But what I'm trying to get at is that every casino has a slot machine, poker machine, or blackjack machine.  Why waste time building another with different graphics, when it is possible to program something different.  Something that the regular gamblers have not seen.<br><br>I have a suite of games based on numbers, a deck of cards, and games many adults played as a kid.  (Those adults born before the computer revolution that is, before the era of video games brainwashed their little minds that there is more to life than an Windows machine and a joystick)<br><br>I'll let you in on three of them!<br><br>1.  A number based game.  Wild guesses.  The computer thinks of a number between 1 and 10.  You get three  attempts to guess that number with decreasing prize amounts.  EG gameplay.  You place a bet of $3.   If you guess the number correctly on your first try, you win $3.  IF you guess incorrectly, you get a second chance.  This time, if you guess correctly, you win $2.  IF not, you get a third and final chance. This time you only $1 if you guess the number or you lose your bet entirely.  This game is I say 90% completed.  I just need to work out some bugs.<br><br>2. Two child-like games. Scissors , Rock, Paper.  If you remember the rules of which beats which, this is simple.  You engage the computer in a battle.  You simply place a bet if you pick the object that beats the computer object. I believe that the rules are rock breaks scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock, so if you pick paper, and the computer picks rock, you win, otherwise you lose if the computer has picked scissors. Of course, in a tie, your bet is returned to you.  I haven't started programming this one yet.<br><br>3.  Coin Toss.  This is as simple as it gets.  The computer tosses a coin.  You simply place a bet and call heads or tails.  If you're correct, you win. If not you lose.  I haven't started this one, yet, but how much programming effort can this one take.  These latter two also has a feature that I wish to keep secret until I can get the feature patented.<br><br>I know I have the talent to program these games.  What I need is a distributor, a Steve Jobs (RIP) type of personality that makes a person or company want to pay for these ideas.  And of course time to program them.  (I also need to spend less time on those adult sites, but that's another problem)<br><br>Email me if you're interested.<br>cjw_clients@... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
