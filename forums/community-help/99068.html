There is an ungodly amount of manufacturer's tripe also preinstalled and I just cannot seem to get rid of it all.  Startup time is awful and no matter what I do it doesn't get any better. My internet connection is poor whereas it's fine on every other PC in the house.<br><br>So to the point - the serial in the battery compartment is for Win7Pro.  My Windows 7 CD is the Home Premium edition.  I fear I already know the answer, but will the serial number work (in whatever form) with the CD I have?<br><br>Buggered if I'm buying yet another Windows licence. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There may be more to it, though, so best to read up... or just try it and see what it says!<br><br>Alternatively, assuming you've uninstalled all you can manually uninstall, use Sysinternals' AutoRuns to uncheck the startup programs you can identify. Stick to the top four or five sections in the Everything pane (don't touch filters, protocols, installed items, etc) and just untick the programs you can identify.<br><br>There's also <a href="http://www.pcdecrapifier.com/" target="_blank">this</a>, which is supposed to be good for this sort of thing (not tried it) and things like CCleaner to tidy up.<br><br>EDIT: Apparently you have to build a modified ISO to do the all-versions thing...<br><br>I'd go with uninstall/AutoRuns myself!<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

When I first installed it, it asked for the serial number. It uses this to determine what version of windows you own. There is an option to install -without- a serial (which gives you a 2-week trial period). If you pick tha toption and skip the serial, it brings up a screen asking you to select what edition of windows to install (Home premium, pro, ultimate, etc., with a bold warning to make sure that you have a proper key for the selected version, or you won't be able to unlock it with your key once the 2-week trial ends.<br><br>Given that the PRO disc gave me the option to pick home as well as the higher 'ultimate' edition, I'd say that there is a good chance that your Home disc may contain pro as well. As blitz-support mentioned, there IS a difference between the 32-bit and 64-bit media.<br><br>(Windows 7 also allows you to use the same media for corporate &amp; retail keys, unlike windows XP where you can't use a corporate key on OEM media and vice-versa) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
