 field PropertiesStr$
 field Pickable

</pre><br>those would be the list of items for the map<br>and of course have also one list of items per container and one list of items per character.<br><br>Since it is apparently fast to split a string made of different parts separated by symbols (on my low end computer, it takes around 0.06ms to split a string made of 6 parts (6 different properties, i apparently don't need more)), and since this procedure would happen only when creating characters/containers/items or when a container/character is searched or when a property is read, i say why not, this would simplify my code a lot... (i would just have, for each kind of item, to code a procedure to get a property from a "properties string", and a procedure to set a property in a "properties string"<br><br>What do you think ? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

One of the pluses of this method is that you can have unusual items that cross over multiple types of category which the other two types of storage are less easy to do this for.<br><br>For example you might have an armour that can be activated like a magic ring and the same item class can handle both depending on the flags set on it...whereas a specific armour class and a specific ring class would not allow this....same with a property string. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So the "groups" have stubs like "canConsume:int()" and "Consume:int()" which get filled by objects which actually can get consumed.<br><br>It depends on what you pay attention to:<br>- reusable code (so things are put into their own importable files - dependencies shouldn't become circular)<br>- low memory footprint (properties VS getter-methods)<br>- cpu usage (properties vs getter-methods)<br>...<br><br><br>Best thing is surely to use the "group"-style. Which could also be replaced with "components".<br><br>To avoid direct linking of "possibilities" you need to use "constants" (like "FUNCTIONALITY_CONSUMABLE:int=1") and define the components to what functionality they have.<br>Then in your item you have a "DoUse(functionality:int)" which runs all the components being available for the given functionality.<br><br>That way each item could have whatever functionality it needs. <br>Disadvantage: information retrieval ("return all supported functions of that item") is done on a dynamic way (asking all components and sum-ing them up). Ok,you could cache this (on each component-modification), but this increases memory usage.<br><br>Basic item information (id, GetTitle(), GetDescription(), GetSprite()...) should be stored as properties because they are often used and this saves processing power.<br><br>Next to this, I would use a different approach for certain items. Quest Items would imho not mix with other "different approach" items. In that case you could have a "TQuestItem extends TItem" and directly define some properties there.<br>Of course you run into trouble if you want to use "questitem properties" in another type too. If so, you extract all these properties into a new "group/component" and add them as you did with the others (dunno, the functionality could be "handOutToNPC" or so).<br><br><br><br>Extracting functionality into components also allows for easy information sharing. So all "magic rings" could share the same "use-cooldown".<br><br><br>Having "uber-classes" (containing properties for everything and the whole world) leads to non-maintainable code if the properties are not just "int" or "string". Like already mentioned - it will lead to "circular dependency" somewhen (a property wants to know about another item... so it must import "TItem" which it cant because it is already imported itself from "TItem"). Having these "all you can eat"-classes is dangerous for "project evolution".<br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
