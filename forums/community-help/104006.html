So.....I want to be sure this doesn't happen - which was a real bummer last time when all of a sudden I noticed activity in my game suddenly ceased (thus losing players as well) -- worse still it happened during the odd hours of the morning so I had no idea about it until I was awake the next day - several hours afterwards....<br><br>from Matt <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I went with KnownHost, and I've been with them now for over a year.<br><br>It's a huge difference in speed over shared hosting, and their support is really good. I've never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for a response, and the only time I ever had any downtime was when GMail decided to file their invoice under Spam and I didn't pay it. Even then, they had it back online in the wee small hours of a Monday morning, as soon as my invoice was paid.<br><br>If you're going to use a VPS, I would say the two features you want are support and an SSD. This isn't shared hosting, so you *will* need support at some time, and quality counts. If you're going to pay VPS prices, it doesn't make sense, in my view, to use a hard drive. SSD makes a big difference.<br><br>Read around for reviews. I'm sure LiquidWeb and Knownhost aren't the only good services out there, but there sure are a lot of bad ones. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
