It doesn't have those "You want to buy Pro?" popups and registration is needed only once a year.<br><br>But lately I think most virus scanners are lame because they don't check in the Windows registry if stuff boots up from temp directories when booting Windows. And the few Viruses which entered my drive by own mistake downloading malicious crap all worked the same way booting up from the Windows registry. My fix is getting those manually out of the registry and remove the files where they are located and do a restore to the day before once I deactivated the virus. Just need to reboot a few times during these steps.<br><br>And if they can't even do a single thing like that it's a waste of CPU and HD space and power.<br><br>Also some virusscanners tend to remove executables that are harmless, thanks again to those virusscanners that made me redownload some of my games on Steam.<br><br>And some of the payed versions are even worse, like Norton...

So you should not be surprised when it turns out that for example avast is also used as a backdoor by security institutions and probably also by hitech criminals. That's a problem of all Firewalls and Antivirus Apps. You have to decide: trust them or unplug you machine from the internet. Personally I have unplugged my workstation machine. Only a notebook that acts as a web terminal is connected. I really have a slight suspect that there are sometimes "people" in my machine. No desaster, since the data on the hd is not very sensitive. However, if you don't give Avast Web-access, then your browser won't download anything. (Need to give access to AvastSrv and AvastWebSrv). And it is really accessing the web a lot, eg. addresses like "savebrowsing.google.com" etc.<br><br>Personally I'd prefere an Antivirus App that does not access the web as long as I don't hit the "update virus definition file" Button. Anyway.<br><br>From the point of view of a secret service it is of course only logical to integrate some secret features in popular antivirus software and also and probably especially in firewalls. Call me paranoid, I guess the truth is even worse. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
