I used to use dell but I got fed up with the customer service and crashes and switched to HP and Lenovo which are both great except this one problem which is also persistent in my old half dead dell machine. :(  So I was thinking, using 100% CPU on both CPU's for extended periods of time could possibly just wear it out over time and make some of the wires and microscopic components go bad which would cause the crashes for sure.  If the iolo doesnt work then I guess this must be the problem.  Thanks again. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Fragmented drives shouldn't causes crashes but they will cause slowdowns, so defragging is a good idea.  Other than that ... next time you have crashes, run System Mechanic again and see if the crashing continues.
