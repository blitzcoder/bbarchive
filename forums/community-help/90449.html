Current i3's and i5's (and the quad i7) are on LGA1156 which is being phased out for LGA1155, which is right around the corner.

But since ATI is quite cheap anyway, you could buy an 64-bit ATI instead. 32-bit GPUs are just ridiculous for modern VR simulations as they can't handle any decent Z-buffer ranges. Besides, if 64-bit floats act like on 64-bit CPUs, they would be 5 times faster than 32-bit floats on a 64-bit GPU. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Like I said, there are also other combinations possible, like turbo boosting half of the cores instead of just one (that would make no sense if it was only about heat suspension, as with the one core boost you still get multi-core abilities). And besides, you can't even buy high clocked single cores anymore, so that's as good as it gets. And this sentence from Intel's website is pointing out the key aspect of the turbo boost technology (I mean you can always cool down your PC with liquids if you want, but you can't just add more cores): <div class="quote"> The maximum frequency of Intel® Turbo Boost Technology is dependent on the number of active cores.  <br></div>http://www.intel.com/technology/turboboost/ <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

What it essentially does is manage core speed based upon a combination of load and TDP (Thermal Design Power). TDP essentially provides a budget for the amount of power and heat being distributed to the CPU. If cores aren't needed Turbo boost will clock them down and use the extra power budget to speed up the active cores.   <br><br>Intel has implemented Turbo Boost on its Core i7 and Core i5 CPUs<br>This is all handled by the operating system and works well. Unless you are specifically using multithreaded applications there will inevitably be a core or two going unused. It allows end users to get more out of their CPU for the single threaded programs that dominate their day to day use, and means that when programs actually are multithreaded that they will get the most out of the CPU. <br></div> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
