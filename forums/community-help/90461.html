I heard that KVM switches knacker the picture quality a bit...?  <br></div><br><br>VGA KVM's do add some slight signal degradation, which <i>can</i> make the resulting image look slightly blurry. Quality varies, and it also depends on the quality of your cables (better shielded VGA cables = crisper signal). I've come across some VGA KVM's that introduce some slight ghosting, and others that look very good. I don't know if VGA is even an option for mac anymore, though - haven't they all switched to displayport / DVI by now?<br><br>DVI KVM's do not affect the quality since it's a digital signal, but they are much more expensive... Plus really finicky, it seems like -- most of the ones I've seen get pretty poor reviews. If you do go the DVI KVM route, make sure that you get one with some actual brains in it. The older / low end ones can have a host of issues when the two machines don't run identical resolutions, or when power saving kicks in one one of the displays, etc.<br>It's real easy to buy a lemon there, so make sure that you're getting one with good ratings.<br><br>Another potential option: If you have a monitor that allows multiple input methods such as both VGA and DVI, you may be able to connect both simultaneously, and switch between the two by simply by selecting the other input on the monitor itself.<br>(This may not work properly though -- for example, I've come across Acer monitors that would auto-detect a signal on the DVI port every five seconds, which meant that in DVI mode everything worked perfectly, but in VGA mode every five seconds the screen would blank out for a second... Unless I unplugged the DVI cable, then VGA worked just fine. Kind of annoying. Most monitors work just fine with both hooked up, though.) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
