Basically, create a clean install, patch up windows, install all your programs you need. Then ghost your Hard Disc. Then whenever you need to reinstall, just copy across the ghost copy, restoring everything, saving you the hassle of reinstalling all your programs (the ones you use all the time at least)<br><br>Would this work? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I dont bother with Norton though I use the following ( only works for windows XP though )<br><br><br>This website has everything you need<br><a href="http://www.runtime.org/peb.htm" target="_blank">http://www.runtime.org/peb.htm</a><br><br>You download the Windows BART PE, wich will take your windows xp cd or xp install media and then create a cut down version of XP that can boot and run from CD without installing XP to any writable media. (uses ram for all operations)<br><br>Before you have BART PE create the CD download all the plugins available for it and add them to the CD application list. (instructions on the site)<br>Most important plugin is the DriveImage plug, but you will need them all , as some let you browse USB drives, ect.<br><br>Now, you can use another program they have to make the ghost image and store it on usb media or external hd.  The ghost program is called DRIVEIMAGE XLM , its a stand alone program for ghosting.  <br><br>So, restore is simple. You boot with the CD you made, run the driveimage plugin and browse to your image file that you have on usb or external hard drive, and it will restore the HD pretty fast.. My 80gig drive restores in about 10 minutes. <br><br>Norton is cool too, but this software is free. <br>Heres a youtube video instruction as well. Again this only works for XP, not Vista.<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0reKK2ASEaU" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0reKK2ASEaU</a><br>the video tutorial places the ghost image on a seperate partition of the same drive, I prefer a seperate media all together, such as usb stick or external drive.   I also back up my images on CDs for archiving. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

On top of that Windows may deactivate itself if several hardware components change on it.<br><br>If you are looking at moving your images cross different computers with different architectures / hardware components, you'll probably need something like Acronis True Image which has the ability to do a platform neutral restore where the backup is generalized and has the ability to restore onto completely different hardware.<br>A straight bit-by-bit copy like most imaging software uses will often fail to restore a working copy of windows when you do the restore to non-identical hardware. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This command lets you copy a whole drive to a file and back. Boot from the live cd and run it to copy your drive. Combine it with netcat and you can even do it over your LAN. :) Just open the command line and type "man dd", then read the instructions for how to use it (note, it is possible to wipe your whole drive with it too...so you want to actually read the manual for this one).<br><br>Puppy Linux is a very nice live distro that once booted runs entirely from RAM. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You'd still need to do that regardless, or you'd never be able to move from one computer to another one since there's a high likelyhood that your restore won't work on different hardware... Plus you'd need to do a fresh application install anyway if you want to switch operating systems in the process, or go from 32 to 64 bit.<br><br>One problem with images, is that in reality you won't create them very often -- you're bound to lose months of changes, if not more. What I've taken to doing:<br><br>1) I made an image after I installed the OS, downloaded all current patches, and installed my usual slew of applications.<br>2) burned the image to DVD, just in case<br>3) I keep a 'master' folder with installers of every single program that I run on my PC, including their serial numbers<br>4) Periodically I burn that master folder to DVD(s)<br><br>With that, I can do a fairly quick major disaster recovery (the initial HD image for my computer), and install the missing applications easily. Having a single resource for all the apps I use also beats trying to dig up who knows how many CD's if you do need to do a complete reinstall - it's all right there.<br><br>As with any system, the trick is to make sure you stay on top of it, though. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
