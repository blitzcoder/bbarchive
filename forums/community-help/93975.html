This means the source has to be readable to the web browser to be run. By extension anything your web browser can read so can you. JavaScript can be embedded in a page directly, or (as Jesse indicated) the page can link to a resource file containing the code. If it's embedded just look at the page source. If it's linked then look at the page source and find the link (again as Jesse indicated) and visit that file to take a look.<br><br>Not sure exactly what you're doing but javascript to create a side bar sounds less than optimal to me. Reasons:<br>If someone has JavaScript off (still happens a lot) or no JS support, you have no side bar and presumably your site's navigation is crippled.<br>As with all things on the web, every browser is different. You're going to have to test that code in (minimally) IE (preferably a number of versions from 6 - current with and without compatibility mode), firefox, chrome, safari and then possibly Opera etc etc etc. And expect problems...<br>Why not use HTML? No code problems, no interpretation problems, far less testing (HTML actually works these days now that IE 6 is a dinosaur). Also less to load so the page loads faster.<br>Why not use CSS? Like HTML it's far more likely to work, far easier to make, and far easier to test (though you do need to test more than plain HTML). It's also much easier to make large revisions in future, and the user's browser can modify it on the fly as needed for their user experience. AND it can pull off a lot of the tricks you're likely to be wanting from javascript...<br><br>Just my thoughts :0) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'll try to explain it with a little bit more detail:<br><br>JavaScript is an embedded computer language built into most browsers.<br>Java is a plugin interpreter for a different computer language similar to JavaScript but not the same.<br>Java works in similar fashion as Flash you need to download the plugin to get it to work in your browser. <br>JavaScript can be embedded in the HTML file you just have to tell the browser that it's Javascript with the "&lt;script&gt;" and "&lt;/script&gt;" tags. you can program it just like you do any other language. with; variables,loops, and if statements. the code can also be written in a text editor just like HTML saved with the extention "js" it can then be access by using the script tags in the html page. <br><br>the source you are looking for in the page you are trying to edit is the script by the name "sibebar.js" and that is the left side bar. To look at it all you have to do is load it into your browser like this:<br><a href="http://www.spanishvillageart.com/sidebar.js" target="_blank">http://www.spanishvillageart.com/sidebar.js</a> <br>if you have direct access to the server's user account for the page, you can also download the js file, edit it with a text editor, and upload it back up to the server and the changes will take effect immediately as when you are writing html code. One thing to note with JavaScript is that the browser will not report any errors with it. It will just stop running the script or that specific part.<br><br>note:<br>the right side bar is just plain html code with CSS and some imbedded JavaScript. you might want to consider placing it there. look for the section "&lt;!-- WAS PICTURE --&gt;" and that is where the right sidebar start.<br><br><br>I am wondering.
