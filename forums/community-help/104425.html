I've realised that the name isn't very good, most high end gaming products seem to have cool names and I don't think my name quite cuts the mustard. What do you folks think? <br>I'm also very temped to rebrand to Hydra Game Manager/ Hydra Game Hub. I think most game products tend to be based on ferocious animals and I quite like the mythological Hydra and it fills the ferocious category.<br>Again what do you think? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The product is done (although I continuously work on it from time to time) but I've never really marketed it very well (or very much) so before I put the effort into selling it I want to get the branding correct and a good name. Firstly I need to get a good logo but obviously I need to settle on a decent brand name first. <br><br>The name that I first chose (the working title) was Photon Game Manager but as the program has gone through several rebuilds from the ground up (V2,V3,V4) using different Blitz products over the years, there are some reviews floating around that give mediocre scores because they are reviewing the free old versions. This is reason 1 why I would like a name change.<br><br>Reason 2 is that as Adam said Photon Game Manager is a bit of a mouthful. <br><br>I guess it might be wise to rebrand just as 'Photon' to keep my old brand but make it less of a mouthful. I'm mainly posting on here just to see what other people think as I usually make the wrong decisions :)<br><br>The only advertising I have done is a youtube video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKSDIxzU7f8" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKSDIxzU7f8</a><br><br>TL;DR: Product already released but badly advertised. Thinking about name change before putting effort into advertisement. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Reduce its prominence in the logo, start referring to it by the simple name only in writing. Later maybe remove it altogether.<br><br>Keeping your existing brand if you already have a completed product is likely to be more valuable than any new name. Just shore it up a bit by trimming the fat (in general, good names avoid technical cruft words like "game manager" and are pure abstracts - the technical words contribute absolutely nothing to your image and are pure wasted space). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
