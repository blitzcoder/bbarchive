That is what github issues is for. Even if you open up or put back the bug reports forum, I don't see how it can help "fix" any problem or new bugs that needs to be reported. skidracer's moving it to archive makes more sense.<br><br>This is like the case of munch's openb3d wrapper, he already abandoned the project but still made it available up there in case someone would be interested. There's no support for it now here, well maybe from a few users, but still you can't post wrapper bugs here because the maintainer already "left the building", his repo should have those activities but the driver is no longer there.<br><br>Github issues makes it easy to track duplicate issues so it can be referenced and link a pull request (in case of).<br><br>When a project is put up on Github, the facilities for managing it are all there, even bug reporting. It's not the author's fault that users don't know how to use git/github, at least for reporting issues, you just need to create an account and post it there.<br><br>And in case someone will bring it up, yes I don't have a github account myself, I used to have one (deleted it) maybe one of these days I'll sign up again! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you do not know what you changed - download bla-master.zip again, unzip to another folder and run "Meld" (or another diff-tool) over these two folders to get a small diff-file showing the adjustments you've done.<br><br>Easy hmm?<br><br>Problem stays that most people wont be able to do such things because step 1 (knowledge about blitz3d + used language) is not taken. People could - like RemiD said - fix things in the framework (eg. a bone is not rotated if you give a negative angle).<br><br><br>Ahh - and before I forget it: another step to climb is to be able to compile the whole thing without needing masses of install/compile instructions. People prefer a "buildAll.bat" (or "make") and then to wait a bit.
