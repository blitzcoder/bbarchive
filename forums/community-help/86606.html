It's the same in Aus - Harvey Norman (large retailer in SA) has HDMI cables ranging from $AU100 - $300+...  That's something like 30-100 pounds.  And the shop assistants will of course push the most expensive cables to ensure their customer has the 'best quality experience' and the assistant the largest commission.<br><br>Meanwhile, across Rundle Mall JB Hifi sell ace cables ranging between $15-$50.
