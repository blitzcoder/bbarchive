Totally unacceptable considering ATi have done this a lot better: 3870x2 is almost identical to 4870 (power consumption, size, performance). 4870x2, twice as fast. 5870x2 is rumored to be at least 4 times as fast as 4870x2.

The only case I remember it was worth it was way back with the Voodoo 2 12mb cards from Daimond.<br><br>With graphics cards it's not only the numbers you must compare, but also the type of that number as well. The difference between a 6000, 7000, 8000 and 9000 series are mostly the extra calculations added in the newer versions like for example shaders and so on for better quality and better support with newer games. A good example was when I couldn't play BF2 just because my Nvidia 4800Ti card didn't had Shaders 2.0 inside :-(<br><br>A 8600GT card would probably come near the speed of a 9600GT card for example. I own a 9600GTS from eVGA (Last S stands for Superclocked) and it's about the same speed as a 8800GT.<br><br>Nvidia normally has a line of slow budget cards of every type like the GS series, then come the faster GT series which are at least twice as fast and then for the ones who have the money the GTX cards which are the fastest in most cases. There is even difference in what type of memmory is added to the card.<br><br>So if you gonna buy a card it's best to check websites like Tom's HW page wich can give you an idea how fast a card is compared to others.<br>And after that check the prices. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

(it really depends on what's the purpose of your video card - gaming or just plain decency)<br><br>I have an 8800GS at work and its fairly weak at running new games. Even call of duty 4 has FPS issues playing at 1280x1024 with medium details and no AA. I'm pretty sure 9300 is even weaker.<br><br>When 9800GX2 came out it was priced like that for being new :) Now it's almost worth it. Its pretty much the last dual-GPU card that nVidia made the right way.<br><br>Also, 9800 series are modified versions of the 8800 series. nVidia and rebranding are BFF. That's why I personally consider its not worth getting a 9xxx card UNLESS its custom built by the vendor with 1GB or 2GB VRAM.<br><br>I used to be an nVidia fan, and only used nVidia from the day I got my GeForce 2 Ultra 'till the day I replaced my 8800GT. When I wanted an upgrade from 8800GT, I couldn't find any good option from nVidia so I switched to ATi and got 4870x2. Sometime later I noticed the whole 4xxx series from ATi are very good, especially in the "shader processing" area. A friend of mine tested his 8800GT SLI vs ATi 4670. Surprisingly 4670 was twice as fast as the SLI setup on heavy shader computation (SSAO mostly), even though it was eating dust when facing high poly count and high resolution+AA.<br><br>Actually, the first question should have been: what do you plan on using your video card for?<br><br>1. gaming - get ATi 48xx series.<br>2. high-end gamedev (including shaders) - get nVidia 8800 or if you really have to, 9xxx (nVidia has excellent Developer tools, particularly NVPerfHUD)<br>3. low-end gamedev and multimedia - get either ATi or nVidia, doesn't matter that much, but look for passive cooling and low power consumption <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
