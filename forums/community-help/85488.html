Hidden away in the smallprint was a £40 cancellation fee, which you have to pay if you cancel within TWO years, despite it being a one year contract.<br><br>I took the matter up with Ofcom, arguing that if its a one year contract then I should not have to pay any cancellation fee after that period.  Eventually, Supanet didn't force me to pay it.  Although they refused to give me a MAC code for several weeks.<br><br>The point is that there are some very crooked ISPs out there who try their luck to see what they can get out of you.  Always ALWAYS argue if certain fees have not been made clear from the outset.  In my case, Supanet were selling a two year contract, dressed up to look like a 12 month one.  Unless you can find very specific details to get out of it, then you might not be so lucky.<br><br>Oh, and while I'm on a rant about ISPs, the only reason they have 12 month contracts is so you have to keep on paying them long after you've found out that the service they provide is tantamount to a couple of empty baked bean cans and a length of string.<br><br>If most ISPs weren't sub-par, there'd be no need for this 12/18/24 month contract lark.  You'd be on a rolling monthly contract and you'd stay with them because they were GOOD, and not because you had no choice. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you buy those services seperately you will pay a lot more in total.<br><br>Pretty much all providers do bundles now, although really it's only Virgin and Sky that have really good offers and they are pretty much comparable (Sky has more HD content but less Video-on-Demand).<br><br>I switched my parents over from seperate services to a bundle from Sky and they saved £25 a month and they got "free" Sky TV (they used a freeview box before).<br><br>If you are switching multiple services you have more bargaining power with the reps too and push for stuff and you can get it.<br><br>Word of warning though, changing over can be a real pain in the butt, I had lots of problems the last tim I changed proviers!<br><br>Darkheart <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
