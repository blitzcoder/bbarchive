Sony Nudes I picked up in Japan were the best but years of ear goo have essentially killed them, so I have a selection of others. All are better than Apple's headphones (widely regarded as the worst thing you can possibly put in your ear for comfort or sound quality).<br><br>The OP might want to check out some sports headphones, they're usually designed to a) stay on your head (hence the sport) but more interestingly b) let you hear what's around you so you don't get hit by cars etc... Check reviews and find some that seem like they should have decent quality. They will never be as good as canal or ear muff headphones, but they are probably good enough if you're demanding noise bleed so you can hear the outside world. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
