There is absolutely no logical reason - no <i>excuse</i> - from the user's perspective, why plugging in an infected USB stick should be a problem, for instance, because the user never gave that collection of static files permission to infect anything in the first place. In such situations, the responsibility for the problem lies with the OS developer to fix their broken product so that the infection can't repeat itself. This goes double for the iOS case, where nothing that hasn't come through Apple should <i>ever</i> be in a position to execute in any way.<br><br>Imagine a baffled Umbrella Corp. executive talking to a counterpart from a real-world company and asking "so do you just give away free tactical nukes with your medicines?"<br><br><br>Viruses do infect Unix-based products periodically; the difference is that the developers don't just shrug and suggest you get a third party to fix it for you as though they give up on building a working product; or suggest that it's your fault that a static file can somehow turn into executable code simply from existing on your machine without being explicitly granted permission to act. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

No 3rd party toolchains, plugins, or file editors, etc.<br><br>Security is a trade-off between safety and usability. you can't really compromise a paperweight, but you won't be very productive if that's all you have on your desk.<br><br>(And aside from the above: despite the best design and intentions, there's ALWAYS a chance that there's a bug in the program or compiler or library or &lt;whatever&gt; that allows an unexpected permission escalation: buffer overruns writing data to the wrong part of memory where it may get executed by an unrelated functioncall elsewhere, etc.<br>Writing 100% bug free software is near impossible, especially if you don't want to spend millions of dollars to write a "hello world" program.<br>(It's very expensive to have well-trained, well-rested and disciplined programmers that ALWAYS follow best practises, never take shortcuts, have multiple unrelated people audit and review the code, etc. The larger/more complex a program gets, the smaller the chance that there are no bugs. An OS is pretty much the largest program you're going to find. <br><br>On top of that: don't forget that the big operating systems like Windows, OSX and Linux, all have dozens of years of backwards-compatibility cruft under the hood, dating back to the era of single-user, non-networked systems. When do you think they last audited that happens under the hood in half of the command line tools that haven't been changed for the past two decades? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
