It needs to work on mobile devices, it needs to be open-source, and I <i>want</i> it to run on as low-end devices as possible because volume is more important to me than detail at the moment.<br><br>Unfortunately, I just don't have the experience to make a satisfyingly informed decision for myself on this matter, and also have difficulty in part because the main competitors seem pretty evenly matched (which I guess is good since it limits the damage of a poor choice). The big names in the open-source engine scene seem to be Ogre and Irrlicht. Has anyone had any experience using these?<br><br><br>Things to consider (or at least, things <i>I</i> think are worth considering, in my idiot way):<br><br>-- Realistically, how low-end do devices get in 3D terms? Will Ogre continue to perform adequately for simple scenes on weaker cards, or does it have a minimum threshold it needs before it will work properly? I can't find a satisfactorily clear answer to this.<br><br>-- In contrast, Irrlicht supposedly performs beautifully on low-end devices. Does this have negative consequences on higher-end ones? Does this have negative consequences for long-term support? I have heard that the Irrlicht architecture is quite chaotic (I have no idea what that means, not being a pro 3D engine author myself) and difficult to update compared to Ogre.<br><br>-- As a long-time B3D user, the whole fixed-function vs. shaders thing is largely baffling to me. I still think in terms of surfaces, vertices, textures, and CPU manipulation. How deprecated is this? Is there anything still on the market where the FF pipeline needs to be used instead of the shader one? Would using it cut a program off from running properly on high-end devices like an iPad? If both schools of thought are still current, is it even possible to make one program perform well on both kinds of device?<br><br>-- By extension, is it better to pick more than one graphics backend and target different devices separately?<br><br>-- As a long-time B3D user, I also think (for higher-level scene design) very much in terms of B3D's Entity system. How well does this map onto other engines? How much do scene management metaphors vary? Is B3D's system outdated, or quite standard?<br><br>-- I want a high level of control. Now it's clear that at the moment I have no idea what I'm asking for control over (do we still use CPU vertex manipulation in the real world?), but I want to be able to have my own code get in there and tweak the system as and when it is ready to do so. Is this feasible? Do engines exist that are very hackable at the application-level (i.e. I'm happy to recompile the engine if I have to, but I'd rather have access to a large number of medium-low level commands as well as the simple ones).<br><br>-- Features I want (note: not features I <i>need</i>, because I don't know how obsolete the things I want are and they may be a bad way to do things) include the ability to edit textures, the ability to <i>quickly</i> edit meshes on a per-vertex basis (e.g. B3D's CPU vertex control is good enough for frame-by-frame animation if you want), and control over medium-level things like the stencil buffer (because I'm too stupid to realise shaders are how to achieve that). Given those, things like file format support are a bit of a nonissue since writing a loader for a custom format becomes comparatively easy.<br><br>-- I don't "do" C++ (as some of you may have gathered from my multi-page rants), and will be writing either in C or through a C FFI. While wrapping the commands is no problem, assuming it hasn't been done (it's no problem to convert "o.meth(x)" into "meth(o, x)"), and it probably has been done, the nature of the API may be tailored to different application design philosophies, and I would rather like to use one that's more friendly to being wrapped and abstracted in this way.<br><br>-- I say Irrlicht and Ogre because they're what I know exist. If anyone has any other recommendations, I am interested. The open-source requirement is non-negotiable - it <i>has</i> to be a permissive-free-software licence (think BSD, zlib - <i>not</i> GPL) to comply with my needs for this project. Obviously I don't mind considering proprietary engines for use in the future, but they aren't suitable answers to this question.<br><br>-- I do know the difference, blurry as it is, between a rendering engine and a game engine. I am after a renderer that can be used in games, but I don't mind supplying everything other than the 3D with other libraries, and in fact would probably rather do that. I like minimalism.<br><br><br>I know "Ogre vs. Irrlicht" is a very dead horse, as is "pick me a 3D engine", but I hope I've supplied enough context to make this question a little more answerable.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

How deprecated is this? <br></div><br>It's not deprecated, you still have surfaces, vertices, textures and all that.<br><br>The difference is that adding shaders gives brushes a 'local' configuration of rendering.<br>With Blitz3D, every single brush has 'shininess', 'fullbright', 'alpha transparency' and other visual parameters. This can be understood as "every single brush is being rendered by the same <b>shader code</b>" - the shader that's used by the fixed-function pipeline.<br><br>Now that you have programmable shaders, each brush can have custom parameters, for instance, 'normalMap', 'refractionStrength' - virtually anything the programmer wants. This is why shaders are essential for next-gen fancy visual effects.<br>You code the way you want the visual elements of the brush to be related. Maybe you need an additional parameter for the aliens in your game, a 'glowStrength' float value. <br>You can also have very small shader code for meshes that are very simple to render - say, an opaque mesh that never uses 'alpha transparency' or 'shininess'.<br><br>You don't need to worry about shaders, they do more good than harm. <br>You do need to get familiar with them: most devices run on OpenGL ES, which is a special version of GL that's purposed for embedded systems, and with this you'll not have access to a fixed-function pipeline but you <b>can</b> most certainly reproduce the same functionality. <br>There are various tools out there that produce "fixed-function like" shader code, which is a single shader program that contains several parameters such as 'shininess', 'alpha transparency', 'flat-shading', 'vertex-colouring' etc.<br><br>In your case, you would assign to all 'brushes' (or 'materials', or whatever container your engine uses to store visual parameters) the same shader. <br>This is the precisely the same as using a FF pipeline, same parameters\rendering scheme for all meshes.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

What am I then using it for?<br><br>The main thing about choosing an engine is that I was hoping someone had insight into what the APIs are like (so ...the main thing other than performance and whether it works at all, anyway). For instance, how stuck are you if you don't want to rely on the native mesh loading or want to do crazy custom animations? Blitz3D's vertex and pixel access was easy and fast enough that if you needed to, you could simply write a new mesh or texture loader at the API level, or even an animation system (I'm guessing for animation, vertex shading has taken over at lest some of the workload, but the point about accessibility of the manipulation is the same).<br><br>Wicker's GameKit suggestion is what actually inspired me to ask this question in the first place (after it was mentioned in General Discussion) - at the time, I hadn't realised it supports both Ogre and Irrlicht versions and therefore might actually showcase the differences and relative strengths fairly well. Will need to take a look.<br><br>If I can interpret Kryzon's answers as meaning that in terms of literal ability to run, there should be relatively little difference, than it might make anything I get from a simple test site more meaningful. So I will probably do that (I'm not eager to devise tests for systems that I don't know - there's too much I will miss, but maybe something will be learned).<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
