They're organised in folders as such:<br><br>Artist Name<br>...Album Name<br>......MP3s here<br>...Another Album Name<br>......MP3s here<br>Another Artist Name<br>...Album Name<br>......MP3s here<br><br>I figured if I imported the whole lot into my iTunes library, it would lump all the MP3s together in albums according to the folder layout and filename, like every other MP3 player I've used, but it doesn't seem to.  I have hundreds of "Unknown Artist" albums containing one or two songs.  Presumably it's getting its information from the MP3 tags in the file itself, which is bad because many of them don't have this information.<br><br>Are there settings somewhere that will let me change this behaviour?  Because I'm buggered if I'm going to get all my CDs out and rip them all again. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
