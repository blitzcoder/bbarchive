Maybe do half the agreed upon price in advance? I guess it really depends on how competent of a programming you are. Because several things I could code myself in 3 hours someone seasoned could do in 30 minutes or less. LOL!<br><br>Even after being away from this community for 3 years I still recognize many of the names here.<br><br>I will admit I'm a far better designer than a coder. Which is why I would prefer to focus more of my efforts into tweaking the assets for my game project instead of getting things to work. Within the next few weeks I will be comfortable labeling my game officially in the Alpha stage, so I was hoping to see who out here has a little free time and will work for a reasonable price. Personally I feel that weekly milestones would be the best approach.<br><br>An example of what I need help with:<br>1. Implementing the GUI from concept to full functionality in the game.<br>2. Rework the Flight mechanics to be more realistic.<br>3. Smoothing out the animations in blitz.<br><br>I will handle all the assets regarding models, animation, texture, music, etc... I will post some screenshots of my work in progress and general idea in another thread. I have always followed this quote by Chuck Yeager "It's the man not the Machine".<br><br>Ken Silverman said something similar about game development and technology. It's not the tech you use its what you do with the tech. Proof that an idea sells better than anything else is the fact Minecraft, a messy Java game by and Indie Dev was sold to Microsoft for 2.8 billion??? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Gui - 8 hours (1 full day with testing)<br>2. Flight mechanics 4 hours (half a day with testing)<br>3. Smoothing animations - not sure how this is a coding issue, more an animation issue, but could be complex or could be simple depending on what is meant by this...I'd estimate 8 hours (1 full day with testing).<br><br>Total cost would be 20 hours work at $150AUD/$100USD per hour = $3000 AUD/$2000USD. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

A bit higher than what I can currently afford but that is a very fair price.<br><br>Regarding the animations its more or less getting things to behave correctly and having the entities follow a waypoint system. I'll probably be able to handle this myself once I finish more of the animations, just after a 3 year break some of this feels brand new again. :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Art cost me approximately $3000.  I also had to purchase hardware for my testing, spend on marketing, licences and sound effects and a host of other expenses that came to a total of $7000 for the project (AUD).<br><br>With all that effort I managed to recover about $60AUD in total sales before google took their cut of 30%.  <br><br>(Coding for my project would have cost about 600 hours but I did it myself).<br><br>So.....be sure you are willing to spend $3k on a project as it is a lot of money to spend and it can be tricky to make it back (unless you don't care about that). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That way I could save some money and focus the budget on other areas.<br><br>I have 3 different GUI concepts in progress right now. Each do the job but do not fit in aesthetically as well as I'd like. I have a few  books on 1960's through 1980's jet fighters and various Britannica books I'm studying as reference. If anyone knows of a book that specifically addresses Military GUI and HUD systems let me know!<br><br>The first design shows everything which induces information overload... So what I'm trying to do is split the various systems into 4 parts, switching between them via the F1, F2, etc... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
