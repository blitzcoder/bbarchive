Most countries strongly restrict who is allowed to settle in their borders. (All countries that you'd <i>want</i> to move to, at least) Even if you can cross the border to visit a country, you can't just get a job somewhere: you need to get a work permit and tax ID from the government to be allowed to take a job, and it is illegal for employers to hire you without such a work permit.<br><br>In reality: Unless you are one of the following:<br>- highly educated professional<br>- Oppressed minority in danger in your own country (Political asylum seeker)<br>- Have historical / family ties to a specific country<br>- Foreigner marrying a local citizen<br>- Have a lot of money and are investing in / creating jobs in a country<br>- Sometime have religious ties (e.g. Jewish people can move to Israel)<br>- Go to an undeveloped country where the government doesn't really care<br><br>The unfortunate reality is that you have little chance to be allowed legal access to move, settle, and work in a different country. Most of the 'rich' countries don't just want to open their borders and end up helping out millions of poor foreigners moving in, using up resources. <br>In the end, the more 'desirable' a country is, the harder it is for others to get in and settle there.<br><br>If you are a doctor and there are no local people available, a hospital can petition for a work permit for you and be allowed to hire you and fly you over. but for 'uneducated work (farm worker, factory worker, janitorial worker, etc.) there are <i>countless</i> of unemployed local citizens that can do that kind of work too, and the government would tell a company to hire one of them instead and won't give out a work permit to get more foreigners.<br>(And even educated professions like computer programmers and such don't necessarily qualify for work permits - it depends on how much of a demand there is that can't already be filled by the local labor force)<br><br>After all, each and every country's government's primary responsibility is the best interests of its own citizens, not foreigners -- no matter how 'unfair' that may seem for those unfortunate enough to have born in poorer countries. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
