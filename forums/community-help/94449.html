I should also point out that every company puts out a lemon or two in their time; you can't go assuming the company's entire range is bad because of a bad product. I've spoken to people that won't TOUCH a Hewlett-Packard computer, yet all three of our family PCs through the years have been HP - Celeron 633MHz, P4 3GHz and Athlon FX5200 x2, respectively - and all three are still in perfect working order.<br><br>I also have a friend that has had a few weird and off-putting experiences with Amazon.com, and won't buy from them any more. We, on the other hand, have easily made over 150 purchases from Amazon to date, with not a SINGLE complaint.<br><br>Personally, I'd say that you probably had just such an experience: an individual product that no one knew should actually have been a factory reject. Or there are even other possibilities, like excessive dust, heat, etc... Do you have a case fan, or just a CPU cooler? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

(Do your lights ever flicker / dim slightly? If so, it would be an indication of unreliable power)<br><br>If it's one of those two, you really can't blame the psu at all if it gives out. Like others have pointed out, it's a bit silly to slam an entire company and all its products because your happened to die after two years.<br>(If it caught fire as soon as you plugged it in -- sure, that would have been sloppy workmenship. But failure after two years? That's near impossible for their quality control people to predict / prevent, isn't it? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
