 am a fan of Super Moron Idiot and I was just wondering if you were 
going to continue working on it. I really like the game and I hope to 
see it in full form.<br><br>thanks,<br>Dburnell01<br>------------------<br><br>See,
 one email.  Just one.  And I worked on the game and posted an update.  
If I met people who downloaded my game on the street, they would say 
something like, "How's the game coming along?" or, "I liked such and 
such" or "You are a waste of matter."  But because we are all connected 
with the one interweb, for some reason it drives us apart.  We are 
nothing more than blips on an IM client, "Idiot logged on"/"Idiot logged
 off."  It's just a virtual pulse that says I am probably not dead yet. 
 REQ/ACK.<br><br>On the flip side, with no Internet no one would have downloaded the game in the first place.  <br><br>The point is... I forget now. <br><br>Moving
 on, I don't know what was added since the last update, but I just put 
in a look-ahead camera so you aren't always centered on the screen.  It 
wasn't as tricky as it sounds, but it was trickier than it didn't sound.<br><br>I also updated moron's running animation and added a toilet swirl animation.  <br><br>I can only hope there will be more to come, or I guess could work on it instead.<br> <br><br> --==http://www.planetidiot.com/games==--<br>XP Home SP2 - P4 1.6GHz - 640MB Ram<br>NVIDIA GeForce 6800 GT </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Old updates from my old BlitzCoder worklog</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2005-10-23)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> 06/01/2003<br>... uh... something clever<br><br>Work
 continues on the graphics initialization crap. It seems pretty well 
wrapped up now, but I'm going to have it re-init each world as opposed 
to each level, since it was the over-map that was causing this issue 
anyway. This also opens the door/can of worms to where I could have all 
new backgrounds/enemies/etc. for each world, if I felt the urge.<br><br><br>	05/18/2003<br> appy birthday to me<br>H<br><br>Ok,
 so I've been a lazy little boy. I have my reasons though... I hit a 
memory issue where if you close &amp; load images a lot bad things 
happen. In fact, I'm in the middle of another weird issue in trying to 
solve the previous issue.<br><br>A lot of recoding needs to be done for 
the whole graphics initializations, and a lot of testing needs to be 
done on those fixes. It is not fun.<br><br>I have been retweaking the 
levels to be less frustrating though which is a lot easier than the 
other issues. If I can make it through this I can probably finish the 
game one day. I hope.<br><br><br>	12/03/2002<br>WHEW.<br><br>Boss finished, bugs fixed, levels tweaked, new release coming.<br><br><br>	12/01/2002<br>Blech<br><br>Ok,
 the boss is pretty much finished. I added sound effects and all that 
nonsense. I still need to add some sort of "activate the boss if you get
 to it" thing.<br><br>And somethings wacky with the old platforms now, must fix. Other stuff.<br><br>More and more I'm thinking I need a more functional title/options screen... I'll see how long I can put that off for.<br><br>	11/25/2002<br>Bossy!<br><br>He's almost done!

 it's grown on me. But if I have to do one more freaking jumping puzzle 
where the penalty for missing a jump is watching a 30 second cut scene 
and starting all over I swear I'm going to jump in front of a blimp.<br><br>Wait,
 this is a work log. Oops. I'm adding ... duhn duhn duhn DAAAAH: The 
first boss!!! It's not as easy as adding a new level, but it's coming 
along. Thanks to my friend Bart for the idea. Well ideas. Two seperate 
ideas I combined to form Mega-Idea. I never thought I could turn the 
song "Vestigial Sister" into anything other than a recurring nightmare. 
Leave it to the true Nispy fans to give the good ideas. I hope to have 
it working soon :)<br><br><br>	11/20/2002<br>Civ III Multiplayer owns my life<br><br>But
 I've managed to do *some* work. I more or less finished up level 1-4, 
except for the boss who I don't know who is yet. I made it so enemies 
die when they touch lava or whatever :)<br><br>Also, the collapsing platforms fall apart in the direction you run in. Did some other fixes. I forget what. :P<br><br><br>	11/19/2002<br>zzzzZZZSNORT!!! Wha? Football practice!<br><br>Oh...
 never mind. So I was squashing some bugs and adding death music thanks 
to Moron who finally sent me the midi file. But I think the death music 
needs to be a digital sound clip since Blitz insists on looping midi's 
maniacally. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad it loops them. It didn't used 
to, and now the ChannelPlaying command is all @#!;ed up with midi so 
there wouldn't be anyway to loop them otherwise. I just wish you could 
use all the normal PlaySound &amp; LoopSound commands with midi. And 
have it work. With no glitches.<br><br>That's it, nothing exciting. But 
one has to fix bugs and such. You have to break a few eggs if life hands
 you flies with lemonaide. Or something.<br><br><br>	11/18/2002<br>ZZzzzzz...<br><br>I stayed up late last night working on level 1-4.<br><br>I
 have 2 new types of cheese platforms, horizontally and vertically 
sliding platforms (they ping-pong back &amp; forth) and they work great.
 I found however that sometimes you would get to a part of the level and
 the platform would be off the screen, making it less-than-clear what 
you were supposed to do. So, I added count-down tiles that show you how 
many tiles away the platform is. It's a simple thing, but kinda cool 
anyway.<br><br>I think I have about a third of the level completed. Just think... I'll have to come up with a boss for the end of it 8)<br><br><br>	11/17/2002<br>los trabajos de la llave.<br><br>I'm not sure that makes sense. But I now have keys and locks working. There are 6 key colors that match 6 lock colors. Yay.<br><br>One
 major question as a result of this is, do keys carry from one round to 
the next? If so, I'll have to keep a record of all the locks you 
unlocked and all the keys you picked up, so it stays consistant when 
levels get reloaded. I think it would be more interesting to carry keys 
from round to round and level to level, but it will certainly be more 
work and more bug checking. It's one to sit on for a while.<br><br>Alternatively,
 maybe you can carry keys over, but locks (and keys) regenerate each 
time you enter the level. So, if you got a blue key on 1-1, and carried 
it to 1-3 to use it, the next time you went to 1-3 the lock would 
return, and so you would have to return to 1-1 to get another key. Not 
an ideal solution, but it wouldn't be too bad.<br><br>In other 
development news, collapsing platforms pretty much work how I want 'em 
too. You have to run across 'em quickly or they fall down -- taking you 
with them! Wow! A break through in 2D gaming excitement! 'Cep'n' for 
it's not!<br><br>Sigh... the end of another weeked.<br><br>	11/14/2002<br>No big whoop<br><br>I'm
 adding collapsing floors. It will take some work, but it will be cool. 
As I'm making this 4th level I'm getting all sorts of ideas. Also I want
 to add different types of moving platforms, like side to side ones. 
Mainly I've been working on graphics and stuff for more content.<br><br><br>	11/13/2002<br>More more more<br><br>I
 fixed the special items, they were goofing. Also I made the levels 
bigger up &amp; down... you probably won't see any change in the current
 level set, but the new vertical space will be taken advantage of in 
other levels. Speaking of other levels, I got started on level 1-4, 
which is going to be some sort of castle or other. There is also a world
 1-9 which is kind of a warp-to area where you can collect bonuses &amp;
 stuff.<br><br>I'm thinking I need to make the paths between levels only
 traversable if there is an exit to the other level, as opposed to a 
warp. The difference here is if you warp from 1-1 to 1-9 via a warp 
toilet, you should not be able to "walk" from one to the other on the 
over map. However, if you finish stage 1-1 and get to 1-2, you should be
 able to walk from one to the other. This shouldn't be too hard to add 
in.<br><br><br>	11/12/2002<br>Slow but steady wins the race!<br>(VROOOM! VROOOM-VROOOM! VROOOOOM!)<br><br>Ok,
 I got connectors between the round locations on the map, and also made 
toilets able to put you anywhere if they warp you to another round. This
 way there can be multiple entrances to different rounds, and they can 
start you in different locations.<br><br>Also tweaked a few levels out and fixed some bugs introduced by all this madness. Whew! Now, possibly on to more game content...<br><br><br>	11/11/2002<br>I'm stuck on toilets!<br><br>Yeah,
 I guess I'm weird like that. So I added some random junk that can come 
out of toilets (no, not Mr. Hanky) -- some with sound effects, and also 
added the ability for toilets to hide "special items" ... well, keys any
 way. Keys will unlock something. Maybe a toilet, maybe a door, I don't 
know yet. But it will unlock some kind of a dealy-ma-bob.<br><br>This 
done, I think the next logical step is to get the overmap more 
functional and step up content creation. So, hopefully that translates 
into a whole first world! Of course, that will take a while. I probably 
won't release an update until a good chunk of work is done.<br><br><br>	11/06/2002<br>WhawhaWHAAAT?<br><br>Regular updates? Ok, maybe two in a row isn't regular. I need more BlitzBran or something. Anyway.<br><br>Uhhhh,
 right, so now you can go down toilets and skip to different stages. 
This is no big thingy, but it's one more function the toilets serve. 
Hey, at least it's progress, right?<br><br><br>	11/05/2002<br>I'm a lazy boy<br><br>I
 didn't know it had been a freaking month... geez. Well, I was working 
on WordYo, but until George can catch up on his email and tell me that 
I'm goin to make a bajillion dollars, I don't think I can motivate 
myself to work on that game.<br><br>So I started in on SMI again. I 
rewrote the toilet code, so now I can define toilets to do different 
things in the editor. Also, I made it take a bit longer to get your 
speed up, it could be good or bad. I haven't decided yet.<br><br>I fixed some bug where the llamas would come up if you were next to them. Naughty llamas.<br><br><br>	10/07/2002<br>Stuff<br><br>Began
 toilet rewrite to support future sneaky super secret stuff that rules 
the head of yon hither freaks and spankers. I should really go to bed 
now.<br><br><br>	10/02/2002<br>@#!;ing Dell<br><br>I hate Dell. Well, my computer is alive again no thanks to them, and I managed to squeeze in a bit of coding last night.<br><br>I've
 changed the way exits are handled, which was probably needed, but I'm 
going to do toilets differently too to handle exiting, or containing 
specific powerups. Plus I'll be making it so I can paste a whole toilet 
down in the editor instead of drawing them one freaking tile at a time.<br><br>But,
 uhhh, exits. Yeah. So now there's going to be finish lines and those 
doors are just decoration. I'm debating if I should have some sort of 
bonus thing some how when you finish (like how in Mario you would jump 
for the flag pole/bar/prize box). I'll probably leave it and do any 
bonus stuff on a seperate screen (like a slot machine or something).<br><br><br>	09/24/2002<br>Yippy-yoo<br><br>A
 rough over-map is in place. It will show the current position in the 
world. I need to rework how exits are incorporated into the game, I 
think I'll add it into the editor so it'll be easier to manage all the 
level exits. Then I can draw connecting lines between all the different 
areas you've visited. But it's late. Homer sleep now.<br><br><br>	9/23/2002<br>Where does the time go?<br><br>Weird.
 Well, I just finished the new powerup and it was a good chunk of work. 
For the heck of it I threw in an extra life power up too. Did some work 
on the maps and whatnot.<br><br>Next I'll try to tackle the over maps, 
(the code at least) and a bug with the sandwich/1-up where they don't 
collision detect with floors/walls nicely.<br><br><br>	09/10/2002<br>Continuence<br><br>Is
 that a word? Anyway, working on putting in a new power-up. I also 
narrowed the toilet-go-down zone so you can't sneak around llamas as 
easy.<br><br>The new powerup is going to take some doing. I reeeally 
want to do an over-map, but it would take some work and not be very 
accurate for long... maybe I should just put the code in and a crappy 
map for now. Each level could have a x,y marker on the map once you get 
to that level. This way I can have multiple exits on different levels. I
 could also have multiple entrances as well... so if you left a level 
through a toilet and came back, it would start you at that toilet. 
Anyway, it's all speculation at this point. What's a design doc again?<br><br><br>	09/06/2002<br>Can't wait!<br><br>Sorry, I know it's a minor update, but.. HERE'S AN UPDATE ANYWAY!!!<br><br>I got the toilets working w/ sfx, axed a few bugs and got all excited-like. I think I wet 'em.<br><br>Anyway, new update for your downloading play-czar.<br><br><br>	09/04/2002<br>Onward...<br><br>Well,
 you can now go down toilets. Sorta. The code was acting up so I'm still
 looking into it. Basically, toilets will act as "warps" to eachother. I
 can create subzones within the level that you can warp to, and in the 
future I can add warping to other places too I guess.<br><br>I also drew a new powerup... the fishing pole. It doesn't do anything yet. I'm gonna get the toilets working first.<br><br>In other random news, a game artist friend of mine swears he will do some art for the game. We shall see... we shall see...<br><br><br>	08/30/2002<br>Excuses, excuses<br><br>So I was working on my "Stupidest Game" contest entry. Sue me. I haven't forgotten about SMI! Work shall continue.<br><br><br>	07/31/2002<br>Eh-ehm<br><br>I
 suppose I should explain the halting of updates, I'm in the process of 
moving, and you know how that is. Should be all wrapped up in a week 
though.<br><br><br>	07/09/2002<br>Still at it<br><br>I redrew the trout 
enemy to look more like a dead trout and less like a dead dolphin last 
night. I also tweaked its animation speed to flap its wings faster as it
 goes up and slow as it falls. I still need to make it turn and face 
you.<br><br>I think next I'll work on a less vestigial score board; at 
least put some icons up for health, etc. I also really want to get the 
toilet sub-zones in the game, which should be an adventure and a half. 
I'm about to take another leap into making the way the game plays out 
more final. Planning is in order... :S<br><br><br>	07/09/2002<br>After a much needed break...<br><br>I have returned from NY and did a few significant additions to the game while I was there, so I'll just list 'em:<br><br>One-way
 floors - I don't really know what to call these, but they're in every 
platform game known to man. You can jump up through them, but you walk 
on them. Needs a bit of tweaking, but it works for the most part.<br><br>Enemies turn around if they bump into each other<br><br>Tweaked
 stomping routing - harder to stomp enemies when not actually stomping 
down. Before you could jump and stomp enemies even if you were 
underneath them :S<br><br>Added flying dead trout enemy - he's a dead trout with wings that flies up and down<br><br>Added
 moving platforms! - Yaaay. Right now there are just up/down wrapping 
platforms of cheese, but the code is ready for adding side-to-side 
platforms and others.<br><br>Fixed enemy-hit-you-through-wall glitch - 
nobody found this bug: if you are backed against a wall and an enemy 
hits you, he can knock you *through* the wall resulting in naughty 
problems. This is fixed.<br><br>New demo should be forthcoming soon or something.<br><br><br>	06/24/2002<br>Gaaahh!<br><br>Something
 went weird and I lost the new level checkpoint graphics... and the game
 is crashing and doing weird things. I think I some how overwrote all 
the levels &amp; level graphics with the previous version. I have no 
idea how it happened, or the extent of the damage. I don't think it's 
too bad though...<br><br>UPDATE:<br>Got it all back up to date... that was weird.<br><br><br>	06/16/2002<br>Duh duh duuuuh<br><br>The
 demo is released, well, it was a few days ago but you wouldn't know it.
 I'm gonna hold off probably longer for the next demo.<br><br>Today I 
completed mid-level check points, which can actually be anywhere, and 
there can be any number of them. I added a personal llama death noise 
also. I'm not sure what a dying llama sounds like, but that's probably 
not that important. I centralized the tile type detection code, so next 
time I add something like checkpoint blocks it will be easier to put in.
 That's about it.<br><br>On an unrelated note, I got my Afterburner 
installed on my GBA and now I can see the screen! But I can't see the 
bottom of the screen because the light thingy is too high. I'll try to 
fix it, and probably break it in the process.<br><br><br>	06/12/2002<br>Almost there..!<br><br>I
 worked a few more bugs out last night. The Belly Monster behaves 
properly now, I fixed a bug where you could end up halfway inside of a 
brick, and touched up the enemy display code. I also put some more 
touches on the levels and lowered your terminal velocity so you can 
navigate pits with spikeys.<br><br>Whew! After some more testing, it may be ready for a 3 level demo release.<br><br><br>	06/11/2002<br>Hi again<br><br>I've
 got a rough draft set of 3 levels working, all with custom "middle 
layer" parallax tiles. Creating them has given me more ideas as I had 
suspected. This thing has a way of snow balling...<br><br>Anyway, I'm 
trying to resolve some issues such as: Jumping Jimmy Jackass not facing 
you when you are to the right of him (same for Belly Monster), Belly 
Monster not taking vertical distance into effect before charging at you,
 and uh... other stuff. I forgot now. This worklog thingy is 
distracting.<br><br><br>	06/07/2002<br>Allo Dair Pholx<br><br>Much work 
was done last night (and the night before). There are now up to 3 layers
 of parallax. This will be controllable as I noticed the large 256x256 
tiled middle layer slowed the game down on my laptop. But it runs 
beautifully on my 1.6 GHz P4 (and it damn well better!).<br><br>I've 
been focusing on content, so most of the work has been graphical. I have
 middle layer tile sets for level 1-1 and 1-2, which I can reuse on 
future levels. I've added spikes that are bad to hit and other forground
 tiles that aren't that interesting to talk about.<br><br>I've decided 
NOT to put the middle layer into the level editor for now. I may not put
 it in at all honestly. The maps are only like 25x6 or something, so it 
really doesn't seem worth the effort to code it in. It's easier just to 
hard-code them.<br><br>Now that the levels are huge, it takes a few 
sessions just to get them to a point where I'm happy with them. The good
 part is, I'm really getting a feel for the types of things the game is 
lacking. This thing could really pan out into something bigger than what
 I originally thought, without too much more effort.<br><br>Once I have 
about four rounds complete, I think I'll upload a new WIP demo. It has 
come so far that I think it would be practically a new experience for 
most people.<br><br><br>	06/05/2002<br>Off we go...<br><br>Well I 
started the first draft for world 1-1. It is outdoors and is probably 
the most similar a level will get to old skool mario. It departs from 
that quickly though, and I'm really liking the added height the levels 
have.<br><br>I'm also getting some ideas as to what might make the game 
better now that I'm dealing with real levels. I definately need more 
interesting enemies, the current ones aren't going to hold anyone's 
attention for an entire game. I've really been toying with the idea of 
more complicated paralax, that is, making a background editor instead of
 just tiling an image. This would mean more editor work, but I'm not 
convinced it wouldn't be worth doing. I also need more powerups, and I 
think I'm going to have to implement moving platforms of some type. All 
in all, it will mean more changes to the editor and game engine in the 
long run, but I suppose I'll burn that bridge when I come to it. Or 
something.<br><br><br>	06/04/2002<br>YEEEEEEEHAAAAAAAAH!<br><br>I 
thought this would take forever and a day, but it was a lot less painful
 than I imagined... SMI now scrolls VERTICALLY as well as horizonally. 
I'm not talking that fake vertical thing I was doing, it's a big honkin'
 map now. Well, as big and as honkin' as I end up making it. I had to 
completely gut every line of code that involved drawing, collision 
detecting, or anything else involving x,y coords, but it works! Gotta 
love working on 2 year old code. Anyway, I think game content can 
officially start.<br><br>Not that I'm done with the rest of the stuff by
 any means, but that smaller-than-mario map was really limiting me. I 
have some new ideas, and I think draft one of the levels can begin. Hap!<br><br><br>	06/03/2002<br>I'm all sun-burny<br><br>But
 the good news is I put in more work this weekend. There are a few more 
sound effects, stomp-multiplier-bonus-points (and 1-up after 5 stomps), 
control tweaks, little score message thingies, and stuff.<br><br>Your 
jump height is now determined by your actual speed, not by whether you 
are holding down the run button. Also, you must slow down before turning
 around! Mario did this, and while it makes control a little less 
precise, it makes over-compensation more difficult (this was a problem 
for a quite a few people). That means, you'd try to jump on a little 
platform, miss it, hit the opposite direction to try and land on it 
again, miss it again, turn back, land on it, freak out that you were 
going to run off the side and spaz back and forth until you ran off the 
edge. I guess there is a such thing as too much control.<br><br>I made 
the apples spin correctly depending on direction and sped them up a bit 
too. Hopefully I'll get more work done tonight, I'm getting really 
impatient and want to start actual game content soon!<br><br><br>	05/29/2002<br>WHEW!<br><br>Almost
 threw a fit last night tracking down another bug. It blows my mind how 
these things slip past me sometimes. Well, at least I'm working on it 
pretty regularly these days.<br><br>UPDATE:<br>Finally, perfect 
collision on "bumping" enemies when you hit the brick under them. No 
huge deal, but it was something that was irritating me for a while now.<br><br><br>	05/28/2002<br>Erg<br><br>Fixed
 two more bugs... these things are bound to happen when you are editing 2
 year old code. "But the earliest update you have on here is from 
08/09/2001!" you say? Well, BlitzCoder wasn't always around, mind you. 
I'm looking at SuperMoronIdiotv19a.bb here with a modified date of 
10/19/2000. It won't even run because the music and sound commands 
changed. Also, there used to be a command called "FindGfxMode(x,y,c)" 
which isn't around any more.<br><br>It's really saddening to me how 
little has actually changed since then. I've added a few more enemies 
&amp; items, cleaned up the code a few times, but that's about it. Sigh.
 I wish I could take 10 years off of work. Maybe I'll go play the 
lottery with 1-2-3-4-5-6 and see what happens.<br><br>UPDATE:<br>Fixed a couple more things. The Sandwich collides with walls better now too.<br><br><br>	05/27/2002<br>Yeehoo!<br><br>Spent
 a few days getting those nutty bugs out and in doing so I completely 
rewrote the way items are handled in the save file &amp; editor. So if 
anyone made any maps with the editor (probably not?) they won't work 
with future versions.<br><br>BUT brick "bumping" is now working properly
 with no more item glitches. Next I'll probably look into why the 
sandwich powerup is fruity, and keep you from getting the apple the 
instant you hit the brick (sometimes happens).<br><br><br>	05/25/2002<br>I'm as happy as a clam<br><br>A
 happy clam, that is. I gots more work done today. I've been convinced 
through the forum to keep new uploads few and far between so people 
actually have something new to play.<br><br>Anyway, I've got the old 
skool Mario brick "bumping" working, so you actually get visual feedback
 when you hit a brick. Pretty neato. This will make it much more 
accurate when I check if you are bumping underneath an enemy (or item?).
 Anyway, in the process of doing that the whole item/brick code is a lot
 cleaner.<br><br>I'm not sure why I went off on a tangent to work on a 
part of the game I never planned on putting in, but whatever. It looks 
cool and makes the game a little friendlier now that you can see if you 
actually hit the brick you think you did.<br><br>I keep getting the urge to put in a real title screen, but I'm fighting it to make the game better first.<br><br>UPDATE:<br>Just
 found that something has introduced a strange new bug. Blocks appearing
 like you got powerups in strange places :S Well, I'll look into it next
 time.<br><br><br>	05/22/2002<br>Ouch<br><br>My boss turned 40 
yesterday. So I went out drinking with him and some folx from work. I 
think I had one too many margaritas. Ugh. Short story shorter: No 
progress. For this, I am truly sorry.<br><br><br>	05/21/2002<br>Ugh.<br><br>Finally
 got on my computer again and managed to squeeze out another hour of 
coding. So, version .039a or something is available. I can't wait for my
 vacation in July... I'm just gonna take my laptop up to my parent's 
lake house in NY and code on the patio overlooking the bay. A beer in my
 hand and my minidisc player with headphones on to block out everyone 
nagging me to go somewhere and do some boring crap. Ahhhh.<br><br>Anyway,
 this update adds apples and makes the thing playable again without that
 stutter bug. That sounds funny. "Stutterbug." Anyway, you spit apples 
like how you thew the fireballs that somehow came out of a flower on 
Super Mario Bros. I never worry about things not making sense in this 
game, because they made no sense in Mario. I remember reading the NES 
instruction manual when I was in 5th grade and laughing my booty off. 
Something about Mario the plumber having to save the princess of the 
mushroom kingdom from the evil turtle king. And all the mushroom people 
were turned into bricks. Yes, bricks. So everytime you smash a brick in 
mario, you're killing some innocent mushroom-person. And then there's 
the mushroom that makes you big for some reason. And the flower that 
makes you shoot fire. The happy clouds, the 8 bowser clones, and the 
flagpole. I never understood that. But it didn't matter. It was fun, and
 that's all I'm aiming for with SMI.<br><br><br>	05-17-2002<br>Lordy.<br><br>So
 I busted my butt to get all my work done yesterday so I could go home 
early (that is, an hour late) and work on the game only to find that 
there's plastic covering everything in the computer room because the 
owner of the house (my roommate's dad) decided to paint a bunch of 
rooms. I'm pretty sure that's not legal, but whatever. Point being I was
 gonna work on the game but I couldn't for reasons beyond my (and her) 
control.<br><br><br>	05-16-2002<br>Oops.<br><br>I did no work last 
night. This entry is just to make me feel like a horrible, horrible 
person who cares more about his own selfish Resident Evil game on the 
Gamecube than he does the trillions of Super Moron Idiot fans who stay 
up in a cold sweat all night waiting for an update. I would lash myself 
with a belt tonight when I get home as punishment, but then I wouldn't 
be working on the game again, and then I'd be in double dog trouble.<br><br><br>	05/15/2002<br>Hi-diddly-ho neighbor-ino's!<br><br>Well,
 no feedback on the apples so I'm going to trust my in-stinks and like, 
uh, do stuff. I've got the apples shooting and killing and maiming. They
 kind of blast through the enemies right now, like some sort of 
high-powered beam apple, but that'll change. I'd like to see them 
explode with bits of apple littering the levels, which could slow things
 down. Maybe I'll add a "level-of-apple" control to the options menu. I 
should probably add an options menu first though.<br><br>On the music 
front, the music man Pierre Dupree (french for "Peter Of Pree") is 
finishing his bastards degree or something this week, so he'll 
supposedly be available for giving me more music.<br><br>I'd like to 
throw a percentage completage at you, but I'd be pulling it out of my 
bo-hiney. Let's just say I need a few more power ups, a bunch more 
enemies, some more fixes here and there, more sound effects, a title 
&amp; options screen, game over screen, high score list and *then* I can
 start doing level design and what not. Not to mention bosses. Ugh. 
It'll probably be another year :(<br><br><br>	05/13/2002<br>Wattup foolz?<br><br>Did
 some more work this weekend, hoping to have a new build this week. Due 
to the new midi glitch, the songs won't loop until: A) There's a new 
Blitz fix or B) I'm finished with the game and sit down to compute the 
length of each finalized song in milliseconds so I can hard-code a music
 looping routine.<br><br>In the next update look for:<br>Apples!<br>No stuttering (seen in last update)<br><br>I am taking suggestions for the way the apple powerup is handled:<br><br>-Should you require underwear before you can get the apple?<br><br>-If
 so, what if you have underwear, then make the apple powerup appear, 
then lose underwear, then get the apple? Should you still get the apple 
powerup, or just treat it like underwear?<br><br>-If you get hit should you lose both? If not, which should you lose first?<br><br>-Should the apple be fired with the run button? Or with a separate button?<br><br>You know how to reach me to lemme know :)<br><br><br>	05/09/2002<br>Oooh, a worklog thing! Huh huh... I said log.<br><br>Well
 here's the scoop: There's an issue with SMI now, going back to my 
insistence on using midi files. The new Blitz update that fixed the 
previous midi issues has introduced a new one. You can't loop midi in 
Blitz so I have to check repeatedly to see if the music has stopped 
playing. Every time I do this in the new Blitz version, it causes a 
slight pause on "slower" systems (I hate calling a 700MHz system slow).<br><br>As
 far as work goes, I was in the middle of adding the Apple power-up when
 I thought I'd release a new version to address the previous music 
issue. The apple power-up will act like the fire flower from Mario. The 
game was lacking a projectile attack, and Apples were the logical 
choice. "Apples" was one of the original Nispy songs, and my favorite 
Nispy song. Idiot will get red apples, and moron will get green apples. I
 haven't decided if you will need the underwear on your head to get the 
apples (like how Mario needed the mushroom before getting the flower). 
On the one hand, it adds some more value to not getting hurt, but on the
 other hand, it doesn't make any sense. Not like "Super Moron Idiot" 
makes any sense...<br><br>There will probably be another update when the
 Blitz issue gets resolved. Mark is always so good about those things. 
In the mean time, check out some free Nispy mp3's from our mp3.com page 
and fill in the form with fake info if they ask for your name and stuff.
 They make enough money gouging CD sales by 50%, they don't need your 
personal info for spam marketing. I recommend downloading "Llama," it's a
 classic, and also my favorite Nispy song.<br><br>Updates:<br>05/07/2002
 - Space llama no longer pops up if you are on/near a toilet. Apple item
 graphic is in (can't get it yet). Compiled with new Blitz version -- 
this fixed the music glitch (Thanks Mark!).<br><br>03/14/2002 - New 
enemy: The space llama! For some reason he lives in the toilets and you 
can't stomp him because he's a SPACE llama. Or something. Also I added 
some secret cheat codes... heh heh heh.<br>03/12/2002 - New powerups, 
sound effects and more! It plays more like a game now... you can die and
 progress through the levels. Lots of updates!<br>03/03/2002 - Coins are
 grabbable, new purple land squid enemy, control pad support, minor 
vertical scroll, invincible for a sec after enemy hits, other stuff.<br>02/16/2002 - Refined the enemy routines (Belly Monster is now killable)<br>02/11/2002 - Smashing bricks gives items, invisible item bricks added<br>08/09/2001 - Enor-moose speed improvement<br> <br><br> --==http://www.planetidiot.com/games==--<br>XP Home SP2 - P4 1.6GHz - 640MB Ram<br>NVIDIA GeForce 6800 GT </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
