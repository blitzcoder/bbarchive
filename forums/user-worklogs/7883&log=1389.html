 This is a modifier Grid that allows you to alter stats and add skills 
to your character.Ie your character is a God in Strength but a peon in 
Int easy fix is to open modifier slots and add -Str*n and +Int*n Soul 
Gems (You have to quest for these Base Types also thinkindg of adding 
recipies after Quest completion)<br><br>......Race: This is the core +/-
 of the character. The Race has restrictions that need to be followed 
they effect available Jobs/Weapons/Armour/Accessories/Skills..Might seen
 a bit of a negative but with the ability to ShapeChange this is a key 
factor in the game (currently you can only change into Humaniod Forms 
but might add a variation if it doesnt conflict the Summon/Merge 
abilities.<br><br>......Job: This is a special entity that attaches to 
the player and grants skills.The Job has restrictions that need to be 
followed they effect available Weapons/Armour/Accessories/Skills and 
also grant bonuses in areas <br><br>......SKILL TREE: This is very much like the FFX Sphere Grid Except Each Factor Has one ie<br>A Single Character Has<br>Base:SKILL TREE (This is identical for all characters)<br>Race:SKILL TREE (One for each Race)<br>Job:SKILL TREE (up to three at any one time)one for each job<br><br>All SkillTrees have node to unlock and activate as is relative to the player<br>Things to Note about unlocking <br><br>1.

 During your Quest you can unlock greater bonds with the Ether and 
improve Node ie You can get +lvl or N_level Linkers These are used to 
Upgrade Nodes <br>5a. (Wpn+3) + (Link+2) = (Wpn+5)<br>5b. (Wpn+3) + (Link=5) = (Wpn+5)<br>5c.

 inhabitants of Areon-X have reached a supreme state of Technological 
advancement they have become masters of all except Energy.<br><br>Well that was until Malic Kain created the Genisis Programme<br><br>Genisis was a 30 year work in progress. A combination of the most advanced AI and Nano Technology<br><br>In the year 7043 Genisis became Self aware and its development speed increased tenfold<br><br>Around
 the year 7059 Genisis discovered a way to create the utilmate energy 
source G Zen, one that would free the world from its current dilema<br><br>Energy
 had been a major problem right from the start of civilisation. 
Currently people had to go to wear biocharms a belt that collects waste 
energy from the wearer and converts this into energy this was the basic 
form of currency for the lower classes of the world<br><br>An individual Would earn a ratio compared to how hard they work<br><br>ie an average worker would generate 1k units of energy<br>a
 week and earn 100 Han he then would have to buy an average of 3k energy
 from the corperation at a rate of 600 Han so the corperation was 
growing very fat selling the 1k of worker energy back to the worker for a
 nice 100% profit<br><br>G Zen was a concept beyond Human comprehention 
it was a living bio organism contained within a Sphere of folded space 
the object travels in a coil pattern beyond the speed of light passing 
up to 100 suns in the journey absorbing solar energy.<br><br>taking 100k
 units of energy to start the journey and collecting 1mil units of 
energy in its lifetime releasing 10k inits of energy per week until its 
lifecycle is ended<br><br>The creation of G zen threatend the 
Corperations Hold over the world so they set about the destruction of 
Malik and the G zen project.<br><br>Genisis retaliated by putting Malik in cryo and sending a nano army to take on the Corperation<br><br>A huge battle began and Genisis was on the winning side until the Corperation Cut all Power to the sector of Maliks base<br><br>With G zen not stabilised it began to collect huge amounts of energy and its sphere began to warp<br><br>Genisis
 could see its destruction was immenent as began sending parts of its 
data banks to locations around the world and transported Maliks body to a
 unknown location<br><br>Zero Hour..<br>G Zens Sphere Fractured Releasing energy in amounts never before seen in the world.<br><br>Corperations Downfall creation of the Deadlands<br>True
 the Corperation had cut the power to Maliks sector but the energy 
rushed down the powerlines and caused a System failure in every one of 
there Sectors<br><br>Explotions continued well into the night until finally the silence came but a deadly silence to say the least<br><br>Deadlands Day Two<br>What remained of the corperation began to regroup and started up there defence programme NewOrder a Nano Repair Programme..<br><br>Somethings Wrong<br>The
 huge influx of energy had caused a glitch in the mainframe Data had 
become fused and the NanoMites could not Distinguish machines and 
Organics and the results where madness<br><br>Deadlands Days Three<br>The Corperation Retaliates and the Nanomites begin self preservation Machines Vs Organics<br><br>Deadlands Days Four<br>Mankinds Retreats From its Citys<br><br>A new Dawn for Areon-x<br><br>Mankind has been knocked back a few millenia and once again is having to fend for its self<br><br>Current Time..<br>
