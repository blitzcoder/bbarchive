 Sorry to report that i was a very long time away. Afther i finaly can 
work an the computer again. I found out that during the long time stand 
stil of the computer. The harddrive had some problems. Because of that i
 was not able to start windows again. And i did had not a backup of the 
program files i was making. Because of that. I have to start al over 
again. This means also that a lot of pre made function that i hade is 
lost. On this ground it wil take a long time for me to restart the 
project again. As soon as i am ready to do so i start the project again.

 This work log is meerly to say that i stil working on the program but 
iam stuck on some parts of the program. The program is working fine. 
Version 0.99 is ready. But not ready for relaesing it. There are some 
time problems. Some of the parts of the programs is not running fine. To
 slow. And if i transfer the program to a slower computer the game is to
 slow. So i am looking for solutions to make the game faster (At last so
 there is a timer to correct game speed om faster computer). Thats it 
for the moment. <br><br> Basic is Blitz<br>So games is Blitz </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Week2</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2007-05-21)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 A long time for me to pas to enter this log again. The game is 80% 
done. Game play is in. All the buttons ar working. The play is fully 
working. Only missing is now the highscore and entering the name af the 
player if the player is coming in the highscore list. <br><br>Added 
extra sound effect for colliding against the wall is the player try to 
over do it by going right or left. Sound effect added for dropping the 
jewels. And i did make good music for the intro and gameplay.  <br><br>When the whole game play is done i will get rid of the little things is saw in the game thats feel like a bug. <br><br> Basic is Blitz<br>So games is Blitz </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Week1 day 2</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2007-05-10)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Ok i have the buttons on screen and detection of it. Only the option 
button is working now. This button does controling the sound level and 
the music level. Adjusting the level is done by a slider bar that is 
filling up at 100% and is empty by 0%. Its follow the mouse goed. <br>When
 its done the settings is saved to a file so if the program is loading 
again its load the last settings. Works ok. Now i have to find out how 
the changes can have a direct effect. If the music already is playing 
then the level of music is not changing. thats the next step for 
tomorrow. <br><br> Basic is Blitz<br>So games is Blitz </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Log number 1</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2007-05-09)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 I hope that the final view is what i like. Started to greating the 
graphics. I saw i needed more than i was thinking. Crawiling on the 
internet for the wright sound effects and music. Found them. And rename 
the files for easy use. Its look ok. Now started to make te deviding of 
the functrions and files to handle everything better. At the moment i 
write this worklog 30% of the program is tested and done. The intro 
screen is ready. Topscore list is ready. Initializing sound and all the 
graphics is done. Main game loop is placed and i know where everyting 
has to be in place. Today starting the function for the buttons and the 
deviding of that. Be in touch. <br><br> Basic is Blitz<br>So games is Blitz </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
