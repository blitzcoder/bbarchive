 To adjust the "time out" feature of the quiz which "forces" a 
"PROGRESS" screen if no mouse/keyboard activity detected within 'X time'<br><br>my
 original idea here, was to print a "PROGRESS" screen to the monitor if 
the user left the quiz unattended for 5 minutes e.g you went to the 
toilet/ lunch<br><br>upon return to your computer - you would find on your screen a summary of your progress<br><br>there were 2 problems with this<br>a) X time was derived from loop cycles not milliseconds and equated to 1 minute not 5<br>b) the progress screen was forced BUT not displayed until the user MOVED the mouse<br><br>in the event, I thought "to hell with it" and removed the feature of "time out" completely<br>I
 never could fathom why the "progress" screen DIDN'T immediately 
display, something to do with setbuffer backbuffer() - flip, couldn't 
get to the bottom of it, it's all time and that just defeated me, must 
admit<br><br>2) To provide a loading screen<br><br>Upon loading, there was just a blank black screen...<br>loading from floppy - the game loaded for almost a minute through a black screen<br><br>ppl thought the game had crashed with no loading screen<br><br>W O R K ....to achieve targets<br><br>I
 had no flippin' loading screen, the one .bmp already called in the quiz
 took up enormous memory that Genexi2 had already criticised<br><br>I decided to go for a more "economic" approach<br><br>For one thing, Gomez had hosted the quiz on his site for me and there wasn't ONE WORD of thanks to Gomez within the quiz<br><br>I thought "now's my chance to acknowledge Gomez's help"<br><br>So,
 using Snarkbait's advice on loading screen "technique" I printed a 
series of lines of text to the screen as a dozen files were loaded<br><br>I
 STARTED with a thanks to Gomez, during loading from floppy there is a 
good time to read the "building text lines" but Snarkbait told me 
loading from www the text isn't there for long, oh well, either way 
'target' half achieved eh ?<br><br>NEXT<br>"Time out" mechanism removed<br>NEXT<br>there
 was room on the floppy for half a dozen .mids and the sole .mid 
currently used during the quiz was copied from the BB CD called "plain"<br><br>WHY
 I kept "plain" at all - now baffles me, it is DREADFUL, should have 
chucked it, still I reduced it's activation in favour of the others, 
which are called at various times<br><br>DON'T WORRY !<br>The whole lot can be DISABLED from a NEW music menu that I Added during this upgrade<br><br>there are now music options e.g<br>DISABLE music<br>call MP3<br><br>CALL MP3 searches your "My Documents" for a folder called 2 and then plays the first MP3 found inside there<br><br>I was so tickled pink with that I tell you, learnt quite a lot about files, loading/searching etc good fun<br><br>ALSO<br>A m8 of mine from Dorset had come down with his hard drive to burn me a CD of family photos<br><br>He happened to have 20 .mids going spare and I took the best half dozen .mids for use in the quiz<br><br>I think they're great and have built them in to various places<br>BUT<br>a problem with playing these .mids arose<br><br>for instance, one .mid is called EVERY TIME you access "PERSONAL PROGRESS" or any item from the blue menu<br><br>SO
 ..if you choose two or three items from the blue menu in quick 
succession the SAME .mid is called and starts all over again EACH POXY 
TIME<br><br>THIS is not good and "feels" real amateurish<br><br>the version of BB I was using then, I don't think, allowed "detection" of music playing/not<br><br>I found that PlayCDTrack track wasn't EVEN RECOGNISED as a command at all !!<br><br>anyway
 I gave up tryig to "detect" whether the music was playing, instead I 
read in the currentTime$() into a variable at the time ANY .mid was 
called<br><br>I then set up a subroutine that compared that time to Y<br>if the elapsed time was &lt; Y then the subroutine EXITED just as if music disabled<br><br>hey presto, music is generally far more "continuous" and the effect more "professional"<br><br>boy have I learned some stuff here I tell you<br><br>NEXT<br><br>well there's STILL room on the floppy for a README.txt<br><br>bung it in bung it in !!<br><br>so now there's a README.txt explaining all these wonderful features, crikey there's STILL some space left on the floppy<br><br>SOURCE<br>well SOMEBODY might be interested in the BB code eh ?<br><br>believe it or not, there was only room for one third of the BB source to fit into the remaining floppy capacity, oh well<br><br>FEEDBACK please<br>hey let me know what you think eh ??<br>chiefy.brown@tiscali<br>that's my e-mail address, just add co.uk to it, it's complete :-)<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>creation: virtual family website</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2002-05-09)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> I succeeded in putting a pretty good <a href="http://www.vitology.com/chiefy/quiz.zip" target="_blank"> quiz </a> together on a 1MB floppy.<br><br>I decided to do a virtual family website for my family/relatives, a lot of whom have PCs which are NOT on the www.<br><br>So I started saving photos onto a floppy. I then found that only 1.2 photos would FIT onto a floppy.<br><br>Nightmare! What sort of virtual website has just 1 photo?<br><br>So, I thought, what I need is a 700mb CD full of photos that I can draw at will under the control of a BB prog on a floppy.<br><br>So... 2 weeks later, my mate from DORSET arrives. He told me he was bringing his "CD burner"<br><br>When
 he turned up, I expected him to plug it in and just download my 600MB 
"avalanche" of photos onto a blank CD but - sorry, not quite that easy.<br><br>A CD Burner is contained WITHIN a computer tower, not loose.<br><br>He'd brought his whole computer system which he then proceeded to unbolt - screw by screw....<br><br>Flippin'
 heck mateys... brave or stupid - I don t know which anyway he first 
removed his 2nd hard drive and wired it onto my motherboard, what got me
 was he did this with the power on!!!<br><br>So.... several strong coffees later and with an eye on the fishes. temperatre guage stuck on the balanced "warm" drive......<br><br>...switch on, yes my computer had "detected" the DORSET drive 2, now a total of 15 GB memory, wow, awesome<br><br>now what?<br><br>well,
 chuck in a few more photos from the Dorset drive - might as well bring 
it up to the max 700mb eh? chuck in a few .wavs a few .mids that I can 
use in BB<br><br>and several hours later.... 677MB ready to burn onto a CD<br><br>marvellous: DO IT<br><br>oh dear "ERROR": the CD burner says NO..... why?<br><br>the
 CDS I bought are too new. Woolworths had run out of R74s and I had to 
get R80s, this flippin' burner doesn't KNOW what a poxy R80 is!!!! it 
won't recognise it!!!<br><br>you're flippin' kidding right!?<br><br>picture
 the scene, a bedroom with 2 cannabalised PC Towers, a smoking hard 
drive with the fish tank's temperature guage, tower cases bunged in all 
directions, a pack of 10 R80s stamped and trodden into the carpet and a 
fuming wife bleating "If you don't come for your dinner now, it'll be 
thrown over the back fence, just like last time..."<br><br>"Last time?" that was weeks back woman!<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>mcycle quiz</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2002-04-13)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> <a href="http://www.vitology.com/chiefy/quiz.zip" target="_blank">zip file</a><br><br>download my quiz game from zip on GOMEZ's site<br><br>he very kindly hosted it for me, it's 1MB and contains both .exe and .bb, please let me know what you think ;)<br>it

 the 1980s, taking a motorcycle driving test consisted of riding a 125cc
 motorcycle around the block with a pedestrian examiner jumping out 
shouting "STOP" as you looped back<br><br>this WAS the motorcycle 
driving test, amidst horrendous motorcycle accidents/crashes/deaths that
 were daily occurences in "those days" - a terrible mcycle death rate 
then : BUT NOW? far better/safer BECAUSE?<br><br>because of the upgraded training, THAT's WHY!<br><br><br>that horrific accident carnage was a joke, a sick joke<br><br>so, CBT came in!<br><br>I was a slick, suave, handsome CBT examiner, passing/training/failing mcycle novices before they could ride on L plates<br><br>hard work but worth it!<br><br>2001 saw the THIRD phase of motorcycle compulsory training added<br><br>NOW we have :<br>1) compulsory written (multi-choice) theory exam<br>2) CBT (practical riding skill/ highway code)<br>3) FULL driving exam<br><br>my <a href="http://www.vitology.com/chiefy/quiz.zip" target="_blank"> quiz </a> is designed to assist with SECTION 1, the theory test<br><br>GOOD LUCK MATEYS!<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
