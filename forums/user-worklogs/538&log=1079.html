 My next project for my new game is to get a very realistic and low 
overhead lens flare up and running.  That's my project over the next 
week, along with getting a basic level loader working.  I'm keeping my 
load light atm while the main character for my game is being finished 
up.<br><br>My demo level is going to be a wooded area up in Alaska.  So I
 have to do some research about the foilage and wildlife maybe up in 
Kenai.

 I did some preliminary testing today on Blitz's maximum packet speed.  
Seems about the fastest you can send/receive packets is approximately 
your monitor's refresh rate based on your cpu speed.  I'll be testing 
packet speeds between here and Florida later tonight.  It will give me a
 good idea of the max number of players blitz can handle under normal 
packet loads.  I don't want to speculate at this point, that's what the 
testing is for.  I'm sure any difficulties can be overcome with good ol'
 prediction routines.<br><br>I'm VERY happy with how clean the vector 
library is at this point.  It will make the physics engine that much

 Hiatus = over.  I stayed up late last night coding a UDP multiplayer 
library.  Since I'm not able to find the XNet module I was working on 2 
years ago (which is probably outdated by now along with every other 
multiplayer code from that era), I'm starting XNet from scratch using 
the latest techniques and whatnot.  XNet will be available through 
shareit.com in the very near future for a modest price.  It will embody 
the latest cutting edge multiplayer techniques coupled with the smallest
 packets ever.  Say it with me "The fastest Multiplayer library ever!".<br><br>The
 next library will be a complete physics engine similar to Tokamak or 
Havok.  Wrappers are great and everthing but there is a need for a 
native physics engine for blitz and so far no one has stepped up to the 
challenge.  Plus, I will be needing one for my future games.  This will 
also be available on shareit.com when completed.<br><br>The third 
library I'll be coding will be a completely customizable game menu 
system.  This library will allow you to construct full menu screens with
 highly advanced features.  <br><br>Libraries under construction:<br>1. Ultra High Speed UDP Multiplayer Library<br>2. Blitz Physics Engine<br>3.

 I'm unofficially back to coding after a long break (finishing up 
college).  So with degree in hand, I'm ready to get back to what I love 
to do most: program things I don't understand! =D<br><br>I think at this
 point to say that my flight sim will be based on WWII is a little 
premature.  How about I get the basica flight physics finished first.  
I've been modeling an F-100 Super Saber (a favorite of mine).  But since
 Third Wire released Strike Fighters recently, I'll probably go with the
 fictional WWII scenario.  <br><br>At this point, the flight engine is 
in it's infancy.  Gravity is completely done (oh that was a hard one 
=P).  Lift and Weight calculations are done and the aircraft actually 
lifts off the ground in a realistic fashion.  Now to tackle rotation 
forces.  That's what's tripping me up at the moment.  I've just ordered 2
 new physics books that will hopefully take the mystery out of angular 
forces, moments, inertia, etc.  It's not like bouncing a cube off a 
wall...trust me.  It's much harder.<br><br>I figure once i have the 
basic flight code done, I can have the other aspects completed very 
quickly.  The terrain system was completed 2 years ago and probably just
 needs a look over and some tweaking.  Same with the sky/weather system.<br><br>The
 vector library I posted in the archives helps immensely.  I also have a
 fully working quaternion and matrix library that I plan to post soon.<br> <br><br> [Core2D][Sprite][MaxVerlet] </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Air War 1946</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2003-02-06)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 I'm currently working on the Pilot Manager.  I'm including RPG elements
 in a sense that a player creates a pilot and assumes his role.  Players
 are awarded experience per airplane or ground object destroyed based on
 a number of criteria.  This ensures that a General will get little or 
no XP for shooting down a 2Lt.  <br>At this moment I'm creating a few 
different GUI's.  Yeah, I'm on a GUI kick at the moment since I'm just 
finishing up the launcher too.  I have the LaunchGUI, the 
GameMenuSystem, and another GUI I'm working on.  I'll probably be 
updating the Game Menu System that I have on BlitzCoder in the next 
couple of weeks with some minor upgrades.<br><br>Work on Air War 1946 is

 I have the core terrain system done and I'm very happy with the 
performance.  Now I'm optimizing it but I'm sure I won't see a speed 
increase since I have a Geforce 4.  Anyways, I just calculated that in 
order to make a box spin inside a box you have to reduce the inside box 
to .69 scale of the original box.  Now I just have to come up with a 
formula to not show the corner terrains since the inside horizon box can
 never reach to the terrain corners.  That and scrapping any redundant 
calculations should be it for the terrain.

 I've done some soul searching and came to the conclusion that rendering
 one HUGE terrain is both assinine and idiotic.  So, I've created a mesh
 based terrain system that renders the current terrain the player is in 
plus 8 surrounding terrains.  I've also coupled with this an object 
system that only shows objects if the terrain they reside on is 
visible...and to top that off I've added a custom EntityFade system 
(courtesy of Floyd) that fades in those objects on the specific terrain 
according to a specified range.  Yes...it needs more work but I'm quite 
happy with all these new methods.  <br><br>The one huge terrain seemed 
wasteful and getting good detail was proving very difficult.  Especially
 when the area of terrain you're trying to display is oh say...500

 I've started preliminary work on the sound engine.  Mostly it's for the
 radio chatter which can at times, become quite complex.  Especially 
when you have a bunch of .wavs you need to tie together to make a 
coherent sentence.  Say for instance you want to call your air control 
and request the heading for your next waypoint or back to base.  The 
sound engine will take the input from your request, match up the 
appropriate .wavs and play them in order....ie...first it would play 
"Turn to heading"...then play "2"..."0"...4".  Not that complicated but

 Started working out a realistic gun management system.  Each gun is

 I've just created a new weapons system that handles the rockets, 
missiles, and bombs separately from the cannons and guns.  Rockets, 
missiles, and bombs are created first by creating a pylon(bomb and 
missile) or a rack (rockets) and then "loading" the pylon or rack with 
the weapons.  The info for each weapon is stored in it's pylon or 
station type.  This makes for maximum versatility and lets the Armament 
screen load the plane with ease.<br><br>I've also implemented a Fire 
Mode...as in "do i want to fire the rockets one at a time or fire all 
24...pickle off one bomb or all.  <br><br>The R4M rockets (unguided) 
could fit 12 to a rack with a total of 24 rockets (some planes could 
hold 4 racks for a total of 48 rockets!).  Firing all 24 or 48 at once 
into a formation of B-17's was almost instant death to the bombers.  I 
am recreating that effect here.<br> <br><br> [Core2D][Sprite][MaxVerlet] </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Luftwaffe</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2002-10-05)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 I've gone back to redesigning the weapons systems.  They need to be 
much more dynamic than I had originally envisioned.  Each gun or station
 will be a separate object that will control itself based on it's 
"class".  Say you press the trigger on the joystick...all weapons that 
are class 1 type will fire off.  This means you can LINK guns and 
cannons to fire simultaneously.  The trigger will natively control guns 
and button 2 will control the selected weapon which can be cycled 
between cannons, rockets, missiles(yes, the germans had an air to air 
missle called the X4 on the drawing board!), and bombs.  Then by 
pressing a LINK key, it will automatically switch the cannons to class 1
 (guns are class 1).  Normally, guns are class 1, cannons 2, rockets 3, 
missiles 4, and bombs 5.<br><br>Aside from working out the new, more 
complex weapons platforms, I've been modeling new aircraft which will 
bring the total number of flyable aircraft to 8.  Here's a list of them:<br><br>1. Me-262<br>2. Me-163<br>3. Ta-183<br>4. He-162<br>5. Me-1092/2<br>6. Ho-229<br>7. Ef-128<br>8. Ba-349<br><br>The
 list may be cut by a few but the main website ( that's being worked on 
now), will have an aircraft download list so players who make their own 
planes can upload them (after I inspect them loosely just to ensure 
compatability).  I'll also be adding more planes for download myself.  
Those will be more exotic (triebflugel for instance).<br><br>Back to work I go...<br> <br><br> [Core2D][Sprite][MaxVerlet] </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>WarTanks Airstrafing</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2002-07-20)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">

 Mustang has finished up the JagdPanther and it makes a nice addition to
 the game.  We also have a Tiger II, Abrams, and FlammPanzer being
