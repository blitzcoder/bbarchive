 1. I've got some important things implemented into my new "tribal 
simulation" as I'm calling it.  I've got my food gathering system pretty
 much worked out.  Food is stored at the central hut.  When anyone in 
the tribe gets hungry, they go and take however much food it takes to 
fill them up.  When food stores get below a certain level, based on 
population, males go out and gather food.  In my studies I've learned 
that what hunter-gatherer groups eat is roughly 20% hunted, and 80% 
gathered.  So, when a tribesman decides to get food, he rolls a die and 
quite simply has a 20% chance to go hunting and an 80% chance to gather 
plants and berries.  Simple to implement.  If food stores get 
dangerously low, women will to go out and gather, but only fruits and 
vegetables.  The women do not have the option to hunt.  If game numbers 
are very low, an intelligence check is performed to see if the hunter 
will still hunt, or know enough not to kill animals with such a low 
population, which may cause extinction in the area.<br><br>2. I've also 
created a naming system which produces some funny names for my little 
simtribesmen.  When they are created(in startup) or born(in-game) each 
picks a random name from about 30 first names and roughly 40 last names.

 I'm using this food chain simulation as a building block for my next 
project, which is still in it's infancy.  I want to take this project to
 the next level: human interaction with it's environment. Much of the ai
 programming I've implemented in this simple program can be used in my 
next project.  Things such as each creature's "wants" and now genetics 
will carry over nicely.  <br><br>I want to simulate a paleolithic 
hunter-gatherer society next.  It's relatively straightforward when you 
look at it plainly.  I simply put myself in their shoes and ask: "What 
would I do?"  Is there food to eat right now?  If there is, do something
 else.  Is there food to eat tomorrow?  If not, I better get some food 
today, so I can eat tomorrow!  Does it make sense to walk 1/2 a mile to 
get nutrient-rich food or do I eat low-nutrient food that is 1/10th a 
mile away?  There is enough food for my me, but what about the children 
in the tribe?  Do they have enough food?  Naturally the need for food is
 at the top of the list, superceding the need for shelter, or the need 
to make another basket, or whatever.  Food in hunter-gatherer tribes is 
usually only stored for a few days at most, so there will always be a 
need for the gathering of food.  Another interesting point I want to 
implement is that while hunter-gatherer groups usually only supported 
10-30 individuals, each hunter or gatherer only spent about 15 hours per
 week actually collecting food.  These societies have rich social lives 
because 15 hours per week is only about 9% of the time, each week.  This
 leaves a great deal of time for thinking, playing, socializing, 
storytelling, teaching, etc, and from what I've learned led to the 
revolutions in science at the time.  So with that, I'll also have to 
implement some sort of social society.  <br><br>But first things first, I have to get some 3d "tribesman" out searching for food. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Updates</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2008-09-05)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Edited 12/26/08<br>I don't think I ever posted a link to the new, updated file, so here is a link to it.<br><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?ohlxn2yhnh4" target="_blank">http://www.mediafire.com/?ohlxn2yhnh4</a><br>Updated 9/4/08<br><br>1.
 The simulation will now restart if all creatures have died out.  Each 
time the program restarts, it will be noted as a "generation". How many 
generations have passed will now be read out at the top of the screen.<br><br>2.
 Mammals now have the ability and the desire to eat plants as well.  
They will no longer just eat insects.  They do however, prefer insects.<br><br>3.
 The insect birth rate has been reduced by approximately .02%.  While 
this seems very low, it is the chance that a well-fed insect that is 
currently looking for a mate, will mate and have offspring.  A .02 
chance, multiplied by, for instance, 200 insects, is 4.  So in this 
case, the possibility of insect birth each cycle has been reduced by 4%.
