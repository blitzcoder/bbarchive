 Previously the game was about running up the map until the end was 
reached. To make it a bit more interesting I have added a prisoner at 
the top of the map and changed the goal into a rescue mission. The 
player has to travel North, get the prisoner out of the prison and then 
lead him back  to the spaceship at the start.<br><br>Only if the 
prisoner is rescued, ammo supplies will be available to the player for 
the next mission. The player can still leave without the prisoner, for 
instance if he gets intro a hurry or if the prisoner is killed, but the 
lack of new ammo and health will then be a problem on the next mission. 
The prisoner can be hurt by enemy bullets as well as player bullets, so I
 am hoping for extra kinds of interaction and situations where the 
prisoner gets in the way. The goal of the game as a whole is for the 
player to reach a high level. Each level will be longer than the 
previous one.<br><br>In the meanwhile mouse control has been added and 
is working very well. The right mouse button can be used to quickly use 
the knife while the middle mouse button (or wheel press) can be used to 
throw a grenade. This can still also be done using the keyboard. <br><br> ---------------<br><a href="http://www.foppygames.nl/" target="_blank">Foppygames</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>New control method</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2010-09-19)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 I am continuing work on Ranger. The keyboard-only controls of this game
 have become a bit too complex I feel: rotate left/right, move 
forward/backward, strafing, shooting, reloading, changing weapons, 
throwing grenades, stabbing with the knife, applying medikits... because
 of this I am now experimenting with using the mouse for aiming, and 
WASD for absolute movement.<br><br>This will allow for precise 360 
degree aiming, and for simple 8 directional movement. Now I still have 
to think about how to control grenades and the knife, namely which 
buttons to use for those. Maybe a few buttons that are close to WASD. (I
 will take different keyboard layouts in consideration at a later stage 
so it's also playable on German keyboards, for example.)<br><br>After 
this change I expect the game to be easier to play, even with larger 
numbers of enemies. I also want to work towards a finished game, so 
instead of thinking of yet more enemy types and backgrounds I would 
rather use what I have now, throw a lot of enemies at the player and see
 how far they get. <br><br> ---------------<br><a href="http://www.foppygames.nl/" target="_blank">Foppygames</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Medikits</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2010-04-06)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> <b>Added:</b><br><br>- hits can cause maximum of 3 wounds that bleed and slow creature down until treated<br>- medikit pick-up (creature can carry 3) that heals all wounds and restores full energy when M key is pressed<br>- weapon shot from hands can now be picked up again by player<br>- ammo bunker, each level will probably have one, containing weapons and  medikits depending on level<br>- enemies will now fire salvos of random length when using machine guns<br><br>A
 single medikit will heal up to the maximum of three wounds and restore 
all energy, so a risky strategy could be to refrain from using the 
medikit until it is almost too late. This adds more variation and the 
possibility for different playing styles, compared to a medikit that 
fixes just one wound. (The latter approach would render the medikit a 
bit useless as a game mechanic as using it would become an automatic 
action to fix the most recent wound.)<br><br>The ammo bunker will 
contain weapons and medikits. It will be an important place for the 
player to visit, although weapons can also be picked up from enemies. (I
 will have to balance enemy weapon drop rates and the types of pick-ups 
placed in the bunker so that visiting the bunker is indeed important.) 
This will make the run from the bottom to the top of the map more 
varied, a bit like a secondary mission. The bunker could be guarded by 
strong enemies, or a large group of normal enemies.<br><br>Previously 
enemies just fired single shots at random, but now they can fire longer 
salvos, just like the player can by holding down the fire button. This 
makes the game much more difficult and also more fun. <br><br> ---------------<br><a href="http://www.foppygames.nl/" target="_blank">Foppygames</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>New video</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2010-03-18)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> I have uploaded a second work-in-progress video:<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVGZK07nWM" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVGZK07nWM</a><br><br>After this I should make no more videos but instead finish the game. &gt;:(<br><br>The video shows blood effects, grenades, craters, and guns being shot from hands.<br><br>In

 Grenades are now one of the types of weapons to be selected using the 
number keys. To make it easier to throw a quick grenade the player can 
also hold down the space bar (where X is the normal fire button), and 
after releasing the space bar a grenade will be thrown and the 
previously selected gun will automatically be reselected. I was using 
the space bar to open doors, but that is now done using the enter key.<br><br>Here's
 a picture that also shows new particle effects for ground being 
destroyed by exploding grenades, and the craters remaining afterwards.

 player will start out carrying no weapons, but a few will be next to 
him in the crashed space ship to be picked up. To give the player the 
necessary peace to pick these up I added a door to the space ship. Until
 this is opened the enemies cannot see the player. Now I can use doors 
in other parts of the levels too.<br><br>The doors had to move so I made
 an object called TILEANIMATION which controls which frames out of an 
image strip are assigned in sequence to a tile object, with the option 
to loop the animation. This can be used for other animations as well, 
for example I could animate the ship's dashboard or make a mud pool with
 bubbles.<br><br>For aiming I intended not to add a crosshair, because I
 like the idea of aiming with the gun itself. However the steps in the 
gun-rotation animations are quite large, and combined with blocky 
graphics this does not make for very good aiming. So now I have added a 
crosshair after all, floating in front of the player like in Airborne 
Ranger. I made it so that as you get close to a wall the crosshair will 
move towards you so as not to disappear in the wall. Another good reason
 for this crosshair is that I want to add grenades, and without a gun a 
crosshair would be required anyway for throwing the grenade.<br><br><b>Things I want to add:</b><br><br>(I might be too optimistic though.)<br><br>- grenades <b>(added)</b><br>- rockets<br>- ability to destroy walls  <b>(added)</b><br>- enemy and player can get weapon shot out of their hands <b>(added)</b><br>- enemies drop weapon when killed <b>(added)</b><br>- enemies can also pick up weapons <b>(canceled)</b><br>- eject empty shells from guns <b>(added)</b><br>- blood effects <b>(added)</b><br>- wounds that bleed and slow creatures down <b>(added)</b><br>- first aid kit pick-ups to heal wounds and restore health at the press of a button <b>(added)</b><br>- minefields <b>(canceled)</b><br>- z-ordering among creatures and bushes/furniture <b>(canceled)</b> <br><br> ---------------<br><a href="http://www.foppygames.nl/" target="_blank">Foppygames</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Video</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-12-17)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Latest additions:<br><br>- health bar, armor bar<br>- correct shadow color in different themes<br>- width of beam of fire based on gun<br>- player ship ("crash site") in first theme<br><br>I

seeing his ship go down.<br><br><img src="334&amp;log=1626_files/ranger20091217.html"><br><br>The
 theme of the game will be that the player has to fight his way to an 
enemy base where a rocket ship can be stolen to fly back home. The 4 
types of levels to be visited are a green one where the player crashed, a
 jungle, a desert-like brown theme, and an enemy base. I think every

 have picked four themes from the colors in the previous post. The 
player will play four maps with the different themes, one after another,
 and that will be one level. Then it's on to the next level, starting at
 the first theme again. I thought this would be better than playing a 
number of maps of the same theme in a row, because the player would get 
bored sooner, delete the game, send me a hate-mail and never see the 
other colors and enemies.<br><br>Line of sight stuff:<br><br>Line of 
sight will not be blocked by bushes. First of all this is tricky to 
program efficiently. Secondly I'm afraid it would make the screen too 
messy. It's a 2d game so playing with line of sight effects too much 
could lead to an unclear playing field, in what is still supposed to be 
an action game.<br><br>But the bushes do still block bullets when you are firing at them from a large distance, so they can be used as bunkers.<br><br>Enemy AI:<br><br>There
 now is basic AI in place. Enemies will start shooting when they see 
you, while also closing in. If you hide around a corner so they lose 
sight of you, they will most of the time investigate the spot you were 
last seen. This AI wil have to be extended quite a lot as it's an 
important part of the game.<br><br>Effects:<br><br>The arms of the 
creatures now move up and down while walking, as does the gun, which 
looks nice. I just use the offsets already computed for moving the feet 
up and down, applying them to the arms. (But switched around, so the 
left arm moves up when the right leg moves up.)<br><br>When shooting the
 creature is pushed backward a bit, depending on the power of the gun. 
This can influence gameplay as with the minigun the player will have to 
compensate for this. It makes the action of shooting less static and 
also counts as a kind of penalty for using the biggest gun. (I did some 
reading up on the feasibility of one man handling a huge machine gun and
 the necessary ammo, like my hero John J. Rambo does. My conclusions are
 this is incredibly realistic and therefore should be part of my action 
simulation!) <br><br> ---------------<br><a href="http://www.foppygames.nl/" target="_blank">Foppygames</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>New computer</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-07-20)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 A few weeks ago my computer stopped working. My most recent backups 
were from 2006 but for my current game I luckily made an online backup a
 couple of weeks before the crash. So I bought a new computer, with 
Vista on it and a wide screen. Now I have recreated the game to the 
point I left it at before everything stopped working.<br><br>To that I 
have added the use of a TILE type. Instead of the simple numbers and one
 big image file that I was using earlier I can now use different tile 
sets and store additional data for each tile. (Like I could add a 
"water" property and have splashing sounds be generated if somebody 
walks across such a tile.)<br><br>I thought that instead of just working
 on small things I should also work on bigger things like level 
structure. I am not quite sure but the game will probably have a large 
number of levels, with sets of levels sharing certain themes such as 
"green", "purple", "desert". I see now that I actually wrote "dessert" 
in the code but that would be a silly theme, with bits of pudding flying
 everywhere.<br><br>Here are some colors I tried for different themes. The walls, bushes and enemies can also be different for each theme.<br><br>Everything
 on the map is randomly generated so you can imagine it took me quite 
some time to create this set of similar images! -_-' Hehe..<br><br><img src="334&amp;log=1626_files/ranger20090720.png"> <br><br> ---------------<br><a href="http://www.foppygames.nl/" target="_blank">Foppygames</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Bushes</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-06-06)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Two types of bushes have been added. I am thinking about creating 
different settings, for example this green setting, a yellow "desert" 
setting, etc. For every setting there could be different types of

 will fly straight through the bushes when you are shooting at them from
 close range. Because of this the bushes can be used as bunkers: when 
shooting at them from a larger distance, the chance of the bullets being
 blocked increases. After several hits the plant is destroyed.<br><br>The
 bushes will also block your view, again depending on how close or far 
away you are from them. But this has yet to be added to the game.<br><br>Recoil has been added so a gun moves backwards when fired.<br><br>In
 addition, shadows have been added to bushes and creatures. These are 
just shapes in a dark green color that are drawn before anything else is
 drawn, so they appear under the objects. Of course when I add settings 
with different ground colors, the color of the shadows will also have to
 be changed. I could use black shadows in all cases. I suspect it won't 
look as good, but it is worth a try. This would have been easier in 
BlitzMax, using black shapes plus the correct alpha setting. <br><br> ---------------<br><a href="http://www.foppygames.nl/" target="_blank">Foppygames</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>3D walls and changes in features</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-05-29)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">

tiles.<br><br>Now it looks a bit more 3D:<br><br><a href="http://www.foppygames.nl/worklogs/ranger20090529.png" target="_blank"><img src="334&amp;log=1626_files/ranger20090529s.png"></a><br><br>A
 creature cannot enter a solid tile, but in creature-tile collisions 
only the main body of the creature is taken into account (and not the 
head, arms and legs). Therefore part of the graphics will move into the 
solid tile. This helps creating the 3D illusion as the character will 
partly disappear behind a wall or be drawn in front of it. (The walls 
and creatures are drawn in the correct depth-order with respect to each 
other.)<br><br>The screenshot also shows the new weapon interface, 
similar to that seen in Doom, with a number for each weapon, 
corresponding to the number keys. If the number is red that means you 
have no ammo for that gun. The selected gun and bullets and extra 
magazines for that gun are shown in the lower right.<br><br>A number of features will be changed or removed:<br><br>- The player starts with one or two weapons and can pick up new weapons (or collect ammo) found during the game<br>- No shop; the surroundings/enemies have to provide ammo and first aid kits<br>- No complicated inventory/backpack management<br>- No separate battery system; the laser guns also use magazines (which look like batteries) <br><br> ---------------<br><a href="http://www.foppygames.nl/" target="_blank">Foppygames</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Back to Blitz 3D</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-04-22)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 I have rewritten a considerable part of the game engine in Blitz Max, 
but progress was slow and for the last couple of months not much has 
happened. There are still no moving characters on the screen, while in 
the Blitz 3D version I already had creatures running around with guns. 
In addition to the boring aspect of rewriting the engine, I wasn't able 
to create a very flexible graphics mode system in Blitz Max (as noted in
 the previous post) which was the main reason to switch languages.<br><br>Because
 of all this I have now gone back to the Blitz 3D version. I will 
however change the resolution from 640x480 to 800x600 (as planned for 
the Blitz Max version) and am currently resizing the graphics. <br><br> ---------------<br><a href="http://www.foppygames.nl/" target="_blank">Foppygames</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>800x600</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-02-14)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Although I am of course still working in BlitzMax my game will probably
 not have the automatic graphics mode selector described in the previous
 post. It seems that GraphicsModes() returns modes that (perhaps 
depending on monitor drivers being installed or not) may not work well 
with the monitor. Adding a hard-coded checklist of common modes could 
partly solve this but I would never be quite sure about it. Another 
alternative of defaulting to the desktop mode seems nice at first but 
apparantly on larger resolutions this can also result in crashes.<br><br>So
 the plan is to stick with good old 800x600. In fact in the case of 
Ranger I was using 640x480 so this is quite a technological leap forward
 for Foppygames. ;)<br><br>The main reason for writing "Saucer Attack" 
was perhaps the graphics mode system. On the other hand it doesn't hurt 
to write game-related classes and to try other BlitzMax things that will
 also be needed in "Ranger". Right now I am adding sounds to Saucer 
Attack and for this I use <a href="http://www.cyd.liu.se/~tompe573/hp/project_sfxr.html" target="_blank">SFXR</a> by DrPetter, a great program for creating classic video game sound effects.<br><br><img src="334&amp;log=1626_files/saucer20090214.png"><br><br>What
 needs to be added is more effects, and first aid kits and temporary 
weapon power-ups that fall to the ground from destroyed enemies. After 
that I can start writing the basis for Ranger, such as the tile based 
engine. Last but not least I also want to say that I am enjoying the use
 of the <a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=83101" target="_blank">true type Blitz font</a> created by markcw. <br><br> ---------------<br><a href="http://www.foppygames.nl/" target="_blank">Foppygames</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Switching to BlitzMax</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-01-16)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 In order to support different resolutions and aspect ratios I have 
decided to switch to BlitzMax. Doing so means the game can pick a 
resolution that suits both the monitor and the game (as much as 
possible) and then either stretch the game in all directions to fit this
 resolution, or stretch the game to the extend where the game's original
 aspect ratio is still maintained and horizontal or vertical bars are 
drawn to cover the remaining screen area. (A third option would be to 
set windowed mode.) Last but not least the player can select a different
 graphics mode from a list of modes returned by BlitzMax.<br><br>The plan is:<br><br>1) Write a set of functions that implement the above idea;<br>2) Create a small game while writing those functions;<br>3) Convert the current 'Ranger' Blitz3D code to BlitzMax;<br>4) Continue writing 'Ranger' in BlitzMax.<br><br>Actually
 I am quite far into step one, and for step two I now have as much as a 
title screen being displayed. The test game I am writing is called 
Saucer Attack and will see the player controlling a flying saucer in a 
single-screen shooter. The funny thing is that although I have a 4:3 
monitor I write this game for 1280x800 widescreen, and I have set the 
code to use the "add bars" method (but the "stretch in all directions" 
method also works). So I can actually see the system working on at least
 one type of screen. ;) In the screenshot below I made the bars red so 
we can see what in the name of the Commodore 64 is going on!!<br><br><img src="334&amp;log=1626_files/saucer20090117.png"><br><br>The system works like this:<br><br>1) set 'virtual' (game) resolution<br><br>Now set a default 'real' (monitor) resolution using the following steps:<br><br>2) get desktop resolution<br>3) get all available modes (choose highest refresh rates in case of doubles) and store in list allModes<br>4) get all available modes from allModes where aspect ratio is same as desktop and store in list desktopRatioModes<br>5) pick a default mode from desktopRatioModes if non-empty, otherwise from allModes, using these rules:<br>- if desktop aspect ratio is wider than game, pick mode nearest in height to game<br>- if desktop aspect ratio is narrower than game (or equal), pick mode nearest in width to game<br>- in both cases, selected mode should not be higher/wider than desktop mode<br>6) set default real resolution<br><br>In
 other words, the system prefers to choose as a default resolution a 
mode that has the same aspect ratio as the desktop. Secondly it then 
looks for the resolution closest to the width or height of the game, and
 not larger than the desktop.<br><br>In step 6, the necessary offsets 
and scaling factors to get from virtual to real resolution are computed 
and stored. I have defined "wrapper" functions for the drawing functions
 that I want to use in the game; the wrapper functions take care of 
applying the scaling to the drawing location. Scaling on the image 
itself is done using a separate wrapper function for SetScale, and the 
drawing origin is controlled using SetOrigin. <br><br> ---------------<br><a href="http://www.foppygames.nl/" target="_blank">Foppygames</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Enemies in-game</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2008-11-14)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> I have recreated the two enemy types:<br><br><img src="334&amp;log=1626_files/ranger20081115.png"><br><br>(The picture was doubled in size for this worklog.)<br><br>A

 function that creates the random level can now also add "spawn points"

with actual enemy objects. The enemies however have no brains at the 
moment so they just stand there.<br><br>Strafing was added, at the 
moment activated using the Shift key. (Which is close to the current 
fire button X. I guess configurable keys would also be nice.) Strafing 
is only to the right and left, with simultaneous forward and backward 
movement still to be added.<br><br>Shotguns now use individual shells 
for ammo, while the minigun now uses a belt of bullets instead of the 
magazine that is used for machine gun and uzi. It makes it all a bit 
more complicated but I want to add a little bit of realism and variety 
here and there. With this in mind the minigun will also be using the 
battery for the spinning mechanism, and it will probably get a heavy 
recoil.<br><br><img src="334&amp;log=1626_files/ranger20081101.jpg"><br><br>I
 made this sketch of what the enemies could be like. Instead of typical

more like monsters. It has to be seen how well this translates to the 
animation system that uses separate body parts. So I will have a go at 
creating those in the game.<br><br>Next will be a simple AI routine to have to enemies look around, spot the player and fire their guns at him.<br><br>The
 function that checks whether the player can see each enemy will also 
store this information (and the angle from player to enemy) in the enemy
 objects; that way, the enemy AI function can decide whether the enemy 
can see the player without having to run the line of sight function 
again. <br><br> ---------------<br><a href="http://www.foppygames.nl/" target="_blank">Foppygames</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Gun graphics</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2008-10-09)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Progress is slowing down a bit. I have a full time job at the 
university which most of the time involves programming (which is fun, 
make no mistake). Then when I get home and make spaghetti or something 
and I am a bit tired, I sit down at the computer and listen to C64 or 
other electronic music and reluctantly and with a long sigh fire up 
"Graphics Gale" and "IDEal"... and the result is..<br><br><img src="334&amp;log=1626_files/ranger20081009a.png"><br><br>A
 set of gun graphics! The guns are pump action shotgun, double barreled 
shotgun, uzi, 'machine gun' (have to change that to something a bit more
 specific), mini-gun, zapper and blaster (which are a small and a big 
laser gun). It's a bit like the cliché gun set.<br><br><a href="http://www.foppygames.nl/worklogs/ranger20081009b.png" target="_blank"><img src="334&amp;log=1626_files/ranger20081009bs.png"></a><br><br>For
 each gun I made an animation strip of 36 frames so that means there's 
one frame for every 10 degrees of player rotation. Now I am in the 
progress of giving each gun category their own type of bullets, and each
 gun type should have its own settings for parameters such as firing 
speed and bullet speed. After that I should add basic enemies to test 
all this.<br><br>One problem I ran into was the ability to cheat by 
sticking the gun through the corner of a solid tile, thus shooting at 
(future) enemies while hiding behind a wall... I solved that by running a
 line of sight check from the center of the player to the end of the gun
 (the spot where the bullets originate on the screen). If there is no 
line of sight, that means the gun is in a wall and the bullet will not 
be launched. ;)<br><br>The player is not anymore in the exact center of 
the screen but instead the screen focuses on a spot slightly ahead of 
the player so that you can see what's coming. This spot is all the time 
being averaged with the previous focus spot. If I don't do that the 
screen motion as the player runs and rotates left and right is 
unpleasant and nausea inducing. <br><br> ---------------<br><a href="http://www.foppygames.nl/" target="_blank">Foppygames</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Weapon displays</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2008-09-18)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">

 shop. Thus the goal of the game is not to reach a top-score but rather 
to complete all levels.<br><br><b>Inventory space</b><br>Of each armor 
item (helmet, body armor, boots) the player can have only 1. The player 
can carry 2 different guns (but use only 1 at a time). For ammunition 
and extra equipment a total number of slots is available in a backpack 
(as in the Airborne Ranger game). Guns are not in the backpack.<br><br><b>Hiding from sight</b><br>The
 game uses a line of sight algorithm. Walls block vision; if there's no 
line of sight between the player and an enemy, the enemy is not drawn 
(thus invisible to the player) and the player's location is usually not 
known to the enemy. (If the player has the radar enabled, it will show 
dots representing enemies.) Player (and enemies) can hide behind/in 
bushes. How does this work? Line of sight is broken when it hits a bush 
in the distance. It is not broken when it hits a bush up close. This 
means when you are close to a bush, you can see through it and see 
enemies that are behind the bush. But those enemies, if they are a 
certain distance away from the bush, cannot see you. If you start firing
 or attract attention in another way, the rules change; they may not 
have seen you but they know you are there. (The enemies will store the 
location where they think you are. If you move away, they will not know 
where you are anymore but they will know that you are about.)<br><br><b>Hiding from bullets / firing from hiding place</b><br>Walls
 can never be destroyed and will always block bullets completely. To 
make for a more interesting playing field there will be bushes (or other
 objects playing the same role) for player and enemies to hide behind. 
Bullets will fly through bushes when shot at close range (compare this 
to the line of sight not being broken when the bushes are up close). At 
greater range, the bullets will hit the bush and damage it until the 
bush is completely gone. This makes bushes into a kind of bunker; the 
player hiding in/behind bushes can fire at enemies without destroying 
his own hiding place. Enemy fire (when from a distance) will be blocked 
by the bushes until these are destroyed. Should the enemy move in close 
range, their shots will go straight through the bushes. Grenades will 
fly over bushes but not over walls.<br><br>--------------------------------<br><br>Next on todo list:<br><br>- basic enemies (still haven't added them)<br>- a few types of weapons / ammunition<br>- the shop <br><br> ---------------<br><a href="http://www.foppygames.nl/" target="_blank">Foppygames</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Animation system</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2008-08-21)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> The animation system is working, for the player at least.<br><br><img src="334&amp;log=1626_files/ranger20080821a.png"> <img src="334&amp;log=1626_files/ranger20080821b.png"><br><br>As you can see, the player has a yellow helmet and orange feet and a stylish white gun.<br><br>The

there's a picture for every 10 degrees of rotation, allowing the player 
to aim reasonably well. Based on the angle, the parts are drawn in the 
correct order for depth-sorting. The feet move along a sine curve. While
 the player is shooting, rotation speed is lowered a bit to allow for 
more precise aiming.<br><br>The player is an instance of a "creature" 
type, and the enemies use the same type, so they will also use this 
animation system. I have to think about what types of enemies the player
 encounters and draw the body parts. I think the enemies will be 
humanoid and carry guns as this fits the animation system/body part 
count. (Although exceptions like "no visible gun" or "no arms" could of 
course be added.)<br><br>What's next on my todo list:<br><br>- level structure; go to next level after reaching the top<br>- basic enemies<br>- writing down a list of things that I want to add to the game <br><br> ---------------<br><a href="http://www.foppygames.nl/" target="_blank">Foppygames</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Random map</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2008-08-11)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 I am working on the random map part. Levels are a certain number of

else.<br><br>In the picture below the player has just left a "grid"

 Hi, I have started writing a new game, and thought it would be nice to 
create a worklog if only to keep myself motivated. (Since it has been 
some time that I actually completed a game.)<br><br>This game will be written in Blitz 3D but using only the 2D commands.<br><br>[Update January 2009: The game will be written in Blitz Max.]<br><br>[Update April 2009: The game will be written in Blitz 3D.]<br><br>The working title is 'Ranger' because I was inspired a little bit by the game Airborne Ranger. The basic idea is the following:<br><br>1.
 The player controls the 'ranger' in a vertical (perhaps also 
horizontal) scrolling world, viewed top-down but with characters drawn 
from the side to keep it interesting. The ranger can rotate and walk 
forward/backward using the arrow keys, and fire his gun, and perhaps 
select different weapons.<br><br>2. The game consists of levels. In a 
single level, the goal is to reach the 'top' of the map. Every level 
will be more difficult than the previous one. The player has to keep up 
with the increasing difficulty by a) picking up better weapons, b) 
buying better weapons in a shop. (I still have to decide.) The picking 
up weapons idea would be like in my game Fly Out. (In Fly Out the player
 has to be careful to actually grab the power up, or else the game could
 become overwhelmingly difficult.)<br><br>3. Obstacles in each level 
will be: walls and enemies. Walls and enemies are randomly set up at the
 start of each level. This is done randomly for two reasons: 1) more fun
 to play the game again, 2) easier for the programmer once the system 
works. Enemies will use a line-of-sight algorithm to spot the player. I 
want to make them a bit more interesting than enemies that simply run 
towards you; it should also be an option for them to stay where they are
 or perhaps run away.<br><br>I use my (unfinished) game Droidfire as the
 basis for this new game, and I started by removing everything except 
the basics which are:<br><br>- basic player and enemy characters<br>- scrolling tile background<br>- bullets<br>- collisions between everything<br>- font system<br>- sound system<br>- some special effects<br><br>I
 also removed mouse controls for aiming since i think it feels more 
direct if you control the character completely using the keys. Now what I
 have to create next is:<br><br>- a system for creating a random but playable map<br>- a system for character animation<br><br>The
 system for character animation will take a few elements (body, legs, 
arms, head) and use those to create an animation. It will display the 
character in birds eye view (3D). The feet will move like the character 
is walking, using perhaps a sine curve, like in my game Wizard Battle, 
only this can be done into a random direction (as the character can 
rotate).<br><br>Here is a picture of what the game looks like now:<br><a href="http://www.foppygames.nl/worklogs/ranger20080805.png" target="_blank"><img src="334&amp;log=1626_files/ranger20080805s.png"></a><br><br>I
 will remove the aiming cursor, assuming that the rotation/animation 
will be precise enough for the player to aim based only on that.<br><br>Here is a picture of Droidfire:<br><a href="http://www.foppygames.nl/screens/dfire3.gif" target="_blank"><img src="334&amp;log=1626_files/dfire3s.html"></a><br><br>(I started writing Droidfire in 2002, the unfinished 1 level game can be downloaded <a href="http://www.foppygames.nl/worklogs/droidfire_v0_4.zip" target="_blank">here</a> for reference.) <br><br> ---------------<br><a href="http://www.foppygames.nl/" target="_blank">Foppygames</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
