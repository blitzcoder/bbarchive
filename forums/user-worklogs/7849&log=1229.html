 the sake of having to set a limit, the engine now supports 26 
simultanious animations at varying framerates (this includes walking 
animations)<br><br>Oh yes.... Walking Animations, that bit of the engine
 that my testers have wanted for so long, they are currently testing a 
single walking animation and current feedback looks good, it is smooth 
and stable on all systems<br><br>for those of you who didnt see the forum posts, the system works like this:<br><br>Animation Details are stored in 2 arrays, 1 for numbers and one for text<br><br>The
 frames themselves are not stored in the arrays, just instructions 
identifieing which animation it is and the speed it is going at<br><br>Animations are set easily with a function that makes sure all the information goes in the right place<br><br>The
 play animation function scans through the animations and updates as 
apropriate, the function is run often and at all times, it is accurate 
to millisecconds<br><br>When an animation is finished it will either loop or be deleted (theres a function for that too)<br><br>I
 will probably make another function for preparing animations, one that 
would load the frames up into memory for the specified animation<br><br>There is also a function for searching the array, it returns a 1 if an animation is currently playing<br><br>I'm
 not sure right now of the possible lag effects on some systems, having 
26 animations all playing at different framerates could slow things down<br><br>Due to lack of feedback I'm not going to post any more builds here till things are more finished<br><br>-Mordax<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Updates</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2004-12-19)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Build 5 is ready, you can download it in the Showcase forum<br><br>Ive
 been thinking recently about Walking Animations, they are in high 
demand by my Alpha Testers so I think its time I made them a priority, 
the slowdown produced by them should allow me to remove the 
press-per-move system and replace it with a hold-to-move system that 
should be a lot nicer<br><br>Its time to start experimenting, normaly 
these would be easily done with Animations however with the colour 
editing system I have in place they may require a more unique aproch,

 Colour Substitution system allows you to have many copies of the same 
picture but all with different colors, and all comming from the same 
file<br><br>Basicly the engine masks the image for the colour to change,
 then clears the back buffer to the new colour, draws the picture and 
grabs it again, thus swapping the old colour for a new one<br><br>Its 
current aplication is in the Character Generator, which uses this to 
allow the player to pick hair, eye, skin and clothes colours<br><br>The 
dialouge system is something you can find out about for yourself as I 
will releasing the current Alpha version to the Blitz community<br><br>The
 source code is present, however in order to safeguard my repuation with
 the fickle minded masses I am holding the rites to it until the final 
release, I know all too well what can happen if things get out too early<br><br>If
 you would like the Alpha Version please provide me with the E-Mail 
address (by way of the "Seten Myrianon Alpha Release" topic in the Blitz
 Showcase forum) to send the link too, the link is not to be given to 
anyone else<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Graphics!</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2004-10-17)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Yesterday the engine made the jump from ASCII to proper graphics, there will be screenshots soon<br><br>As the end product will be Open Source I'll tell you a bit about how these graphics work<br><br>The
 engine's graphics center around 32x32 pixel tiles, in order to specify 
what tiles go where there are 2 things you need to do:<br><br>The fist 
is to specify tilesets, tilesets are collections of tiles with 1 
specific theme, all tilesets should have the same layout, I.e the top 
left most tile is always a floor tile, in code you change the tilesets 
stored in memory by changing the value of 2 globals called TS1$ and 
TS2$, and running a function called LoadTS(), this may later change to 
just a function LoadTS(TS1$,TS2$), but I will probably need to have 
access to TS1$ and TS2$ elsewhere so I will not be changing this till I 
know for sure, the second tileset is optional and should be set to 
"None" if your not using it<br><br>The second thing to do is make an 
RCode file (.RCode), RCode stands for Room Code, they are in essance 
just .txt files that have been re-named, so you can open them in 
notepad, the idea of changing the extention is to throw people off who 
may want to snoop around your room layouts, I have tested that this idea
 works by sending an RCode file to an expert Pascal coder who couldnt 
figure out what it was<br><br>Your RCode file will specify what tile 
goes where, each tile in your tileset(s) has a 4 letter code, each room 
is 15x15 tiles, so you simply type the codes in kinda like this:<br><br>[Code]<br>XXXX|SW1A|SW1C|SW1D|FW1A|FW1C|FW1A|FF1B|FW1A|FW1D|FW1A|FW1A|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|<br>XXXX|SF1A|SF1A|SF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|<br>XXXX|SF1C|SF1B|SF1B|FF1B|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1D|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FW1A|XXXX|XXXX|<br>XXXX|SF1A|SF1A|SF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|XXXX|XXXX|<br>XXXX|XXXX|SF1A|SF1A|SF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1D|FF1A|FF1A|FF1D|FF1A|XXXX|XXXX|<br>XXXX|SW1B|SF1C|SF1A|SF1A|SF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1B|FF1A|FF1A|FW1B|XXXX|<br>SW1A|SF1A|SF1A|SF1D|SF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1D|XXXX|<br>SF1A|SF1A|SF1C|SF1B|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1C|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|XXXX|<br>XXXX|SF1A|SF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|XXXX|<br>XXXX|FF1A|SF1B|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1C|FF1A|FF1A|XXXX|<br>XXXX|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|XXXX|<br>XXXX|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1C|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|XXXX|<br>XXXX|FF1C|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|XXXX|<br>XXXX|FF1A|FF1A|FF1D|FF1A|FF1A|FF1B|XXXX|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|FF1A|XXXX|<br>XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|<br>[/Code]<br><br>every
 block of 4 represents a tile, the engine will read the codes and store 
them in an array called M$(16, 16) of which the codes use 1-15 either 
way, it will then read M$ and place the apropriate tile<br><br>In the 
above example, XXXX represents a black tile, anything with F as the 
first letter comes from the first tileset while anything with S as the 
first letter comes from the second tileset, for the next letter F 
represents a floor, while W represents a wall, the other 2 letters 
specify the exact type, FW1A for example is First-Wall type 1A<br><br>Why not just go straght from RCode file to screen?<br><br>Well, M$ has its uses elsewhere as well, collision for example isnt done in a standard style for combat-mode related purposes<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Introduction</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2004-10-12)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> As you may have read on my supposedly confusing website I am infact coding an RPG engine<br><br>The
 "Myrianon" engine will be not only used in the hopefuly not too distant
 future to create games by me, but should also be released Open Source 
to other developers<br><br>So what eventual goals does this project work to:<br><br>The
 first is to create, develop and demonstrate hopefuly the most diverse 
RPG world in existance, my world "Seten" has quite a long fictional 
history and a lot more planned for later games spread accross the 
timeline of Seten, from its stone age to its space age, and while many 
RPG worlds will boast their diverse mix of terrain types from forests to
 swamps to deserts, to sowfields, very few indeed add their own terrain 
types to that list that dont exist on our own world, at the time of 
writing the world of Seten has been in design for about 4 years<br><br>The
 second, and far less likely goal is to bring the graphical 
"development" of the gaming industry to a halt and to instead force the 
industry to focus on gameplay development, this enhancement of gameplay 
is the focus of releasing the engine Open Source, I'm confident that 
what I have planed is the right way to do things and thus more amature 
RPG programmers will use the engine<br><br>The third and final ultimate 
goal of the engine is to provide me with a nice happy retirement, the 
fact that I'm 17 doesnt mean that I cant plan ahead, the money from any 
games I make with my engine will all go straght into a high interest 
bank account for use when I retire<br><br>So, how are things currently with the engine:<br><br>Well
 I currently have quite a lot of it to convert from other languages to 
Blitz, I'm finding that there are so many more efficiant options in 
Blitz that most of it is being re-written in the process, I'm also 
pixeling the graphics to be used in the sample game to be included in 
the engines code<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
