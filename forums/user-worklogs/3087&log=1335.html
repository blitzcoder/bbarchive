 Okay, so I've been implementing a lot of little things since the last 
update.  The idea is to get all the major game mechanics (eg. devices 
that you operate) in place and then I'll develop a sample level for each
 of the 5 main areas of the game.<br><br>This screenshot shows off a number of new developments:<br><img src="3087&amp;log=1335_files/gyroman_work_04.jpg"><br><br>Note
 for example that the flying gremlin is in the game and attacks you.  
I've also created actual graphics for all the standins, like the locked 
gates.  I've also implemented a simple damage model where if you get hit
 you start to emit smoke, and if you get hit again your gyrocopter 
explodes.  Oh, and at the top you can just see a shot from an automatic 
cannon; I've implemented a few traps like that.<br><br>Just a couple 
more devices to implement and then I'll do additional levels: 
grasslands, rivers winding through canyons, jungle, barren rocky desert 
(I actually already have this, but I'll make a new one,) and volcanic 
mountaintop.  I know, I know, cliche areas.  Hey, this is a simple 
shooter!<br><br>Once that's done I'll release the game's first demo. <br><br> -Joe Hocking<br><a href="http://www.newarteest.com/" target="_blank">http://www.newarteest.com</a> | Interactive Art and Experimental Game Design </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>grrr...</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-05-26)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> I love how the dates that I'm posting these has almost nothing to do with when the work was actually done. :P<br><br>Anyway, here's the flying gremlin I created:<br><img src="3087&amp;log=1335_files/fl_gremlin.jpg"><br><br>Putting
 him into the game of course involved a lot of code work for handling

lot of unglamorous (is that a word?) programming gruntwork, like 
building the UI system for the game (start menu, in-game HUD, that sort 
of thing.) <br><br> -Joe Hocking<br><a href="http://www.newarteest.com/" target="_blank">http://www.newarteest.com</a> | Interactive Art and Experimental Game Design </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>makeup!</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-01-02)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Now that I know the gameplay works, I wanted to turn my attention to 
the aesthetics of the game.  The first task there was texturing the test
 level:<br><img src="3087&amp;log=1335_files/gyroman_work_03.jpg"><br><br>In
 this screenshot you can also see a locked gate.  Well, a couple of 
blocks representing a gate anyway.  While I have other gameplay ideas to
 implement later, for now it is enough to have the find-keys/open-doors 
basics in place.<br><br>I think I'll model an enemy next.  I want to 
have a finished level to play in, so as menacing as they are, spheres 
aren't going to cut it. <br><br> -Joe Hocking<br><a href="http://www.newarteest.com/" target="_blank">http://www.newarteest.com</a> | Interactive Art and Experimental Game Design </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>really starting</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-01-02)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Fast forward to last fall: While tossing around ideas for my next 
project, I came back to Gyroman.  I realized there's real potential 
here, and effort-wise it would be a good ratcheting-up from my last 
game; a little more complex, but still simple enough to be manageable.<br><br>I
 got to work on the game's design.  I thought up a storyline, enemies, 
and world structure.  Before investing time designing levels, however, I
 wanted to implement a test-bed of actual gameplay, with enemies to 
fight and gates to unlock.  In particular, I was concerned about the 
handling of enemies, so I wanted to start prototyping ideas.  I roughed 
out a little maze:<br><img src="3087&amp;log=1335_files/gyroman_work_02.jpg"><br><br>Creating
 this test proved to be extremely productive.  I quickly devised a 
clever system for spawning enemies offscreen at a good pace, with 
enemies placed well for gameplay.  It's an actual game now, and even 
though it's all untextured primitives, it's already fun! <br><br> -Joe Hocking<br><a href="http://www.newarteest.com/" target="_blank">http://www.newarteest.com</a> | Interactive Art and Experimental Game Design </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>in the beginning</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-01-02)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Alrighty, it's been a little while since I wrapped <a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/gallery/view_pic.php?id=57" target="_blank">my last project</a>, so I'm getting to work on my next game.  Inspired by <a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/logs/userlog.php?user=6&amp;log=212" target="_blank">the worklog for Super Gerball</a>, I am going to be keeping a journal of my progress.  Hopefully I'll end up with as spiffy of a development diary.<br><br>A
 while ago (a looong while; a few years) I was working on a short-lived 
project in which, before things fell apart, we devised a clever gimmick 
for the player's control scheme.  I decided to take that interface idea 
and apply it to a new game design.  Because the controls enable the 
player to move and shoot in any direction independently of each other, 
resulting in some cool strafing action, I decided the character will be 
flying.  After a little brainstorming, I came up with Gyroman, a guy 
with a helicopter-backpack.  The character design was an homage to 
old-time radio shows about rocket-pack wearing pilots.<br><br>So, I 
modeled the character, and coded a little demo of moving around and 
shooting, in a landscape barren except for a couple primitives for 
obstacles:<br><img src="3087&amp;log=1335_files/gyroman_work_01.jpg"><br><br>Then, having implemented my little idea, I set this demo aside while I pursued other projects. <br><br> -Joe Hocking<br><a href="http://www.newarteest.com/" target="_blank">http://www.newarteest.com</a> | Interactive Art and Experimental Game Design </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
