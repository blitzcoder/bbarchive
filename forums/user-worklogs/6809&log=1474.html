 Today I've finished the first 'Solution Explorer' preview. that's great
 news becouse all this stuff has been built as a layer over the actual 
dependencies tree system, that makes all changes in a managed project 
automatically update the dependencies tree so, using managed projects, 
all intellisense and file dependencie relationship will be something not
 to care of. All the files are by default 'included' by the manager BMX 
file.<br><br>Here's a little snapshot of a BLIde managed version of the 
whole irrlitch engine, running full intellisense for all the pub, brl, 
irrlitch and some brucey modules at once, additionally managing all 
files, allowing user to move them from one folder to another, create and
 delete folders, rename files or folders, everything using the Solution

 Managed projects development for BLIde is being completelly rewriten. 
I'm creating a beta testers team for forthcoming beta versions, but beta
 testing phase will begin in a month or so. If you're interested on beta
 testing next BLIde versions, don't hesitate to send me an email (email 
on profile)<br><br>Currently I'm spending most of the little BLIde 
development time on low-level programing, trying to make things even 
faster and lightweight. Latest build (0.9.10 c) had some compatibility 
issues with 64 bits versions of Windows, wich have been fixed on 0.9.12 
a. All of them were caused by a compatibility issue on the 64 bits 
version of the .net framework so I have had to work arround this bug. 
But finally it has been completely fixed.<br><br>Reflection syntax is 
also understood by the code analizer, so transition from BlitzMax 1.24 
to 1.26 using BLIde has been, in most areas, instant.<br><br>The first 
steps on the beta-testing will be a design-discussion for the BLIde 
managed projects internal desing. All of you are wellcome to join the 
team. <br><br> ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯<br>Manel Ibáñez    ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/forum/" target="_blank">BLIde comunity</a> ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/" target="_blank">BLIde official Web Site</a> ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/BLIde_manual.pdf" target="_blank">BLIde manual in PDF</a> If you're using BLIde as your regular IDE for BlitzMax, please consider  <a href="http://www.blide.org/?page_id=302" target="_blank">getting the BLIde Plus! version</a> to support development. <a href="http://www.blide.org/?cat=5" target="_blank">Visit my BLIde development Blog!</a>  and get the Open Source <a href="http://sound3d.googlecode.com/" target="_blank">Sound3D module</a> for minib3d<br> <br>Dual 2 Core 2.8 (Windows 7) with ATI Mobility Radeon 4650 on a nice new Vaio :D </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Additional improvements soon</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2007-09-18)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 After making some tests, I've decided to addapt BLIde files management 
to the Microsoft directives so all BLIde user configuration and tmp 
files will be alocated in the documents area of the current BLIde user. 
This will solve a lot of problems with the (sometimes) problematic 
virtualization mechanism. <br><br>I encourage to everyone to store his 
or her projects also in the windows documents folder. We've got some 
reports of people that when editing the same file on different users 
acounts the changes on one account was not reflected in the other and 
vice-versa, so they were loosing changes. All of this drama caused by 
the 'not so clever' virtualization routines of Vista will be addressed 
following Microsoft directives.<br><br>This change will not affect 
modules development, so all advanced Blide for BlitzMax users developing
 modules may take care of the file permisions in the MOD folder "by 
hand". there's not much we can do there.<br><br>We're also introducing some minor improvements:<br><br>-Additional color / style options for the display matching braces mechanism in the BLIde text renderer<br><br>-Speciffic hilighting for BLIde directives, such as Region, Summary or bbdoc:<br><br>-General improvement of the 'mouse hoover' mechanism. Now the info window is being displayed in some unwanted situations.<br><br>-New
 SetUp engine for BLIde that will let you install REAL patches, making 
the patches update BLIde properly, so you don't have to uninstall and 
install again every time. Also, the patches will have a smaller size<br><br>-Some corrections on case normalization for some keywords.<br><br>-Some
 improvements in the error report mechanism when dealing with the 
BlitzMax BMK utility. BLIde will be able to report more detailed 
information in some situations when a bug happens at link time, at 
assembling time, or at non-bmx source code compile time. <br><br> ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯<br>Manel Ibáñez    ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/forum/" target="_blank">BLIde comunity</a> ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/" target="_blank">BLIde official Web Site</a> ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/BLIde_manual.pdf" target="_blank">BLIde manual in PDF</a> If you're using BLIde as your regular IDE for BlitzMax, please consider  <a href="http://www.blide.org/?page_id=302" target="_blank">getting the BLIde Plus! version</a> to support development. <a href="http://www.blide.org/?cat=5" target="_blank">Visit my BLIde development Blog!</a>  and get the Open Source <a href="http://sound3d.googlecode.com/" target="_blank">Sound3D module</a> for minib3d<br> <br>Dual 2 Core 2.8 (Windows 7) with ATI Mobility Radeon 4650 on a nice new Vaio :D </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Blide helps you get optimized code</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2007-09-13)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Latest update 00.09.07 introduces several security fixes, one of them 
releated to some vista-issues. this latest update works well under .net 
2.0 and better on .net 3.0 with dual core processors. Yes, I've got a 
new computer!<br><br>One of the things that I like most of this new 
update, is the fact the the results of the code analizer can be 
displayed directly in the code window.<br><br>snapshot.<br><img src="6809&amp;log=1474_files/blide-00-09-07-scr01.html"><br><br>You
 can see the waveline under the variable name, and the tip that appears 
when the mouse is placed and leaved over the buggy line of code.<br><br>This
 update also fixes some uggly and weird behaviour with intelliprompt 
autolists when using the backspace key. this has been solved to make it 
work exactly in the same way it works on Visual Studio IDE<br><br>In 
addition, I've discovered that, under vista, when you install a BLIde 
update, you have to set the file permissions for BLIde again (thay are 
not remembered by Vista). So all vista users, keep it on mind if you 
don't want to see BLIde waiting for ever when requesting for a speciffic
 file to the OS, unless you follow explicitly microsoft directives and 
store all the source code and executables on the 'documents' folder. 
Obviously if you're developing modules, you have to ignore Microsoft 
directives. :(<br><br>A part from this new version, we're having some 
progress on the new managed project mode. The managed project mode will 
be a new project management system that will deal with your project 
files and folders as you would do on windows explorer. You will be able 
to create new files from there (and them will be properly added to the 
project in a 'transparent way'), you will be able to move files, etc, 
without having to change a single include statement. In other words, 
this new mode will mimic in most ways the project management performed 
by applications like Visual Studio IDE.<br><br>This new mode will have the following specs:<br><br>-A
 main BMX file for each program (EXE, MOD, Plugin) will be generated by 
BLIde. This file won't be editable and will be used to manage all the 
import and include statements. So when you add / move / rename or delete
 any file from the Managed Project Explorer, this file will be also 
properly included in the project, exluded, renamed, etc. there will be 
no need to update the project tree any more!<br><br>-The other thing is 
that managed projects will be SUPERSTRICT or STRICT. bugy traditional 
relaxed code will not be supported as the STRICT or SUPERSTRICT 
directive will be hardcoded in the self-generated BMX file.<br><br>-Any 
application will have a FUNCTION MAIN() This function will be the 
starting point of the application. (anti-c coders are welcome to shout) 
 This is absolutely needed becouse otherwise BLIde would have to provide
 a build order engine to prevent orphaned code from destroying your game
 logic when the included files are included in a different order (as a 
result of a file drag and drop in the managed project explorer, as 
instance).<br><br>Obviously, the current unmanaged projects will continue to be suported.<br><br>Suggestions are welcome.<br><br>:D <br><br> ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯<br>Manel Ibáñez    ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/forum/" target="_blank">BLIde comunity</a> ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/" target="_blank">BLIde official Web Site</a> ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/BLIde_manual.pdf" target="_blank">BLIde manual in PDF</a> If you're using BLIde as your regular IDE for BlitzMax, please consider  <a href="http://www.blide.org/?page_id=302" target="_blank">getting the BLIde Plus! version</a> to support development. <a href="http://www.blide.org/?cat=5" target="_blank">Visit my BLIde development Blog!</a>  and get the Open Source <a href="http://sound3d.googlecode.com/" target="_blank">Sound3D module</a> for minib3d<br> <br>Dual 2 Core 2.8 (Windows 7) with ATI Mobility Radeon 4650 on a nice new Vaio :D </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Better intellisense and more things.</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2007-09-06)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Just spent the last week making some improvements to the BLIde internal
 intellisense API, and now the backspace character is also throwing 
context-based autolists with pre-entered text matching. This has been 
very complicated to make using the abstraction layer BLIde provides in 
its API. The good news is that the BLIde SDK will beneffit from this, as
 there will be a new GUI item able to hilite and fold BMX source code.<br><br>A first preliminar beta of this SDK is to come very soon.<br><br>Some
 additional improvements are that BLIde will now serialize the layout 
when a BLIde project is saved, so when the project is re-loaded, all the
 BLIde windows, panels and open documents will be exactly in the same 
state they where when the project was saved the last time.<br><br>As always, all this changes in the BLIde file format are back-wards compatible with previous versions.<br><br>There
 are also some improvements on the debuger and on the BPP interpreter 
that now works about 2 o 3 times faster in all the plug-in 
comunicactions, allowing a double threaded execution of plugins :D (dual
 core optimized, obviously).<br><br>We're also creating a new  parser 
system, that will be able to read a language description from a 
intermediate file, and compile them at run time. This will let BLIde 
support additional file formats. The end user will be able to configure 
BLIde to support any language they know or create. This run-time 
generated parser will not be XML interpreted based, but compiled to 
bytecode executed by a real internal virtual machine. <br><br> ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯<br>Manel Ibáñez    ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/forum/" target="_blank">BLIde comunity</a> ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/" target="_blank">BLIde official Web Site</a> ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/BLIde_manual.pdf" target="_blank">BLIde manual in PDF</a> If you're using BLIde as your regular IDE for BlitzMax, please consider  <a href="http://www.blide.org/?page_id=302" target="_blank">getting the BLIde Plus! version</a> to support development. <a href="http://www.blide.org/?cat=5" target="_blank">Visit my BLIde development Blog!</a>  and get the Open Source <a href="http://sound3d.googlecode.com/" target="_blank">Sound3D module</a> for minib3d<br> <br>Dual 2 Core 2.8 (Windows 7) with ATI Mobility Radeon 4650 on a nice new Vaio :D </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Compiler directives and managed projects (solutions)</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2007-08-26)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 We've finished adding a speccific hilighting routine for compiler 
directives. This new hilighting will be available on the next BLIde 
version, with some additional fixes on the smart text formater, and some
 important fixed on the unicode / international support. Also some 
improvements to the debugging area will be available.<br><br><br>We're 
also working on a "managed project" mode, that will mimic the project 
management of Visual Studio. There's a lot of work to do in this area, 
as the project management of BlitzMax is superior to the Visual Studio 
project management. I still have to find a good way to diferenciate 
includes and imports in a reasonable easy way. In addition to the 
managed project explorer (solution explorer in visual studio). This new 
managed project explorer is a sort of mixture of the 'project files 
explorer' and the 'dependencies project tree'.<br><br>One of the things 
that will make all this process easier is that BLIde will generate a 
'header' bmx file with all includes, imports and framework instructions 
automatically, so the final user will only have to deal with 'placing' 
the files in the desired locations and tell BLIde if those files are 
included or imported in the project.<br><br>It is still in a very early 
state, I'm dealing with an idea called 'import node' that could make 
things easier, especially when working with modules. <br><br>This 
managed project mode will be available on the free edition of BLIde, but
 will have some additional features in the Plus edition.<br><br>More info to come soon. <br><br> ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯<br>Manel Ibáñez    ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/forum/" target="_blank">BLIde comunity</a> ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/" target="_blank">BLIde official Web Site</a> ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/BLIde_manual.pdf" target="_blank">BLIde manual in PDF</a> If you're using BLIde as your regular IDE for BlitzMax, please consider  <a href="http://www.blide.org/?page_id=302" target="_blank">getting the BLIde Plus! version</a> to support development. <a href="http://www.blide.org/?cat=5" target="_blank">Visit my BLIde development Blog!</a>  and get the Open Source <a href="http://sound3d.googlecode.com/" target="_blank">Sound3D module</a> for minib3d<br> <br>Dual 2 Core 2.8 (Windows 7) with ATI Mobility Radeon 4650 on a nice new Vaio :D </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>A bunch of updates</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2007-08-18)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> After a bunch of updates and patches, everything seems to be as stable as spected.

 I've been fixing a lot of little issues found on beta 0.9.1, on of the 
most important ones is that edit actions (cut, copy, past etc) were not 
working properly when a quick info tip was shown on screen. This bug, 
that could seem a simple one to fix, has been driving me crazy dealing 
with windows messages... arrrgs... but I've got it fixed and working 
like a charm for the RC 1 version.<br><br>There have also been some 
fixes on outlining. Especially the usage of hexadecimal numbers was not 
being understood by the parser, and the usage of the array operators 
were providing parser errors in some very strange occasions.<br><br>The 
parsing speed has also been improved a little bit more, and the color

 will not be the color scheeme and font editor available on version 
0.8.17 b, becouse it is being also rewritten to support the whole set of
 parsers available for version 0.9.x (that is XML, HTML, C, C++ and 
LUA). The list of available parsers will be increased on future 
releases. We're working on a INI parser and a VBScript parser with 
folding. All this parsers will require a BLIde Plus license. BlitzMax 
parser will be, as always, completely free.<br><br>The preferences 
dialog is again 100% working, and this new BETA has been tested to be 
rock solid stable. we hope at the begining of next week, there will be a
 BETA 2 version available for public download.<br><br>Also the default 
welcome page has been redesigned to a more simple and IMHO better 
looking way. It also loads the news channel a lot faster making all the 
website access and download in a separated thread to 'fake' it is 
instant.<br><br>We're making also some changes to be ready to the new 
'reflection' stuff, There's not public information about this yet (as 
Mark always keeps things in secret untill they are ready for 
consumption) but we're implementing some little improvements to 
intellisense that go in this direction. More information to come as soon
 as we have more public information about any BlitzMax language 
change/improvement.<br><br>There has been also a major update on the 
wizards, updating the wizard control to a new underlaying system that 
(in further versions) will conform the Vista Wizard specification. Now 
BLIde conforms the Wizard 97 specification by Microsoft. Also, all the 
drawings in the wizard control, have been updated to work with the GDI+ 
architecture, so they look a little better.<br><br>So, a lot of work, designed to make BLIde faster and more standard. <br><br> ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯<br>Manel Ibáñez    ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/forum/" target="_blank">BLIde comunity</a> ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/" target="_blank">BLIde official Web Site</a> ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/BLIde_manual.pdf" target="_blank">BLIde manual in PDF</a> If you're using BLIde as your regular IDE for BlitzMax, please consider  <a href="http://www.blide.org/?page_id=302" target="_blank">getting the BLIde Plus! version</a> to support development. <a href="http://www.blide.org/?cat=5" target="_blank">Visit my BLIde development Blog!</a>  and get the Open Source <a href="http://sound3d.googlecode.com/" target="_blank">Sound3D module</a> for minib3d<br> <br>Dual 2 Core 2.8 (Windows 7) with ATI Mobility Radeon 4650 on a nice new Vaio :D </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>BLIDE 0.9.0 QW BETA 2 progress</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2007-07-02)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> After all the possitive feedback on the BETA 1 for the new BLIde core engine, we're working to fix some little issues:<br><br>1.-
 Code separators: code separators (those lines in a End Function or End 
Method keywords) were not properly updated when changing from one 
document to another. This has been already fixed for next update<br><br>2.-Project
 Dependencies Tree: Single click on the project dependencies tree was 
selecting the clicked item, that was causing that when a node in the 
tree was expanded, the document was automatically selected in the edit 
window. This has been solved to work in the same way it was working on 
version 0.8.17 b<br><br>3.- A new ultrafast mode will be available. This
 mode disables folding, but enables the edition of very big sourcecode 
files at nearly 0 CPU cost. <br><br>4.-Parenthesis matching hilighting is also performed in the next Beta version<br><br>5.- LUA support will be back there for all BLIde Plus users.<br><br>6.- There will be a Lock window mechanism that will prevent users to un-arrange the BLIde Layout by mistake<br><br>7.- The file being edited will be automatically chosen in the local shortcuts tree to make navigation throug source code easier.<br><br>8.- Additionaly C++, C, XML and HTML hilighting will be enabled on next BLIde BETA<br><br>9.-
 There will be a new Window menu, with a list of all the opened 
documents (selectable) and some visualization options, like 'new 
horizontal tab group' or 'new vertical tab group' like in visual studio 
2005. There will be also an 'auto hide all windows' mechanism.<br><br>We're still working in the preferences dialog, and as soon as it is updated, the BETA 2 will be released. <br><br> ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯<br>Manel Ibáñez    ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/forum/" target="_blank">BLIde comunity</a> ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/" target="_blank">BLIde official Web Site</a> ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/BLIde_manual.pdf" target="_blank">BLIde manual in PDF</a> If you're using BLIde as your regular IDE for BlitzMax, please consider  <a href="http://www.blide.org/?page_id=302" target="_blank">getting the BLIde Plus! version</a> to support development. <a href="http://www.blide.org/?cat=5" target="_blank">Visit my BLIde development Blog!</a>  and get the Open Source <a href="http://sound3d.googlecode.com/" target="_blank">Sound3D module</a> for minib3d<br> <br>Dual 2 Core 2.8 (Windows 7) with ATI Mobility Radeon 4650 on a nice new Vaio :D </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>BLIDE QW 0.9.0 BETA 1 Available</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2007-06-29)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 There a first BETA version of BLIde 0.9.0 with the new BMX dedicated 
parser available for download. This version has not 100% of the 
functionalities found on version 0.8.17b (current official stable 
release).<br>Restrictions:<br><div class="quote"> -Preferences dialog: some preferences are ignored by the new parser, this will be done in the BETA 2 version.<br><br>-Define
 editor colors and fonts: This section is being completly re-written, 
and it is not yet available. If you open it, you'll get a wonderful 
crash. Don't report it, it is a known issue we're fixing now.<br><br>-Split Views: Intellisense is only present on the main split view.<br><br>-Ctrl+Space is not suported yet. It is being rewritten to support some additional features.<br><br>-BLIde Plus is not suported.

 -There are some (very little) missing keywords such as DebugStop, and 
compiler directives such as ?Win32, ?MacOs, etc. Them willbe added on

 support is now available for beta-testing, but it will be restricted to
 BLIde Plus users). LUA is not yet supported in this first BETA<br><br>-Folding
 regions are updated on a separated thread, this can introduce some 
little delay updating folding regions. Nothing important once you get 
used to it, and it provides a huge parsing speed improvement.<br><br>-New Print options, much more complete including page size and printing options dialog.<br><br>-If sentences have folding, even on single line Ifs<br><br>-Using complete modules hilighting doesn't introduce any performance hit :D <br></div><br><br>You can download the beta here:<br><br>server: <a href="ftp://ftp.blide.org/" target="_blank">ftp.blide.org</a><br>username: scy4250<br>password: beta<br><br>This
 BETA is not a set-up ready application, so it can be runned without 
installing, just directly from the unzipped folder. To run it, click on 
the file BLIde.exe<br><br>The first time you run the beta, it will tell 
you that the BLIde database is corrupted, so BLIde will restart and fix 
it automatically. That ok, becouse there's no database supplied with 
this BETA version. Don't report it as a bug, please.<br><br>It would be 
great to have feedback regarding usability and parsing speed, in 
addition to any BUG you get. Remember that as a BETA version it is 
recomended to try it using copies of your source code.<br><br>There will
 be a second beta ASAP with some of the missing features implemented, 
and a optimized project loading algorithm that loads projects about 3 
times faster. <br><br> ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯<br>Manel Ibáñez    ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/forum/" target="_blank">BLIde comunity</a> ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/" target="_blank">BLIde official Web Site</a> ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/BLIde_manual.pdf" target="_blank">BLIde manual in PDF</a> If you're using BLIde as your regular IDE for BlitzMax, please consider  <a href="http://www.blide.org/?page_id=302" target="_blank">getting the BLIde Plus! version</a> to support development. <a href="http://www.blide.org/?cat=5" target="_blank">Visit my BLIde development Blog!</a>  and get the Open Source <a href="http://sound3d.googlecode.com/" target="_blank">Sound3D module</a> for minib3d<br> <br>Dual 2 Core 2.8 (Windows 7) with ATI Mobility Radeon 4650 on a nice new Vaio :D </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>BLIde 0.9.x first impressions</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2007-06-22)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 The integration of the NEW API is being very complicated, but it is 
revealing a huge performance improvement. Project loading time is the 
same as current version, but parsing speed is ultra faster, and <b>CPU usage while real-time parsing text has been 83% reduced</b> in my computer. The good news is that the Stand Alone Parser has the same speed when used on BLIde with full intellisense.<br><br>There
 are some little issues, such as folding working in a different way, it 
is very compatible with current BLIde official version, but it has some 
display diferences.<br><br><b>The ultra good news are that this version 
will have a dedicated parser for HTML and XML (with folding), and a 
hiliter parser for C, C++ and Assembler (BLIde Plus requiered).</b><br><br>There
 have been some security issues with the BLIde Plus Registration, that 
forces us to send a new username and activation code to all BLIde Plus 
users. All BLIde Plus users will get also an external executable 
activation file.

 From now, there will be only maintenance updates on 0.8.x versions of 
BLIde. We're working on version 0.9.x with the new Quantum Whale parser.
 <br>We've started the integration of the finished new parser to the 
BLIde internal API. I'll let you know when the first alha version is 
available, but it seems the new parser is about 15 times faster than the
 current one, based on Actipro technology. The strong point of this new 
parser is that it is a completly hardcoded dedicated parser for the 
BlitzMax syntax.<br><br>As soon as we get a working Alpha version, we'll provide download links for all interested users. <br><br> ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯<br>Manel Ibáñez    ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/forum/" target="_blank">BLIde comunity</a> ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/" target="_blank">BLIde official Web Site</a> ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/BLIde_manual.pdf" target="_blank">BLIde manual in PDF</a> If you're using BLIde as your regular IDE for BlitzMax, please consider  <a href="http://www.blide.org/?page_id=302" target="_blank">getting the BLIde Plus! version</a> to support development. <a href="http://www.blide.org/?cat=5" target="_blank">Visit my BLIde development Blog!</a>  and get the Open Source <a href="http://sound3d.googlecode.com/" target="_blank">Sound3D module</a> for minib3d<br> <br>Dual 2 Core 2.8 (Windows 7) with ATI Mobility Radeon 4650 on a nice new Vaio :D </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
