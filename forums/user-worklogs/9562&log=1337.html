 A big problem make that. The only 3d modiler I have ever been familiar 
with doesn't support .x files (Maya PLE they just have .mp) (I found 
this out a few weeks ago It's just I finally got the chance to get in my

still working on them with the help of a new book, (insert book's name

 creates build points to build various structures such as Aircraft dome,
 mine(gives you rescources inside the planets crust so you can use these
 for your nanobots to power them while they build the structure vehicle 
or weapon)You have 1 weapon at the start (pistol) but when you build an 
armory you can build more weapons (sniper rifle, gattling gun, rifle,

 post some new buildings for this work log please don't Try to hunt me
