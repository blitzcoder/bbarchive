 i do is, cos as i said, every single time you change a character in the
 source, a background thread is spawned that compiles the source, now 
that's modified to TAG the token and ParseNode that reside at the active
 cursor.<br><br>so through this i can back travel through the tree and 
perfectly determine what tokens and variables are valid for code 
compilation.<br><br>I dare say it'll end up being better than VC#.<br><br>All this in a week...MaxIDe sucks because? :) <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Nothing rythmes with IDE</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-12-07)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Automatic formatting sound good to you? It should.<br><br>Totally
 overhauled the internals and now it's all threaded. i.e whenever you 
compile or execute, it's done on a unique thread. and since the compiler
 is a object this means you can compile for example 80 programs at once,
 all on their own thread.<br>This also takes advantage of multiple 
cores. so you shoul see some really nice compile times on high end 
systems with multiple cores on multi-file projects.<br><br>Why did I do 
this though? For that VC# effect of course. every time you change a 
single character a background thread is spawned that recompiles the 
newly edited source and with this it can create detailed visual aids, 
classw/var lists and more, all AS YOU WRITE not WHILE YOU EXECUTE<br><br>so right now i'm about to add automatic formatting that will use the RDP tree to construct the precise formatting of the code. <br><br><br>so you could type, <br><br>class program<br>{<br>static int main(string[] args)<br>{<br>}<br>}<br><br>with no formatting, and the split second it becomes compilable code, it will automatically format and ident the source code.<br><br>remember
 ALL done in background threads, so there is no pause as you edit. if 
you type typing half way through the compile, it simplys aborts the in 
process threads and spawns new ones.<br><br>The entire engine will be 
scripted. you will be able to spawn real hardware threads for your 
functions and thread-safetly is inherently built in, meaning you just 
will need to do,<br><br>static threadsafe int x,y<br><br>and the engine will lock and release mutexes on those variables for you.<br><br>threadsafe will be usable on any variable type.<br><br>I'm
 also going to add a revolutionary feature, called Automatic 
Asynconorous functions. which has one stipulation. all contents are 
thread safe by default. it allows you to build a totally multi-core 
centric program without having to spawn threads yourself.<br><br>what 
does it mean in layman terms? Any function you call, user wrote or 
system thread is executed in a new thread and the call returns 
imediately before it's even executed. BUT the object/value it returns IS
 returned in a container, that has a 'IsReady' property<br><br>so, a real world example for say a streaming gtaIII world would be,<br><br>;def<br><br>static async Texture(string path);<br><br>the async keyword. even on a constructor.<br><br>Texture myTex = new Texture("Player.jpg")<br><br>returns imediately and returns a valid texture object but it is not ready until you call<br><br>myTex.IsReady<br><br>and it returns true, then you can use it's contents.<br><br>Same goes for any datatype even ints and strings.<br><br><br>So
 with just a bid of a adapating your programs will be fully future 
proof, and remember all this is done on REAL hardware threads, not 
simulated or scripted threads. <br><br>You will also be able to give dynamic prorities to async functions<br><br>static async Texture(string path) &gt; Slow<br><br><br>would result in a low prority.<br><br>static async Texture(string path) &gt; Fastest<br><br>would be the higest prority. allow you to very easily ditact cpuload to the most crucial methods.<br><br><br>I'm looking forward to writing the debugger that has to handle a 100 active threads intelligently... wait, maybe i'm not. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Visual Monkey IDE - IDE and integrated step debugger</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-12-06)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> I've been working on the ide for the past couple of days, and it is shaping up very nicely.<br><br>The syntax highlighting works perfectly, both on whole files, and in real time as you code.<br><br>i.e the second you type class it will turn red.(Colors will be optional)<br><br>Using the latest .Net controls such as toolstrip containers etc the gui is fully customizable.<br><br>Their is a console output window in the view tab at the bottom.<br><br>Plugins

 will post an alpha of codemonkey ide/compiler shortly. 2 people already
 have the first beta, and despite a few bugs which were quckly squished 
no major problems were found.<br>So it's just a case of adding a few more features, polishing the ide and finally the debugger.<br><br>The
 debugger will feature all the standard controls, and there will be a C#
 like locals window with all local variables etc with their values so 
you can browse.<br><br>The ide and debugger are being modeled after 
Visual C#'s ide, not maxide, so don't expect a familar debugger. expect a
 much better one.(Don't get me wrong, MaxIde and Debugger were 
acceptable for a new product but two years later and not a single

 lofty goal...But a realistic one. Given the current state of the

 is a simple app, note that print and addinteger methods are added in 
code and wrote in pure C#. it uses delegates to hook functions in.<br><br><pre class="code">class Program 
{
	static int a = 25*4,b,c
	static int Main(int args)
	{

		System.Print(a)

		System.Print(System.AddIntegers(5,5)+a)

</pre><br><br>Notice it is a fully OOP language. The above sample works 
perfecty, and is not an hack. The compiler uses a predictive recursive 
decent parser I wrote myself, that has very strong error checking. Not 
only will it pick up practically any error possible, it would highlight 
the token that caused the error, and it will also SPEAK using xps sound 
lib a verbal star trek esque warning.<br><br>Where does max come in? Why max will be one of the many front ends for the runtime system of course.<br><br>C# was perfect for the compiler it's self, but for actually running the code Bmax will be used for the standalone version.<br><br>There
 will(And only is at the moment) be a full C# run time engine too, which
 allows you to use codemonkey as the most advance script system for C# 
today.(Not including C# it's self of course. But that's not a true 
script system.)<br><br>How it works is,<br><br>1. Parse Into tokens.<br>2. Parse into RDP Tree - (90% of the error checking is done here)<br>3. Further parse rdp tree (Third pass) to produce and ensure variable/class names are valid etc etc<br>4. Create virtual machine.<br>5.run program.<br><br><br>for example, here's the little C# app to run the above script, including the two custom functions.<br><br><pre class="code">  public partial class Form1 : Form
