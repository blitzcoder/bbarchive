 I'm preparing and testing a very big BLIde service pack, that will be 
available to all BLIde Plus users at the end of January. This will be 
the first major BLIde update since 2007. That's why I've considered this
 update a 'service pack'.<br><br>This first service pack will update 
several areas of the BLIde interface, will improve accessibility, will 
fix completely all the CSC errors that are seen randomly on some 
computers after a regular update, and will also benefit of some of the 
new developments we have done for the new Jungle Ide engine.<br><br>This
 service pack will also make BLIde use several threads to separate 
lexical and syntactical parsing on several supported languages such as 
C#, ANSI C, BLIde SDK, etc. Obviously this service pack will also 
include all the accumulated updates and fixes. Additionally, the 
updating system will be completely renew to a faster, smaller and more 
reliable system we've been developing using Inno Setup.<br><br>More details to come very soon. A release candidate version could be released in some days time.<br><br>Stay tuned!<br><br>Original post if you want to contribute: <a href="http://www.blide.org/?p=571" target="_blank">http://www.blide.org/?p=571</a> <br><br> ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯<br>Manel Ibáñez    ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/forum/" target="_blank">BLIde comunity</a> ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/" target="_blank">BLIde official Web Site</a> ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/BLIde_manual.pdf" target="_blank">BLIde manual in PDF</a> If you're using BLIde as your regular IDE for BlitzMax, please consider  <a href="http://www.blide.org/?page_id=302" target="_blank">getting the BLIde Plus! version</a> to support development. <a href="http://www.blide.org/?cat=5" target="_blank">Visit my BLIde development Blog!</a>  and get the Open Source <a href="http://sound3d.googlecode.com/" target="_blank">Sound3D module</a> for minib3d<br> <br>Dual 2 Core 2.8 (Windows 7) with ATI Mobility Radeon 4650 on a nice new Vaio :D </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>More windows dependency</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-06-14)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 While I'm trying to keep every improvement and new feature on BLIde as 
platform independent as possible (I would love to see BLIde running on 
mono in the future), I've added a new P/Invoke call to the 
PathRelativePathTo windows API, to improve some of the internal BLIde 
file handling on managed solutions.<br>This new changes will improve the
 way some files are referenced inside solutions (specially imported 
library nodes). From next version, file referencing will use relative 
paths when possible. Also, main nodes will be kept in a relative path to
 the main bls, or BlideUS main file. Older ".BLIde" files will also 
benefit from this.<br><br>This is very big step forward in making BLIde much more portable and team freindly.<br><br>----<br>EDIT:<br>Additionally
 I've been working today on some improvements on the BLIde-BlitzMax 
debuger. I've changed the way the 'Kill' signal is sent to the running 
process when the debug session is canceled.<br><br>In curent BLIde 
version, if the debug request is ignored after 30 seconds, BLIde 
brute-force kills the running application. This is done to ensure any 
full-screen graphic context does not leave the computer in a 'blocked' 
status when a unhandled exception or a debugstop is thrown.<br><br>In 
next version, BLIde will leave the application open, and will add a "T" 
(stacktrace) and a "Q" (Quit) signal to the debug input, so the 
application will report a call stack and primary debug information, and 
then will naturally die (releasing also the graphic context, if any). <br><br>Why
 this change? This will help people writing server-like applications, as
 usually those applications are not monitorized all the time, and 
brute-force closing them without reporting any more information was 
making things a bit rude to work with.<br><br>EDIT2: I've been working 
more on the Debuger, and I've solved some sync. issues with the BlitzMax
 debuger. It seems the BlitzMax debuger sometimes and randomly ignores 
some objectdumb requests, and that was confusing BLIde. It's been 
solved, so BLIde won't lose sync if that happens.<br>Also, I've been 
writing a word hilighting on the BLIde rendering engine. It's not 
perfect, but quite usable. It works very well when used with the BLIde 
default color schema, but may fail (still) on customized schemas. Hope 
to have all this sorted out for this release.<br>Lot's of things going 
on on BLIde internals. Also, next executable has been a bit more 
optiomized and it is smaller in size and a bit faster on the JIT (so 
launches a bit faster). <br><br> ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯<br>Manel Ibáñez    ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/forum/" target="_blank">BLIde comunity</a> ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/" target="_blank">BLIde official Web Site</a> ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/BLIde_manual.pdf" target="_blank">BLIde manual in PDF</a> If you're using BLIde as your regular IDE for BlitzMax, please consider  <a href="http://www.blide.org/?page_id=302" target="_blank">getting the BLIde Plus! version</a> to support development. <a href="http://www.blide.org/?cat=5" target="_blank">Visit my BLIde development Blog!</a>  and get the Open Source <a href="http://sound3d.googlecode.com/" target="_blank">Sound3D module</a> for minib3d<br> <br>Dual 2 Core 2.8 (Windows 7) with ATI Mobility Radeon 4650 on a nice new Vaio :D </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>RC almost ready!</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-04-07)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">

 I've nearly finished the new project format and it'll be based on XML 
schemas. I've done it this way in order for engine users be able to 
provide project templates with their engines. This will be terribly 
usefull for people using great 3D engines like Flow3D or Leadwers, as 
it'll make it easy to start a new project with all DLLs and dependent 
files in place, from the begining of the unmanaged solution. Obviously 
this will come on a secondary step. Now I've got a preliminar solution 
explorer, where you can see files and folders, and a new unmanaged 
solution wizard.<br>this new unmnanaged solution system is based on the 
project management of some C and C++ ides, instead of being based on 
Visual Basic .net IDE, so it will give users A LOT of flexibility, but 
BLIde will not perform any automatic dependencies management, so 
changing a name or location of a file, will force the coder to update 
all the references to this file 'by hand'. This introduces a easier way 
to deal with imports and more freedom at the cost of less organization 
control by BLIde.<br>The point is that BLIde plus users (and later blide free users) will have the opportunity to choose.<br><br>Additionally,
 this new unmanaged solution wizard will conform the Aereo wizard 
specification. Obviously, this wizard will have the appropiate fallbacks
 to show properly on XP or non-aereo vista machines.<br><br>More info to
 come soon. Me and the BLIde Beta team are still planing some areas of

 come with a new unmanaged project management system. Not too much to

 Yes, the first release of the SDK was a bit unorganized, so I'm 
organizing all the elements. Now Plugins will be delivered inside 
folders with the dll version and any additional file used by the plugin 
will be stored there! So to uninstall a plugin, it will be as easy as 
deleting the appropiate folder. I'm also thinking on some ways to make 
blide plugins comunicate with each other, so users can create plugins 
that can then be used by other plugins (like libraries or modules).<br><br>Additionally,
 I've fixed some small issues that have been reported (thanks to

 I'm working with the current BLIde Plus beta version, while adding a 
new feature. This new feature is the native compilation of plain win32 
dlls directly from the IDE, using a very simple syntax, in a way anybody
 can easilly create DLLs that can then be used on other languages (C, 
C++, VisualBasic .net, C#, Delphi) or in BlitzMax itself. Also, I can 
not say much about this yet, but I'm making some changes to let BLIde 
take advantage of something new...<br>This new features will be 
exclusive to BLIde Plus version. BLIde Free Edition will never support 
the creation of DLLs. Also, there's not BLIde Free Edition beta version

 That's been a long time since I don't make a major update of the 
internal BLIde parser. I've seen lots of areas where some improvements 
and optimizations could be done, so I've started a major internal update
 of the BLIde core engine. This will be the 10th engine BLIde internally
 uses (since the first QW parser on 2005?) I've updated BLIde to use the
 compona syntax editor, wich was great but incompatible with GDI+ on 
.net 2.0, then I switched BLIde to the Puzzle syntax editor control, 
wich was derived from the compona one, but it had LOTS of GD issues when
 used for some hours so... I changed it to the Actipro SyntaxEditor 
control... Worst move I've ever done, it is a resource eater and damn 
slow.<br>finally, I've decided to create my own parser based on the 
original QW engine and that was the key... current BlitzMax parser 
performs complex multi-thread operations to keep everything updated 'on 
the fly'.<br><br>The problem with the current engine is that it is based
 on a double-layer of software (BLIde talks to the parser driver, then 
the parser driver talks to the text renderer). that was designed this 
way to make any new parser engine easy to integrate on BLIde, leaving 
BLIde in a non so engine-dependant state, but since BLIde now uses its 
custom text parser, this has no sense, so time for a major rewrite has 
come, and I'm sure this change will speed up BLIde and make BLIde a 
little bit more memory friendly.<br><br>I will also add a tab to the 
intelliprompt pop-up to diferenciate the common methods and functions 
from the complete list of items (common / all). Visual Basic .net users 
will understand what I'm talking about.this will make things easy when 
dealing with the whole BlitzMax framework!<br><br>hope to have it ready soon... <br><br> ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯<br>Manel Ibáñez    ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/forum/" target="_blank">BLIde comunity</a> ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/" target="_blank">BLIde official Web Site</a> ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/BLIde_manual.pdf" target="_blank">BLIde manual in PDF</a> If you're using BLIde as your regular IDE for BlitzMax, please consider  <a href="http://www.blide.org/?page_id=302" target="_blank">getting the BLIde Plus! version</a> to support development. <a href="http://www.blide.org/?cat=5" target="_blank">Visit my BLIde development Blog!</a>  and get the Open Source <a href="http://sound3d.googlecode.com/" target="_blank">Sound3D module</a> for minib3d<br> <br>Dual 2 Core 2.8 (Windows 7) with ATI Mobility Radeon 4650 on a nice new Vaio :D </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Next BLIde Version...</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2008-08-03)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 I'm working on the next BLIde 0.9.58-A Free Edition of BLIde, and 
starting the alpha-testing for BLIde 0.9.58-B Plus version. This new 
Plus version has some minor changes, some of them focused on making 
BLIde much more SVN friendly regarding the solutions 'my' namespace 
changing its native GUID for intermediate classes. I'm also finishing an
 advanced parser for ANSI C and C++ with intellisense, folding and all 
this issues you would expect on a pro IDE, so mixing BlitzMax with C and
 C++ will be much more easy to do. Current C and C++ parser is based 
only on hilighting scheme.<br>I'm also thinking in a way to make imports
 on solutions platform speciffic to solve an issue with Grey Alliens 
Framework. This is being much more complicated that I first thought 
because this means I have to add a sort of property-per-import dialog

 Yes, the latest release candidate for BLIde 0.9.57 is out. This new 
version has a bunch of improvements on stability and speed, plus some 
additional interesting options.<br>While the current Release Candidate 1
 version is being tested (and surprisingly there have been no error 
reports in the last week). We're finishing a new approach to 
intellisense that will increase intellisense speed even more, and will 
make some special fixes on scope-matching locals. This new approach is a
 really big improvement on BLIde internal engine, as it can handle now 
near 200,000 keywords with full complex inheritance relations at real 
time on a simple pentium IV computer without any noticeable performance 
cost. Long life to wxWidgets, irrLirch and all those enormous modules 
that are being extremelly helpfull to optimize BLIde performance.<br><br>Also,
 there have been some improvements on internal BLIde GDI+ handling to 
ensure nothing is disposed too early on quad core computers, and nothing
 is disposed too late on core-solo computers. The multiple cores 
technology has introduced a bunch of differences on the program flow 
between architectures when working with multithreading and this is being
 the most unfriendly part to handle, but everything seems to be working 
well in all kind of processors. BLIde now works nativelly on 64 bits,

 BLIde version will include a long-time demanded feature that is full 
session serialization of open documents. This is being a little bit of a
 headache as I have to add a xml-guid based serialization algorithm to 
the BLIde projects and solutions as the default GUI engine of BLIde 
doesn't provide a good and reliable method to handle windows being 
disposed as a result of a complete layout serialization. That has 
introduced some stability issues that were present on the latest BETA 
build (0.9.54 C). After some work in the last days all this stability 
issues on the current BETA version have been solved, so the official 
production release is almost here.<br><br>Also there are some 
improvements in the advanced module builder, and a mechanism to update 
the BLIde modules cache without having to restart BLIde, wich is great 
and works surprisingly fast. <br><br>I've also corrected some existing 
compatibility issues with 3th party modules, specially with a very 
impressivle 3d module that is currently on development, and with the 
wxwidgets port made by Brucey. BLIde was very strict about folder 
structures on modules and that was causing some potential compatibility 
issues with 3rth party modules. All this issues have been detected and 
addressed.<br><br>I'm more than happy to see that BLIde can handle all 
the official modules with intellisense and hilighting, and the HUGHE 
wxwidgets library, and a collection of 3th party modules without any 
performance cost. My current BLIde installation is holding about 50,000 
keywords with complex inheritance, with their respective relationships 
on a core-solo machine at realtime (and people still says C# is 
slow...??)<br><br>I've also managed to optimize even more the run-time 
intellisense. This latest improvement is specially noticeable on single 
core processors, but it improves performance also on dual and quad core 
machines.<br><br>finaly, I've added a tool to disable user chosen 
modules from the intellisense engine. This is specillaly useful when 
(like me) you have several 3D engines installed that share a very 
similar instruction-set and you want to avoid getting intellisense based
 on the 3 engines at the same time!<br><br>That has been a very productive week and the result is an even more robust BLIde build with improved performance.<br><br>All this work wouldn't have been possible without the help of the beta testers that are providing feedback. <br><br> ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯<br>Manel Ibáñez    ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/forum/" target="_blank">BLIde comunity</a> ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/" target="_blank">BLIde official Web Site</a> ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/BLIde_manual.pdf" target="_blank">BLIde manual in PDF</a> If you're using BLIde as your regular IDE for BlitzMax, please consider  <a href="http://www.blide.org/?page_id=302" target="_blank">getting the BLIde Plus! version</a> to support development. <a href="http://www.blide.org/?cat=5" target="_blank">Visit my BLIde development Blog!</a>  and get the Open Source <a href="http://sound3d.googlecode.com/" target="_blank">Sound3D module</a> for minib3d<br> <br>Dual 2 Core 2.8 (Windows 7) with ATI Mobility Radeon 4650 on a nice new Vaio :D </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>New beta to come this week</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2008-06-08)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Yes, I've collected some of the issues found by BLIde users in the 
current beta 0.9.54-a and a new build will be ready for all Blide Plus 
testers, and BLIde Free Edition testers. None of the found bugs were 
replicable in the current stable release, and thats really great news :D<br><br>The
 main change of the next Beta version will be the definitive inclussion 
of the new session serialization algorithm with some compatibility 
issues completely fixed. The new sesion serialization algorithm will 
allow users to store all the documents possition when a project or 
solution is saved, restoring any existing tab group on the previouis 
session. That's something that has been demanded for ages now, and I'm 
glad it'll see the light very very soon.<br><br>I'm also trying to make 
the general interface clearer, less bloated and lighter. There are some 
ideas in this area wich I hope will make BLIde new users fell less 
'scared' by the total amount of tools and options BLIde provides. BLIde 
is growing on functinonality, but it has to grow also in ease of use. 
I'm currently working on this direction.<br><br>Also, I would like to 
integrate the wonderful BriskVM with BLIde. This is not a trivial task, 
I'm improving the BLIde SDK and, by now, I've added the possibility to 
programatically generate autolist on any language that can be shown 
while the BLIde user codes. That's a great improvement (it has not been 
easy...) but it is just the 10% of what is still remaining to be done.<br><br>Next version also will load faster and user less memory. Some improvements on this area.<br><br>Well,
 to finish this week worklog, I'm improving the text renderer and parser
 to be even faster (I'm now getting very close to the scintilla speed, 
even using managed code!!!). Very interesting improvements on this area 
are about to come very soon (with some additional improvements to the 
general editor experience). I'm more than glad to have moved away from a
 third party control I was using becouse it was way too slow and CPU 
demanding.<br><br>There's still a lot of work to do on the debugger 
area. Not sure when it'll be done, as it may requiere a major BLIde 
update, and this is something I'll better do when the current BETA 
raises the production status. <br><br> ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯<br>Manel Ibáñez    ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/forum/" target="_blank">BLIde comunity</a> ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/" target="_blank">BLIde official Web Site</a> ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/BLIde_manual.pdf" target="_blank">BLIde manual in PDF</a> If you're using BLIde as your regular IDE for BlitzMax, please consider  <a href="http://www.blide.org/?page_id=302" target="_blank">getting the BLIde Plus! version</a> to support development. <a href="http://www.blide.org/?cat=5" target="_blank">Visit my BLIde development Blog!</a>  and get the Open Source <a href="http://sound3d.googlecode.com/" target="_blank">Sound3D module</a> for minib3d<br> <br>Dual 2 Core 2.8 (Windows 7) with ATI Mobility Radeon 4650 on a nice new Vaio :D </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Next BLIde version will be 0.9.54-A</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2008-06-01)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Yes, I'm finishing a new BLIde update. This time the major changes are:<br><br><b>Cleaner code</b><br>I've
 cleaned a lot the internal BLIde code. Five years of development had 
converted some areas of the BLIde code a little nightmare to mantain, so
 I've decided to clean it up as much as possible. Surprisingly, while 
surfing trough all the code, I've managed to optimize some areas, so 
BLIde is now a lot faster in some areas.<br><br><b>Module cache configuration</b><br>I've
 also added a tool to 'exclude' some modules from the internal BLIde 
database. The object of this new tool is not to make BLIde faster, as 
BLIde is not suffering from slowdowns caused for the complexity of the 
framework. The intention of this is to let users disable intellisense 
for the modules they doesn't regulary use. I've got 3 3D modules 
installed and some of them share some base functionality and I was 
having intellisense from the 3 engines at the same time! A little bit 
confusing!<br><br><b>BLIde SDK generates native .net DLL files</b><br>The
 SDK can now generate native compiled .net DLLs to add functionality to 
BLIde. I'm more than happy with this part and that has improved BLIde 
loading time, and making the plugins source code more secure.<br><br><b>New SDK components and functionality</b><br>I've
 added a new component to the BLIde SDK that lets the SDK coder create 
tabbed documents in the BLÏde layout, as any other existing BLIde tool, 
and this is done in a complete transparent way for the Plugin users. 
I've also added a way to provide some basic intellisense to non bmx or 
sdk files, using the SDK. the final goal is that BLIde will be able to 
be configured to act as an IDE for virtually any language. Next step 
will be to add function parameter hint through the SDK and folding, and 
then... the parsers... a lot of pending work to do!!!...<br><br><b>Better intellisense</b><br>Also, I've made some improvements to the intellisense system. It is now a little bit faster and it is even more precise.<br><br><b>Improved localisation</b><br>Additionaly,
 I've changed the Ctrl+Enter functionality to Alt+Enter, as the 
Ctrl+Space is being used by chinese users to toggle the multilingual 
imput text mode (wich BLIde now supports nativelly.<br><br><b>New customer tool</b><br>I've
 also added a new little information tool in the Help panel that informs
 about the version number of any BLIde component installed. This tool is
 there just as a customer's support helper, so I can know what assemblys
 are being used with BLIde when a BLIde customer reports a bug.<br><br><b>BLIde Plus to be priorized over Free Edition</b><br>Additionaly,
 as mantaining two versions of BLIde up to date is starting to be a bit 
of a nightmare, I've decided that the BLIde Free Edition updates will 
come in a slower ratio than the BLIde Plus updates, so BLIde Free 
Edition users will get updates once every 3 or 4 months, unless a 
important stability needs to be patched urgently. This doesn't mean that
 I've dropped the development of BLIde Free Edition, it is just not 
priority 1 at the moment, being the priority 1 the BLIde Plus Edition.<br><br><b>New BLIde Website</b><br>This
 has been a very productive week. I've finished the new BLIde website, 
wich is a smaller website, based on php instead of static html, so it 
will be easier to mantain and expand. <br><br> ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯<br>Manel Ibáñez    ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/forum/" target="_blank">BLIde comunity</a> ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/" target="_blank">BLIde official Web Site</a> ||| <a href="http://www.blide.org/BLIde_manual.pdf" target="_blank">BLIde manual in PDF</a> If you're using BLIde as your regular IDE for BlitzMax, please consider  <a href="http://www.blide.org/?page_id=302" target="_blank">getting the BLIde Plus! version</a> to support development. <a href="http://www.blide.org/?cat=5" target="_blank">Visit my BLIde development Blog!</a>  and get the Open Source <a href="http://sound3d.googlecode.com/" target="_blank">Sound3D module</a> for minib3d<br> <br>Dual 2 Core 2.8 (Windows 7) with ATI Mobility Radeon 4650 on a nice new Vaio :D </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
