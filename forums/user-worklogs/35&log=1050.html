 I have been waiting for Ben and Rob to resolve the hierarchy issues in 
our animations...not an easy task, considering that the Blitz 3DS 
loaders don't work properly when you throw character hierarchies at 
them.<br><br>In the meantime, I spent a few hours on the physics, and 
was pretty amazed at all I found lacking.  I finally fixed the system up
 so that it now truly performs real game physics.  Velocities, air 
resistance, friction, and normal forces are all accounted for.  I never 
thought of physics as a real headlining feature, but now that I know the
 amount of work it takes to get all the aspects of it working together, I
 think the physics routines of singularity make it very appealing to 
potential licensees.<br><br>The current plan is to work out this 
animation system entirely, and then release a demo with the animation, 
and a character walking around a small level with a weapon.  After that,
 network code will be added back in, and at that point licensing for the
 engine will be available.  We have had several groups express interest 
in working with the engine, including a reputable software company who 
has had a major title out in the last year.  I hope that this engine is 
able to create a community of both licensed developers and enthusiasts 
making free mods of the engine.<br> <br><br> IF SOMEBODY IS ASKING FOR

 Well, my second FPS game, titled "s | n g u l a r i t y", has gotten a 
major shot in the arm with some help from my old Quake friends at 
polycount.  I posted an animation demo there and within 24 hours had 
gotten 50 emails from artists wanting a piece of the action.  With the 
dynamic skeletal animations system nearly complete, and Blitz3D's new 
bsp support on the way, expect a demo out within a week.<br><br>The 
engine now boasts many powerful features, and keeps getting better every
 day.  It won't be long before we can kick Unreal II's ass.  Numerous 
individuals, and a few software companies, have expressed interest in 
licensing the engine and/or dynamic skeletal animation system.  
Meanwhile, my coding is getting better and better, and I can now 
complete complex operations that used to take me days in a few minutes.<br><br>Enough
 talk, just wait about a week to see complete dynamic character 
animation and some killer visuals in a playable, solid engine.<br> <br><br>
