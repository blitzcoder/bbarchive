 Wow, almost 4 months no entry. Sounds like the fate of most worklogs. 
;-) Well, I was searching for a job, which was more important than 
getting my game finished - at least until I earn millions with my future
 games...<br><br>So, any news about the game? Yeah, of course. I 
finished a first version of a level editor. At the moment I'm porting 
all levels from C64 to Windows. It's easy, because the original SHIFT 
contained a level editor, too.<br><br>During this I remembered some very
 annoying game features, which I decided to re- or probably improve. Eg.
 the original game contained invisible walls you would only encounter, 
if you run against them. The hidden bonus levels were full of these 
walls and as you just had a limit amount of allowed hits in bonus 
stages, there was absolutly NO chance to finish them (until you drew the
 found walls to a sheet of paper). That never was fun, so I replaced 
them with regular walls. Doesn't make the game easier though. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>"If you build it, they'll come!"</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-11-17)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Almost 20 years ago there was a game called "SHIFT" on a german C64 
diskmag called "Magic Disk 64". I really enjoyed this game... no, even 
more: Since over 15 years I'm haunted by the idea to do a remake of it.<br><br>So
 what's this game about? Basically it's a Sokoban clone, but with some 
extras like oneways, locked doors, exploding things, etc. It's really 
fun to play. And this is my worklog about the progress.<br><br>During the last two days I wrote the skeleton of the game: important vars, game states, basic menu and ingame functionality.<br><br>Before I continue with the game logic, I'll have to write a level editor. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
