 After hours of confangled GUI mapping, the Main Menu is done. For now. 
Not all the later-available features are enabled (and have promptly been
 "greyed-out"). Devil has created a lot of good libraries, best of all 
free! So I will be supporting a few of them with due credit. A few 
being: GUI, Shadows, Particles. Physics will be tokamak. And the 
networking will be my own creation (which you can find in the Code 
Archives). As I've already mentioned I will use my own active scripting 
library to handle map making.<br><br>Tomorrow I will begin the 3D work. I
 will start with the World Editor, as so I can crank out some test maps 
as well as get meshes, scripting, particles, game objects, ect... 
working! This will be the longest part, but after this I just need to 
transfer the display and loading code over and add some Game Update 
functions to actually start playing. An Offline Practice portion will be
 offered, but don't expect AI to be great. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Simple Update</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2007-08-05)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Imperial GUI was scrapped, do to the fact that it was cluttered and slow.

 Well It's me again. You haven't seen much of me around I'm sure. I'm 
not dead though! In fact my B3D is getting better! This game isn't even 
in its 3D stage yet but when it will, watch out. Lol. It already 
features my newly created from scratch...<br><br>- PsychoScript: 
Cross-project support. Enables each game/app to support its own c++ 
style classes and its own private and public functions. Still in its 
earlier stages supports LUA style functions and variable declarations 
with advanced math support. Perfect for map making.<br>- Imperial GUI: 
New skinable cross-project GUI system to corrilate with the scripting 
engine and in-game menus. Features clean frame-built skins. Features 
non-chromatic custom color mode for scripted maps.<br>- PsychoOnline: 
Advanced TCP/LAN library for server/client connectivity. Plays a lead 
role in this game. Allows for servers to send scripts to clients also. 
Built in auto-downloader for update and mods for servers.<br><br>So the 
premises of this game is easy! Its MMO, with a bit of RTS/FPS in it. 
Players join online worlds(servers) and join countries in these worlds. 
The players then band together and try to destroy other countries to 
take them over. Instead of the older simple capture the flag style or 
kind of the hill, teams can actually take over individual "zones"  by 
destroy key defence structures and systems. By owning town by town, base
 by base, and enemies territory can quickly deplete. Once signed up for a
 country the players stats and work are kept in action on that server 
even after they leave, so they may return and battle more with their 
fellow brothers (players can be discharged from service). Who's country 
will prevail? With online services in the future "country" teams will be
 published and saved for cross-server action allowing private clans to 
be developed. Imperialism IS the name of the game. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
