 *** 11:16 PM - So now that the project is starting to grow I went 
searching for more ideas and technical documentation to help us create 
the ultimate server and stumbled across <a href="http://gafferongames.com/networking-for-game-programmers/" target="_blank">this interesting set of articles</a> on game networking - what a wealth of ideas!<br><br>***
 Something I am toying with is the idea of creating a VM inside the 
server and client and running lua scripts with the intention of sending 
them over the network to become part of the game - I am even toying with
 the idea of creating a new script language that can be fed into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop" target="_blank">REPL</a>
 locally for quick tests and sent to the server and run through an 
interpreter to execute functions. I would want the scripting language to
 be customisable so that an alias could be used to mask commands that 
way it could be customised to suit the style of game ie. RPG or FPS or 
whatever - I don't know I have these crazy thoughts!<br><br>** Confirmed
 Skype meet with Guy Fawkes - the inspiration and driving force behind 
the G1 Server - may as well say the team leader :)<br><br>** Discussed 
with Lord of Goo a way to add custom slash commands using XML and JSON 
parsing and the potential for a command such as CustomSlashCommand() and
 even CustomPacket().<br><br>** Discussed various networking elements 
with Lord of Goo including IPv6 - and extended the UDP Protocol more. 
Also worked on bits versus bytes in the protocol to start the 
compression process.<br><br>** I was introduced to the Lord of the Rings slash commands today - I am inspired!<br><br>** Confirmed with D-Man whether he would be interested in a network game dev team - YES!!!<br><br>** Discussed using G1 to create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft" target="_blank">World of Warcraft</a> clone with all the networking features.<br><br>**
 Well its Tuesday here - 12:36 AM - I have been at it for the last few 
hours and need a few more hours to finish what I started but 
unfortunately I can probably only afford another hour at the most - so 
lets see what happens! <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Update - Monday, 7 March 2016</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">2016-03-07</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> ** I also have a command called DisConnIGS()<br><br>** I plan to add the command ModeratorCommand() in the next day or two.<br><br>** I plan to add the command SlashCommand() in the next day or two.<br><br>* I just noticed a spelling error in my comments :)<br><br><img src="23752&amp;log=1917_files/NewCommandSet-7-03-2016.html"><br><br>PFI	- Packet Format ID @ Server<br><br>PFIC	- Packet Format ID @ Client<br><br>Packet Format ID - PFI<br><br>0	=	Position/Orientation<br>1	=	Public Message<br>2	=	Private Message<br>3	=	Recieved<br>4	=	Send Again<br>5	=	Blank for now!<br>6	=	Blank for now!<br>7	=	Blank for now!<br>8	=	Blank for now!<br>9	=	Blank for now!<br><br>Packet Formats - PF<br><br>PF,Blah,Blah,Etc.<br><br>0,ID,X,Y,Z,P,Y,R	=	Position/Orientation Packet - 25 Bytes<br><br>1,ID,Null,Message	=	Public Message - Lets try 514 Bytes<br><br>2,ID,Recipient,Message	=	Private Message - Lets try 562 Bytes<br><br>; -------------------------------------------------------------------<br>; These are special - they could be tied into the clients system.<br><br>3,ID,PKT#		=	This could be kept pretty small<br><br>4,ID,PKT#		=	This could be kept pretty small<br><br>So upon return you would have something like:<br><br>PFIC,Blah,Blah,Etc<br><br>The packet system between server and client is slightly different hence the last example. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Big Code Weekend Update - Sunday, 6 March 2016</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">2016-03-05</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> **** Well after one very frustrating weekend lets hope the next big code weekend is more productive - it happens . . .<br><br>*
 9:38 PM - I spent most of the day playing with Azure - I want to run a 
public Beta test with it for Infinitude Game Server. It is a Server 2012
 install but I am only going to use it as a client to access the server 
at my location since it appears to be behind NAT.<br><br>* Started researching Nat Punch-through - UDP hole punching techniques.<br><br>***
 So in keeping with simplicity - I have Blitz3D commands setup like 
this: ConnectIGS() for connecting to server. InputTest(str$) for test 
messages; disabled by default.<br>* So for now I am hoping for:<br>** ConnectIGS() - Connects to game server<br>** UpdateFIGS() - Updates from game server<br>** UpdateTIGS() - Updates to game server<br>** DisConnIGS() - Disconnect from game server<br>*
 I hope this is easy enough to follow; these are the Blitz3D commands 
for connecting, receive updates, send updates, disconnecting.<br><br>** 11:34 AM - Time to get back into it - More message routing.<br><br>** 3:15 AM Now lets try routing a message or two!<br><br>**
 3:10 AM Finally - after much frustration I have the basis of the 
message router in place - coded tested and working - this has taken 2 
hours more than it should have.<br><br>:) <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Big Code Weekend Update - Saturday, 5 March 2016</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">2016-03-04</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> <img src="23752&amp;log=1917_files/Week_1_Thanks.html"><br><br>12:36 PM - Waking up has been tough today - so I am getting a late start!<br><br>1:59

 to test the private message routing system and the players
