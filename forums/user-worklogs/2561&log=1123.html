This is my first worklog for my new game Maz &amp; Joe. <br><br>The
 idea behind the game was to make an engine for future projects. As it 
stands, instead of making something boring, I thought I’d make a game 
for my girlfriend and her sister. They basically begged me to make a 
game about them so I thought I would.<br><br>I’ve been making another 2D
 platformer busily in the background but I’ve had a coder’s block in 
that department. I’m not exactly a competent coder, as I’m sure the 
Blitz Basic (http://blitzbasic.com) forum all well know, but I do try 
hard. The thing that stuck me on my previous game was the whole map 
collision thing. Jumping on to platforms and staying there, hitting into
 platforms and coming off them again etc. This was tough, for me anyway,
 and so I thought that I would get some help. Alas, the Blitz Coder 
(http://blitzcoder.com) site came to the rescue with Krylar’s tutorial 
on basic map loading and scrolling. I followed this through and now I’ve
 got the jest of the whole collision thing. Sorted.<br><br>Anyway, the 
idea of the game is Jim (me) is taking Maz (my girlfriend) and Joe (her 
sister) to work but the car runs out of petrol. So it’s a race against 
time for the girls to get to their work before the their shift starts. 
The place contains a few famous places, if anyone is familiar with 
Abingdon and Didcot in Oxfordshire, UK. Such shops as Alldays and 
Budgens. Also places like MacDonalds and Travel Inns. This game is 
basically based on our lives, where we smoke fags a lot, eat MacDonalds a
 lot and go to Alldays or Budgens (to most probably get our fags). What a
 life we live, and one that should be put in a game me thinks!<br><br>The
 game itself has a lot of elements like old skool platformers have, but 
this is what I wanted to aim for. Elements taken from the best games in 
history such as Mario and Sonic, to make a simple enjoyable platform 
game engine that could be used time and time again.<br><br>Now this game
 ain’t completely cutesy though. And it is probably advised for people 
15+ to play it. This is because it does have fags and smoking in it, 
does have sex in it and swearing. So it’s pretty much an exact insight 
into my life!<br><br>Currently the moves on offer to each player are:<br>   ·Stand<br>   ·Run<br>   ·Jump<br>   ·Smoke<br>   ·Eat<br>   ·Sex<br><br>I've
 still got to get the animations sorted and the level tiles sorted. But 
as the game stands at the minute, you can control Maz around a simple 
level (with proper collision that works!) and collect fags. Even little 
points come out of the items when they are collected. Im so proud of 
myself!<br><br>Update soon...<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
