 The engine’s scene manager was already complete when I bought the 
iGlass library. It pulled the static and animated images from the 
database and set their positions and order. The engine is pretty simple,
 each image was managed in either an actor or prop class that handled 
mouse-over and click events and sent the events to the event manager. <br><br>After
 I integrated iGlass to get my popup stuff working I found that it was 
doing the same stuff in it’s RefreshGui function and I was getting weird
 anomalies like the cursor going under some images and incorrect order 
of overlapping images. <br><br>I had to decide to either commit to 
iGlass and wire it into the scene manager or go back to writing my own 
popup and listbox classes. After testing a few approaches I figured that
 it would take less time and coding to rewrite the scene manager but 
that pretty much cements the iGlass library into the engine instead of 
hanging off to the side as I had intended. <br><br>I finished that last night and now have to work through my fear of commitment. <br><br> Play as hard as you work </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>GUIs and such</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2007-01-06)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Getting the actor dialog to work in a popup window was turning into a bigger piece then I wanted to spend on it. <br><br>I
 decided it was time to turn to a GUI library. I tried MaxGUI but I 
didn’t read the forums well enough or I would have figured out before I 
bought it that it wasn’t the right tool for in-game display management. 
After looking at a few GUIs I settled on iGlass because it came with a 
lot of example code and documentation.<br><br>I thought that it was 
another wrong turn at first when I discovered that it didn’t support 
hiding the scrollbars in the listbox. I didn’t like the utilitarian look
 of the  scrollbars for presenting the user input choices in the 
conversation. It just didn't look game-like. <br><br>I bought the lib to
 save programming time and didn’t want to dig into the source code but I
 opened up the hood just to see how big a deal it would be. A few 
minutes later I was an iGlass fan. The code is very well organized and 
readable and I ended up extending the listbox class while I had it open –
 20 minutes max. Nice work Philippe <br><br>On to the inventory manager – hoo-rah <br><br> Play as hard as you work </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Actor Dialog</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2007-01-03)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 The actor dialog feature is complete. It is a question answer type of 
system that will run rules based on the user input. The currently the 
rules are:<br><br>Rule 1 - put item in inventory, fact = item number<br>Rule 2 - put entry in Journal, fact = dialogText number<br>Rule 3 - put location in Journal, fact = scene number<br>Rule 4 - update gameState, fact = gameState number<br><br>There will be more as I go along but these will do for now. <br><br> Play as hard as you work </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>happy new year</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-12-30)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 My favorite games are 2D adventure/puzzle games. I fell in love with 
the old Sierra games in the 80s and still play that style when I find 
them. <br><br>I had to come up with a way that one person working part 
time could actually finish a visually appealing and playable game. Some 
of the latest games in the genre like Syberia appear to use a mixture of
 2D backgrounds and 3D models and simulate the 2D view port with fixed 
camera angles. I experimented with that idea using the Torque engine but
 decided that creating the 3D models and animations was out of scope for
 one person.<br><br>I settled on Blitzmax for the game engine after doing some tests with other engines which included:<br>-Torque (both 3D and 2D)<br>-Flat Red Ball (FRB)<br>-Darkbasic Pro<br>-Game Studio A6<br><br>I
 went back and forth a few times and even had a basic working version of
 the game engine in FRB. The final call came from a test that I set up 
with several engines using the same backgrounds and sprites that I had 
cobbled together. Blitzmax displayed the best quality sprites with 
Torque Game Builder coming in a close second. I liked the particle 
engine in Torque but getting my game logic going seemed to just take 
forever so I switched to Blitzmax and it is really coming along. I 
really liked FRB because it is written in C# but it had the worst 
display of all of the tests - darn shame.<br><br>I am working on a bmax 
game engine that has a little workflow engine using Sqlite for the 
database. The basic “find stuff and take them to someone” games are just
 a form of workflow but licensing Staffware is out of my budget so I 
rolled my own. So far I have basic setup, navigation, and scene 
management done and actor dialog about at 80%. The player journal and 
inventory system are still on drawing board. When it is finished, the 
entire game will be driven from the database. <br><br>I went with Poser 
for the animations. It is easy to create animations and convert them to 
high quality sprites and there is an excellent community for buying 
artwork so I don’t have to do all of it myself. I am using 3DS Max for 
creating the background art but started using Vue d’Esprit for rendering
 because it gives better control over lighting and atmosphere.<br><br>I will have some screenshots in next few weeks and I am on track to have a playable demo by June 07. <br><br> Play as hard as you work </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
