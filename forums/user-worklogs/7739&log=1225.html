 sound has an accompanying dat file that contains the distance at which

make the sound louder or quieter. <br><br>Sounds are loaded into an 
type, that array is assigned to an array with an ID, for quick accessing
 rather than searching through a list of types for it.<br><br>When a 
sound is played, an emitter is created. If the X parameter is assigned, 
the sounds Pan is calculated. If X and Y are assigned, the distance the 
player is away from the sound is calculated, and pan is calculated for 
the sound.<br><br>This allows a nice "3d" effect of the sounds, creates a nice effect.<br><br>Emitters can be paused, resumed, etc all on command.<br><br>All done in 86 lines.<br> <br><br> ---<br>ATI X850 XT, 1GIG RAM, AMD Althon 3200+ (~2.0GHz)<br>BlitzMax, BlitzPlus </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Autoupdater</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2005-10-30)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 My game, Mundus, features a rather effective autoupdater. Whenever the 
game is ran (not in debug mode), it instantly closes and starts up the 
autoupdater. The autoupdater then downloads a list of files and 
calculates the checksums of the client files (if they exist). Compares 
the files, if the checksum doesnt match or the file doesnt even exist, 
it begins to download the file. Once all the files are downloaded, it 
closes it self and starts the client up.<br><br>Currently theres 47 files it downloads about 80-100 kb/s (for me), in total 3 MBs. It downloads it in around a minute.<br><br>The file host is a webserver hosted off of my computer right now. It will do for now.<br> <br><br> ---<br>ATI X850 XT, 1GIG RAM, AMD Althon 3200+ (~2.0GHz)<br>BlitzMax, BlitzPlus </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Remake</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2005-10-25)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> The remake is a big jump from the older versions Ive made (I think I got a few of them).<br><br>I will write about each specific part of the game as I get time to.<br><br>Right now heres a quick summary:<br>Mundus
 is a 2d, top down, shooter, but it may be considered an ORPG or Action 
RPG considering its mixed with MMORPG and action shooter. Accounts can 
be registered in the client. The world is made up of 64x64  grids, each 
being 640x480 pixels. That allows me to load the maps as needed, not all
 at once. Those are called grids.<br><br>When you create your account, 
you choose a "kingdom" to be in (3 kingdoms in total). Each kingdom are 
made up of territories. A territory is made up of many grids (20x15 
tiles chunk of the world). Main goal of the game is to conquer other 
kingdoms by capturing their territories. Currently, capturing takes 60 
seconds but that subject to change.<br><br>Thats a really rough description of the game.<br> <br><br> ---<br>ATI X850 XT, 1GIG RAM, AMD Althon 3200+ (~2.0GHz)<br>BlitzMax, BlitzPlus </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>New stuff</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2004-10-25)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> DOES ANYONE WANT TO HELP ME DESIGN THIS WORLD? PLEASE EMAIL AT seankarol@... !!!<br><br>Im
 thinking of adding another skill named Stealth. it would be when you 
use it, you go invisible to the other teams for a limited amount of time
 (level*1000 ms), thus making it a good ambush skill, especially in 
neutral territory (the blue gun is a assassin gun, that does lots of 
dmg, perfect for this)<br><br>I added leaders for the Red and Blue team (same as a king)<br><br>I
 added a skill! accuracy! everytime you shoot you gain 1 experience to 
that skill. the experience to level is 80*level. this affects your 
bullet accuracy (which right now is incorrect) by accuracy-level.<br><br>NPCs can walk around now, but mostly only guards do (so far)<br>NPCs have 3 different answers for every command now, one for each team (neutral, red and blue)<br>NPCs can die now!<br><br>I added laws to the neutral territories to stop people from just killing NPCs (that are useful, like gunsmiths)<br>One
 of the two laws is: if you shoot your gun and a NPC sees you do it, you
  are marked as dangerous. if a guard sees you marked as dangerous, you 
instantly lose 200 gold, you are sent to the starting place and you lose
 your gun and get a pistol in 2 minutes.<br>another law is: every swear 
you say, you get fined 5 gold pieces, it will stop people from swearing 
non-stop, but not the odd swear<br><br>I redid all the guns:<br>pistol<br>sub-machine gun<br>machine gun<br>rifle<br>assault rifle<br>sniper rifle<br>(if you got any other suggestions that follow that style please email me it :))<br><br>Fixed the blood bug (they actually show now!)<br><br>I also fixed many bugs<br> <br><br> ---<br>ATI X850 XT, 1GIG RAM, AMD Althon 3200+ (~2.0GHz)<br>BlitzMax, BlitzPlus </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>NPCs</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2004-10-21)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> I added the ability for some NPCs to heal you for 50 gold pieces.<br><br>NPC's

 to familarize yourself with my game a bit, One Man Army is a top down

 got the map editor, about 90% done, I cant work up the strength to 
continue on it and finish the few features that still exist.<br><br>So, ive been pushing my bonus map maker to make some bonus maps but he hasnt produced anything useable for the game.<br><br>I
 have animations for the player throwing a grenade that are overdue for,
 oh 12 days I think? That set the development back a bit.<br><br>I 
finished most of the AI, they're pretty good but some of it random that I
 cant even answer. They are very tough and have well no cheating
