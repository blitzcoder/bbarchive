It even worked first time, as well.<br><br>During
 the course of implementing it, I tweaked the system a little bit. When 
referring to an actor id or group id, I simplified thing substantially. 
Actor ids now start at 100. Anything below that is considered a group 
id. There's now no need to specify what type of id you are using, the 
value will speak for itself.<br><br>Other than that, it seems to work as
 advertised. I need to do a few more tests on the nesting, but I'm 
pretty happy with how it's turned out.<br><br>It needs more work to add 
in the various functions that the script can call, but that's basically 
grunt work. And, since it's not really needed at this stage, I'm going 
to move onto the final "big" part: the front-end. I want the player to 
be able to choose a mission, choose ships to bring, set a starting 
formation and click "go".<br><br>I'll take it in small steps.<br><br>And hopefully there'll be some screenshots for you next time! <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Scripting in Space!</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-11-14)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Been a bit quiet lately, because I've been thinking about how to script the levels.<br><br>I've eventually settled on an XML solution (oh, Glenn, what a surprise!). Seriously, there are good reasons.<br><br>I
 considered using LUA, but the only available Blitz implementation 
doesn't seem to be feature-complete. I'd like to learn LUA, but I think 
I'll wait until I can use it properly.<br><br>Since I'm already using 
XML, I decided to see what I could do with that. It's looking promising,
 and streets ahead of what I had on Drop Fighter.<br><br>Here's an example of the script code.<br><br><pre class="code">&lt;if tag="close_to_actor" args="id,2,id,1" fire_limit="1"&gt;
	&lt;event tag="kill" args="groupid,2"&gt;&lt;/event&gt;
&lt;/if&gt;
</pre><br>It's pretty simple, the &lt;if&gt; tag has some attributes 
that describe what kind of condition is being tested. In this case, it's
 checking if the actor with id 2 is within 100 units of the actor with 
id 1. If this is true, then the event is triggered.<br><br>The event will kill all the ships in group 2.<br><br>The
 "fire_limit" attribute in the &lt;if&gt; tag is a way of setting how 
many times a condition should "fire", in this case, just once is 
necessary.<br><br>The really fun part about all this is that I can have multiple events in each condition.<br><br>The
 really, really fun part is that I can have multiple nested &lt;if&gt; 
tags. So I can evaulate an &lt;if&gt; statement, and it it's true, and 
can carry out an event, and then evaluate a nested &lt;if&gt; statement.
 The second will only be considered if the first is true. You know all 
that, it's basic programming stuff, but it's really cool for me to be 
able to effectively have it interpreted like this, and seperate from the
 main executable.<br><br>I'm officially in the "boring" stage of this 
game now, where I actually need to add gameplay features that, in 
programming terms, aren't much of a big deal. I start these projects 
with certain lofty (for me) goals, and then as soon as I achieve them, I
 drag my feet on the "easy" stuff. The scripting was the last "big idea"
 I wanted to get in.<br><br>I now have to make the tough design 
decisions that I'm historically not very good at. I think I'm more a 
programmer than a games designer. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Editing in Space!</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-10-19)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> <b>The Editor</b><br><img src="6244&amp;log=1377_files/fleet10.html"><br><br>I
 started work on the editor a couple of days ago, and thanks to my 
cunning encapsulation of the actor code, this wasn't too hard.<br><br>It
 also wasn't too easy, when I realised just how deeply the actor code 
had it's claws in the main program. I had to really think hard about 
what code "counted" as part of the actor class, and what was seperate 
management code required purely for the game. I eventually managed it, 
and got some pretty cool results.<br><br>Firstly, the code carried over 
so well into the editor that the ships quite literally came alive when 
they were placed. For example, if two ships were placed very close to 
each other, they would actually start to move themselves around in the 
editor to make space! The AI was working perfectly, since ships try to 
avoid each other in the main game too. On a similar note, when deleting 
an actor from the editor, it would explode, just as if it had been 
destroyed in the main game.<br><br>Cool though this was, I had to add an
 "active" field to the actor type, so it could be easily disabled by the
 editor, and not take any action. Now I think about it, I should have 
held off on that until I had added the capability to choose the side for
 ships being added to the editor. Would have been fun to watch ships 
duke it out, while spontaneously adding new ones. And, for that matter, 
this could make an excellent testbed for ship designs. Perhaps I will 
include an "activate AI" option, so that artists can try out ships 
immediately.<br><br><b>Graphics</b><br>My obsession with explosions 
continues. A few more minor tweaks this time, so rather than chat about 
it I'll just show you a screenshot.<br><br><img src="6244&amp;log=1377_files/fleet6.html"><br><br>Also,
 here is an example of the Normal Mapping in action. The texture has 
since been improved, but you can get an idea of how it's useful for 
increasing the visual impact of an object without adding more geometry.<br><br><img src="6244&amp;log=1377_files/fleet5.html"><br><br>That's all for now, see you next time. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Interface in your face</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-10-11)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> I couldn't think of a good title, so that's what you've got.<br><br>I
 spent some time going over the engine a bit more and pulled out a few 
bugs. For example, friendly ships that were flying close to each other 
wouldn't try to avoid enemy ships until they were far too close.<br><br>I'll
 just mention something about that, actually. The engine is written with
 zero collision detection between ships. All the collision detection is 
weapon -&gt; ship.<br><br>Why? Well, for one thing, it saves a lot of 
collision checking. Since the ships are only given orders by the player,
 rather than directly controlled, I can have the program take over and 
ensure that collisions are avoided in good time, before a ship resumes 
it's course. So far the system works pretty well. My AI code isn't 
awesome, but this game isn't made for swarms of ships. I'm hoping for no
 more than sixteen ships total in an engagement. With the number of 
shots I'm throwing around in tests, that's going to be more than enough.<br><br><b>Performance</b><br>Actually,
 the projectile weapons tend to make my Athlon 3000+ XP chug a little, 
because there's so many shots in the air. I'm not particularly 
interested in reigning in the carnage though, at this stage. This isn't 
really a game I'm making with the intention of selling, so I'm not 
targetting it at a range of platforms. I just want to make something 
cool, for myself more than anything, although if it's good and playable 
I'll certainly make sure it's distributed in some form.<br><br>Also, I 
realised recently that I've been labouring under the misconception that 
my Athlon 3000+ CPU is still a modern and up-to-date processor. It 
really isn't. Three-and-a-half years old.<br><br><b>Interface</b><br>The
 first tentative steps at an interface have been laid. I have written an
 under-featured GUI routine for the buttons. This will be extended. I've
 also made the pointer context-sensitive, so that when friendly ships 
are selected, the "attack" cursor will appear over enemies and the 
"guard" cursor will appear over friendlies. And yes, the ships will do 
as they're told (which is actually the biggest and most significant 
achievement in this paragraph).<br><br><b>Graphics</b><br>I cam up with a
 few improvements to make the effects a little more interesting. These 
changes are all very minor and unimportant to the gameplay, but I wanted
 to make the engine more, you know, cool.<br><br>So, I juiced up the 
explosions while simultaneously making them less processor intensive. 
Firstly, there's a 10% chance that, when a projectile shot lands on 
something, it will make a bigger bang than normal. This gives the 
impression of the shot hitting something critical on the ship's hull 
every now and again. It's a purely visual effect, but it breaks up the 
effects a little so they look less samey.<br><br>Secondly, capital ship 
explosions now produce some cool little rays from the centre, just some 
basic polygons with an alpha-gradiant texture. There's also some pieces 
of debris, which I'm going to make look a bit better.<br><br><b>Code</b><br>I've
 come up against one or two coding challenges, and now that I'm down 
with Object Oriented concepts, I can definitely see the shortcomings of 
BASIC. However, I'm trying to incorporate OO principles into the way my 
code is structured in order to overcome certain issues. Here's an 
example of one.<br><br>I've been considering having modules that can be 
attached to ships that apply certain "buffs" to the stats. For example, 
increased firepower, increased speed, etc. I have a problem, though.<br><br>Each
 ship that is created is given a few individual characteristics, such as
 position, orientation, which side it's on, what it's supposed to be 
doing, etc. It also get's a link to the ship database, where the rest of
 the stats for that type of ship are stored. This means that I can have 
seven Knight class ships, each with their own individual jobs and 
positions. However, information that is the same for all Knight class 
ships, such as the maximum hull strength, can be pulled from the ship 
database entry for "Knight".<br><br>In English, each ship has it's own 
information about where it is and what it does, and each ship class has 
information about what turrets it has, how fast it goes, and how tough 
it is. So seven Knights get information about the Knight Class from the 
same place in the ship database.<br><br>I thought this was pretty neat. 
It cuts down on data duplication, so that every ship isn't carrying 
every single piece of data about it's class, when most of it's the same.<br><br>But
 what about buffs? If a ship requests to know it's maximum hull 
strength, how can I get a value back from the generic database that has a
 buff attached to it for this specific ship? I could add a condition 
every time the value is requested throughout the code, where the buff is
 added if it is present on that particular ship.<br><br>Or I could do it the encapsulated way, like with OO languages.<br><br>Don't worry, this is <i>very</i> easy.<br><br>I simply write a function as follows:<br><br><pre class="code">Function get_maxhull%(check.actor)
checkdata.actordata=getactordata.actordata(check\breed$)
Return checkdata\maxhull%
End Function
</pre><br><br>Just to clarify: actor is my ship type. It's called 
"actor" because everything that lives in the game goes here, not just 
ships. Missiles, projectiles, lasers are all actors. This does mean I 
have a fairly large Type, and not all entries are used, but after my 
experience with Drop Fighter, I realised it made much more sense.<br><br>getactordata returns a pointer to the relevant data for that breed of actor (eg "Knight").<br><br>Then, the return statement simply sends it back.<br><br>Big deal, it does exactly the same as if it had been accessed directly from the code, without going out to a function.<br><br>That's
 because I've not actually implemented buffs yet in the game, but now I 
have control over the value of maxhull that goes back out. In that 
routine, I can alter the Return statement to:<br><pre class="code">Return checkdata\maxhull%*check\buff_maxhull#
</pre><br><br>Where check\buff_maxhull# is '1' if there is no buff, or, 
say, '1.25' if there is a buff. I can just recalculate buffs whenever I 
need.<br><br>Currently, the plan is to have players choose modules 
(like, say, "Armour Plates") for each ship. Depending what is chosen, 
buffs will then be calculated before the game starts, and the correct 
amounts put in the buff_xxx fields.<br><br>All I need to do is makes 
sure I use get_maxhull(current.actor) instead of referencing the 
database entry directly.

 I put my turret aiming code to the test and updated the program to 
allow weapons to target projectiles like missiles. I was pleasantly 
surprised, after half an hour of banging my head on the table, to see 
that they did a great job!<br><br>No screenshots unfortunately, because this isn't really something you can get across in a screenshot, it happens so fast.<br><br>This
 does mean, though, that now we can have dedicated screening units in 
the game. Screening units are ships who have the job of protecting the 
bigger ships from missile fire. So the enemy will need to either use 
some serious missile spam, or send in ships to take out the screening 
units.<br><br>Hooray, actual tactics!<br><br>Enough procrastination, I need to get on with making the interface. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>I just had to...

Pretty cool, as it happens.<br><br>Actually,
 it wasn't entirely pointless. I wanted to throw a ship in there that 
had an arbitrary shape. A shape that I basically wasn't expecting. I've 
been trying to avoid building the AI in such a way that it needs that 
ships to meet specific guidelines, unlike the situation with Drop 
Fighter.<br><br>This time around, I was pleased to see that I was able 
to incorporate the Enterprise without much difficulty. I had to make a 
few minor tweaks and add a couple of rules. For example, fixed 
launchers, like the Enterprise's torpedo launcher, will no longer check 
if the line-of-sight between them and the enemy is clear of the ship's 
structure. Why? Well, normally, this check is performed to stop lasers 
trying to fire through their own ship if the turret is placed with a 
partly obscured line-of-fire. With fixed turrets, it's assumed that they
 will already be placed facing an non-dangerous direction. ie A fixed 
missile launcher won't be looking onto another part of the ship's 
structure, the space ahead of it will be unobstructed.<br><br>So, 
leaving out this line-of-sight check means that the missile will still 
fire even if the target is obscured, fly in the direction it's launcher 
is facing, and then curve around towards the target.<br><br>In order to 
incorporate the Enterprise, I had to do one other minor tweak: a 
half-second grace period before a missile starts homing, to ensure it 
doesn't suddenly turn into the ship. Normally, this wouldn't be an 
issue, but the missiles were tending to curve up and slam into the 
Enterprise's own saucer.<br><br>If I were to ever have a ship with fixed
 launchers halfway along it's structure, facing forward, this could 
arise again: missiles could weave sideways chasing their target and hit 
their own ship. Hopefully adding that half-second will keep them going 
straight for long enough. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Initial thoughts</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-10-02)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 I've realised recently that I enjoy trying out ideas more than anything
 else. I've got three or four things sitting on my hard drive that work 
very well in their own right, but function only as AI-powered demos for 
ideas I wanted to trial.<br><br>This may turn out to be another, but here goes.<br><br>I've
 always wanted to make a 3d space-fleet game, sort of like Homeworld, 
but with far fewer ships, and more options for each ship. And no 
resource management. I guess it leans towards Star Trek: Deep Space 
Nine: Dominion Wars in that respect.<br><br>My main goals for this project were:<br>-Get accurate turret targetting<br>-Include a variety of weapons: plasma bolts, lasers, missiles<br>-Allow ships to pick targets and attack them without user intervention<br>-Use an XML format to store data about ships and turrets, to make modifications easier<br><br>I've
 already achieved all these goals, but I'm so proud of how it all looks 
that I want to carry on. My next goals are as follows:<br><br>1) Include a basic orders system. "Attack that" "Stop"<br>2) Include a basic movement orders system.
