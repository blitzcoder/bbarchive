 It's been almost 2 years since my last entry. For those that may scan 
the work logs for entertainment, I am not dead and I haven't been idle 
in my coding habits.<br>-&gt; I've been continually working smaller side
 projects to help learn different aspects that I could incorporate into 
this main project. I've recoded a lot of key functions in Vonherin.<br>-&gt;
 For one I've developed a system that segments the world into 
instances/regions. The regions can be interconnected via invisible areas
 of transition. Each region's content is loaded during these transition 
points and is near instant though the possibility of certain objects 
maintaining persistence definitely exists.<br>-&gt; The system currently supports loading of these Objects:<br>Chests (and their inventories), Ladders, Bodies of Water, Npcs, Foliage, and Beds.<br><br>&gt;&gt;Old Objects: Description/Functionality<br>-&gt; Chests can be accessed to display their unique inventory and can be looted easily. <br>-&gt; Ladders can be scaled.<br>-&gt; Bodies of water are defined as a transition layer of a width/depth that can be swam in/slows movement speed. <br>-&gt;
 NPCs can be hostile or non-hostile, and have phrases to say when talked
 to. Currently 4 different hard-coded classes with equipment that's 
customizable.<br>-&gt; Foliage is kind've self-explanatory.<br><br>&gt;&gt;New Object: Bed<br>-&gt;
 Beds are a convenient way to speed up the passage of time. 
Debuffs/Buffs are affected by this change in time pacing. Which can be 
useful if needing to get rid of an annoying Debuff that isn't life 
threatening. Can be claimed/slept in. The view range whilst being in bed
 is severely reduced.<br><br>&gt;&gt;Side Note:<br>-&gt; Prior coding 
achievements haven't been lost and will be repurposed to help expedite 
progress on this latest iteration of Vonherin.<br>-&gt; Applys to equipment related functions, sheathing and unsheathing.<br><br>&gt;&gt;Planned Objects<br>-&gt; Newer Furnace System<br>-&gt; Ores System<br>-&gt; Doors<br>-&gt; Switches/Mechanisms for Activation<br>-&gt; Fire/Torches<br><br>&gt;&gt;Day/Nite Cycle<br>-&gt;
 Color Gradient for the sky/lighting has been added and is determined 
but a read_pixel function from it, updated once per minute.<br><br>&gt;&gt;Ticks<br>-&gt;
 The game is updated in segments of time/ticks, some events happen per 
second, per minute, per hour or per day. This is to help regulate the 
timing of events and help eliminate any lag associated with a function 
that doesn't need to operate continuously.<br><br>&gt;&gt;Inventory<br>-&gt;
 New system with a higher level of stability and finding of specific 
details. A lot of systems received an upgrade with regards to pointer 
handling to prevent having to cycle through lists to get the info 
required for some functions.<br>-&gt; Supported Functions:<br>   -&gt; Copying of the inventory to another<br>   -&gt; Drag/Drop of items within interface<br>   -&gt; Swapping Of Items<br>   -&gt; Stacking Of Items<br>   -&gt; Dropping Of Items<br>   -&gt; Adding directly to a stack under max stack count<br>-&gt; Suffixs/Prefixs are Disabled atm<br><br>&gt;&gt;Recipes or Using of Items on Other Items<br>-&gt; Disabled atm <br><br> ~~Vonherin Developer~~ </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Update!!</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">2015-05-20</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Its good to be back.<br>I've
 recently been working on several other projects in development of this 
core game. These projects consisted of several different inventory 
systems - in order to see what direction I can do with Vonherin's 
current inventory system. I don't like the way armor is handled all too 
well. Because armor slots are treated as flagged bag type slots. It 
creates a lot of conditionals for absolutely no reason when the armor 
slots could be an entirely different type. Making some updates imposed 
on the armor slots take more time, having to cycle through all the 
invent slots to then find the armor slot.<br><br><img src="15985&amp;log=1872_files/fye8pd.jpg"><br><img src="15985&amp;log=1872_files/286sk2.jpg"><br><br>New Inventory Features:<br>&gt;&gt;Functionality<br>Primary and Secondary Mouse Click Function Utilization.<br>-&gt; Left Click on a usable Item will result in EQUIP, DRINK etc.<br>-&gt; Right Click produces a small drop down window to select a few options.<br>-&gt; Equipment Slots and Bag Slots are Different Arrays altogether.<br>-&gt; Main bag is easily accessible with HOT_KEY of "E"<br>-&gt; Equipment is easily accessible with HOT_KEY of "Q"<br>-&gt; Recipes have been converted into a USE_ITEM -&gt; ON -&gt; OTHER_ITEM = RESULTANT ITEM ~.<br><br>&gt;&gt;Display<br>-&gt; Less Media Dependent<br>-&gt;
 Hovering over an item will display its given bonuses - if the item is 
considered equipment it will try to compare it to any applicable worn 
equipment.<br>-&gt; An item is capable of having both a prefix and suffix, from which the item's attributes are enhanced.<br>-&gt; Items come with a weight attribute to determine carry weight, attack speed, dodge rating. Etc.<br>-&gt; Items with prefixes/suffixes are noticeable with applicable item-skins.<br>-&gt;
 Now new weapon variants, dagger, mace, axe, essence, wand, knives, 
darts, crossbows. -Designed to the 3 applicable combat styles.<br>-&gt; Now displays PlayerName$ / Username$ in Equipment Window.<br>-&gt;
 Item attributes are not determined by the type of item, left like this 
on purpose. Adds true grinding for the "PERFECT" item in some 
situations.<br>-&gt; Items have a item level that determines all the points put towards an item's attribute list.<br><br>&gt;&gt;Note:<br>Key aspects of foliage have been disabled to test Client -&gt; Server Speed <br><br> ~~Vonherin Developer~~ </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Sites</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">2014-10-06</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> <img src="15985&amp;log=1872_files/2rfbsw6.jpg"> <br><br> ~~Vonherin Developer~~ </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Vonherin</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">2014-09-21</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> ~Massive Update~<br><br>1.

draped with vines and may have mushrooms placed at its roots.<br>4. Magical Attacks have added sprite effects that enhance their visibility and kind've explode on impact.<br>5.
 Combat Triangle: Melee Armor blocks arrows much better than Archer

 I took a break to brainstorm where I wanted to go with my project. 
Seeing as how its simply a hobby of mine I don't dedicate 100% of my 
time to it and so updates do indeed suffer. After these couple of weeks 
i've created a few more updates to shovel out.<br><br><img src="15985&amp;log=1872_files/2dgsz90.jpg"><br><br>&gt;Combat<br>-fixed
 a display issue with slashing with swords in general: sometimes when 
taking damage it would offset the slash sprite, this has been fixed.<br>-added
 a 'Running/Jumping Combo Attack' - user must be running and mid jump 
while holding left click to perform spinning forward slash. (Swords only
 at the moment) Mages will have barrier generated for the duration 
(shield small amounts of damage), Archers will passively be granted a 
small movement speed buff. (Class depiction can vary in a fight: class 
is merely designed to indicate what type of weapon class the player is 
using. Staff:Mage, Wand:Mage, Dagger:Warrior, Sword:Warrior, 
Bow:Archer... etc.)<br>-Shielding no longer blocks 40% of incoming 
damage, this has been reduced to 15%, 40% was far too great and 
basically made you something similar to Armor Lock from Halo 4.<br>-Enemies
 now fall backwards instead of forwards upon death. Felt it fitting to 
"blow away your enemies" rather than have them come falling onto you. :)<br>-There's now a damage indicator of its origin. A small sprite that points in the direction of sought after damage.<br>-Enemies
 will now attempt to use a generic ability called 'Kick' if they see 
your charging up to deal more DPS. 'Kick' knocks the player back for a 
small amount but disables any charging of attacks.<br>-Playing 
"peek-a-boo" with casters as enemies is a little harder to do but still 
possible. It was possible to gauge the time between casts as to simply 
jump over them and mid-air cast at them, avoiding possible damage. This 
applied to Archers as well.<br>-All weapons have been slightly edited 
for stacking the following items onto the player's back: 
Quiver/Shield/Weapon. They now correctly displace each other rather than
 merge and intersect becoming quite an eye sore.<br><br>&gt;Environment<br>-Grass
 has been updated to be a little less dense. A little more responsive to
 wind with regards to YAW#. The variant of herb is now a fern-like plant
 in the ground rather than a red flowering plant.<br>-Trees have 
increased definition, I attempted to add individualized 'wind effect' to
 their leaves but my efforts only reduced FPS but it did look good :d<br>-Clouds,
 my cloud system is still going strong it helps blend the water and sky,
 as well as to the rest of the world against the background of CLSCOLOR.<br>-Sky_Tex:
 Altered to a greater contrast to increase bloom effect; it was so bad 
that the sky appeared a grey-ish distorted color... After I got a nice 
deep blue that is just beautiful.<br><br>&gt;Inventory<br>-Upon opening disables the ability to run.<br><br>&gt;Controls<br>-Now have the ability to run with shift. Increases movement speed by 20% -no cost (yet)<br><br>-While running you may now use the mouse as a mouse_look to turn the player much faster than that of key_downs.<br><br>&gt;Mini-map<br>-I
 have removed the minimap because I would like the player to openly 
discover what the rest of the world looks like; however, I would like to
 still show the areas the player has been as these old places would not 
fall into that category.<br><br>&gt;Armor/Weapons<br>-Armor has been 
recolored to reflect the different tiers. These are subject to change 
because some of the colors are borderline neon.  (Only Tier 2, Like neon
 green -&gt; Becoming a Dark Green soon.)<br><br><img src="15985&amp;log=1872_files/6p9v6h.jpg"><br><br>&gt;Thoughts/Notes&lt;<br>-Thinking
 of converting from generic b3d terrains to Mesh ones. I experimented 
around with mesh terrains and the power behind the ability to edit them 
is immense for some of the effects id like to achieve and re-create 
within my game. Not to mention better handling of no-clip and clipping. <br><br> ~~Vonherin Developer~~ </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Slight Revisions</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">2014-07-13</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> &gt;Changes to Combat<br>-Charged attack's particle effects have been revised to fly away from and orbit the player mesh.<br>-Charged
 attacks no longer use up all the energy charged on the initial engage, 
each attack subtracts up to a total of 60%-40% of the player's charged 
energy on a successful attack. This has been put like this for increased
 combat efficiency with rangers and mages as they are (mainly magers) 
heavily dependent on Stamina/Mana values that are subtracted from to 
create charged energy.<br>-Added a few new animations and features.<br>-Theres now an animation for crafting an item.<br>-Theres
 now a shielding animation for shielding. (Activated on Right Click) - 
Shields 40% of incoming damage when in this position.<br><br>&gt;Changes to player (General Features)<br>-Texture slightly modified in certain areas.<br>-All Tier 1 Models have been updated to fit the new player mesh.<br>-Can
 have sheathing toggled, to either have the item in hand at all times or
 keep it sheathed like normal after you're done with an attack.<br>-Running has been implemented, the player now has this ability and it requires no stamina/mana to do at the moment.<br><br>&gt;Changes to World<br>-Water/Trees/Grass/Sky
 all revised, there were still some shading issues with the water and 
sky added together. Sky have been updated to compensate for excessive 
bloom in certain light levels. Transparency was a big issue, I didn't 
want the player to be able to really see everything from far away (the 
stuff under the water) so I had to play around with the alpha values of 
some of the layers I used to construct the water as a whole. Trees have 
had a slight adjustment to compensate for better looking shadow 
definition, though the world doesn't involve any sort of occlusion 
effects it can still 'mimic' the effect.<br>-Terrain has a greater increase in detail.

item durability, item value, item crafting, recipe discovery, tools, 
weapons, and armor all on the fly.<br><br>2. The game currently supports 15 different skills.<br>Include but not limited to: Archery, Magic, Swimming, and Cooking.<br><br>3.
 New Camera System that can support dynamic cinematic views of new 
areas. (Much like The Legend of Zelda can, aka new room or area) &lt;- 
Made this smoother... <br><br>4. The Player has the option to 
individually train each skill to make them a better archer or melee 
specialization. Or Cook, etc. Free choice.<br><br>5. Ability book, 
abilities become unlocked as your skills go up, if you train your 
archery you gain more archery derived abilities; so on and so forth.<br><br>6. Complex day and night cycle based on actual 24-hour clock that's in-game.<br><br>7. Able to view all Skill-Related attributes (Haven't added the ability list) - such as xp till next level, and current xp.<br><br>8. Implemented saving once again, tracking of player, mobs, items, drops, and effects on everything.<br><br>9. Abilities include but aren't limited to:<br>Abilities that freeze, snare, burn, heal, slow, silence, lifesteal, cone, and aoe.<br><br>10.
 Player movement across the terrain is flawless now, makes combat way 
smoother but there is a limit to the angle that can be traversed.<br><br>11.
 Tiering system is implemented, boost gear that is exponentially 
affected. Power level 1 item that is tier 1 has base stats that are 1^1 =
 1 while Power level 2 item that is tier 2 has base stats that are 2^2 =
 4 and Power level 2 item that has a tier of 3 is 2^3 = 8 so on and so 
forth.<br><br>12. Equipment affects overall stats, boosts any skill bonus it may have or would seem to provide.<br><br>13. New Splash screen, and profile selection screen.<br><br>14. Three-dimensional mini-map and full map for viewing of the local area (rest is hidden in fog if you haven't been there)<br><br>-I'm continuing to work as hard as i can to pump this game out with my free time. <br><br> ~~Vonherin Developer~~ </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Turning To 3rd Person.</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">2013-07-27</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Sorry, I've been working non-stop and it hasn't yielded enough time to get on the forums to post something new.<br><br>Created
 an "Item List Editor" to handle the creation of recipes and new 
items/vs their image on the fly so that process has been greatly 
increased.<br><br>I was happy with the last setup for the character that
 I had created for the game. However, I've always liked the 3rd person 
games over 1st person games. So, I've changed the camera into a very 
dynamic and accurate system. Capable of creating situations (such as cut
 scenes). I completely rewrote the inventory system from the ground-up. 
Completely reworked the AI system behind every creature within the game,
 featuring smoother movement and Non-Collision-Based entity placement 
(FPS Increase)/All Math.<br><br>I'll release a screenshot soon and 
perhaps a video. Attack-Systems have been fully implemented with dynamic
 leveling of combat-based skills, combat effects (Bleed, Heal, Slow, 
Stun).<br><br>Ability to drop items from the inventory into the world 
freely, and Creatures/Monsters have unofficial drop lists. (Drops 
certain items, vary between each set but "Bones" and Other generic 
things stay the same.<br><br>Armor and Weapons affect the efficiency of Blocking, Dealing Damage to/from Creatures or other damage factors (Besides Effects)<br><br>Implementing dynamic character editing (Hair,Body,Etc etc).<br><br>-Redoing the save-world function.

 I took a few days off and went back to work. Targeting main display 
bugs within every feature of the game. Retexturing and  creating newer 
content that reflects my current skill in graphics, modelling, and 
coding.<br><br>-Bug Fixes.<br>1. Global light_level# variable not 
recording correctly (days became slightly offset upon each save roughly 
2.5% degree of error; fixed its precision.<br>2. Slight display issue between entities z-buffer essentially overlapping.<br>3. Increased player's ability to get over general terrain features (reduced workload of getting around)<br>4.
 Cleaning of unessential calculations or moving them to a queue of 
events to be handled when needed rather than always running. <br>5. 
Fixed the occasional "Flip back to start menu" - was caused by a corrupt
 world save i.e if the world failed to create; result of closing early 
or some other issue involving inappropriate shutdown of the program.<br>6. Reduced run speed.<br>7. More commands added.. really just for me. ;D<br>8. New recipes added to obtain all items.<br>9. Spawning with wood.<br>10. Dieing on spawn (very RARE)<br>11. Corrupted terrain, aka.. its rather very flat.. or sketchy (looks like spiky hair)<br>12. General lagg from the terrain and other things.<br>13. Sky box has been removed, not a real feature really. <br><br> ~~Vonherin Developer~~ </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Taking a Break, Reporting Progress</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">2013-04-23</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Im taking a break for a bit, im immensely tired of day after day of coding.<br>1. I successfully reworked the entire layout and appearance of my login routines and speed.<br>2. Updated Lightmapping to be more dynamic and more realistic to sun-positioning.<br>3. Mesh Terrain implementation is still WIP.<br>4. Need a .lib for checking if the player were to exit the program without hitting escape (wont save otherwise)<br><br>-Many more Features added. <br>1.
 When attacking a creature the player gains "Instinct" might change the 
variable to "Rage" or some other form of energy that the player may then
 use to cast spells or do special attacks on creatures.<br>2. Currently 
there only exists 20 different generic spells (blasts of magical energy 
pretty much) which tier according to level. (1-70) -might add Cooldown 
periods for spells.<br>3. Quest System is in slight dev. NPCS spawn with a quest variable.<br>4.
 Reworked how World Selection appears, might add a preview to the world.
 :D -Rotating MiniWorld for the player to browse slightly.<br>5. 
Advanced Item Info added: When hovering over an item, displays 
Name/Rarity/Price: Doesn't allow the string of information to be written
 off-screen. Allows on top as well.<br>6. Added several different recipes, longest recipe currently requires 5 different layouts to create 1 of the said items.<br>7. Need to add more items in general only 67 different items exist in the game.<br>8. Ai, cancelled atm for debug.<br>9. Increased Terrain Interaction: No more getting stuck on high-ratio climbs.<br>10. Optimized many text-based drawings to images.<br>11. Combat system is being re-worked from its basis. Weapons will keep proper tier of damage.<br>12.
 My River Function (The Function that Creates a River in the map) - Only
 works Along the Y Axis (with reference to an image rather than a 3D 
space).. which bothers me i wish to have a rather windy path for a 
river... WIP<br>13. Speed in water dramatically reduced, ratio LAND/WATER (3:2 to 3:1)<br>14.
 Increased administrative control, Average FPS control, Lag-resistance 
commands: Affecting environment updates. Might add a global "Que" for 
events based on priority and distance from the actual view area.<br>15. Finally, Smooth Jumping, well.. smoother, previous jumping would sometimes be rather difficult to control. <br><br> ~~Vonherin Developer~~ </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Delayed Post</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">2013-04-15</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Sorry, we recently had a power outage in my area and have been up able to post for a bit.<br><br>-Current Progress-<br>1. Implementation of mesh terrain is quite difficult... (WIP)<br>2. Finally made a good mesh for a willow tree.<br>3.
 Creatures are assigned random ai based on intelligence values, 
attributes can include utility towards attacking player or getting away 
as well as personal utility to re-heal.<br>4. Weather system tweaked, 
transitional periods now set to 4000 from 1000, I don't want it to rain 
back to back. 4000 being the minimum period in which to start the 
probability of it becoming a certain weather (light,medium,heavy rain, 
or snow)<br>5. Sun cycle also tweaked occasionally after setting a 
certain TOD(time of day): the sun isn't in the right corresponding spot.
 5 to 15 degrees off that's now fixed.<br>6. Inventory System optimized to have multiple bags and storage devices rather than just the player's inventory.<br>7. Increased General particle usage.<br>8. Increased Foliage effects. Previous:Wind, Current:Wind,Player,Other Foliage.<br>9. Only render whats in view- FPS increase by +5.<br>10. Average FPS, 25-30. 30 being maximum.<br>11. Added the ability to customize layouts.<br>12. Might add personal recipes.<br>13. Might add the ability to 'unlock' certain recipes (efficiency etc)<br>14. Have a list of all recipes ever crafted and can be accessed for reference.<br>15. Considering adding full-integration of dungeons and exploration aspects. Cross-Dimensional Travel. 1D,2D,3D,4D<br>etc<br><br>Note:
 Most are ideas that i simply propose here to write down my thoughts and
 possible actions. Often enough about 80% of my goals that don't

 I Finally finished the new ai systems and im quite happy with them, 
(will release a video of them soon). Recently i wanted to make the 
inventory optimized as possible and promote an active use of it. I 
completely re-wrote the code that generated or placed items into the 
inventory. The previous one was horrible to understand, i optimized it 
with 40 less lines of code which, in my opinion is quite impressive. Idk
 what i was thinking during its creation but, it certainly wasn't what i
 am now. <br><br>Suggest to Create item &gt; Check for Bag &gt; Check 
for bag Space &gt; Check for empty slot/Check for stack &gt; If stack 
add to stack &gt; if empty add to empty slot &gt; if stack is full &gt; 
move to next stack in "Que" S\id=S\Id+1 &gt; Repeat.<br><br><br>Bug Fixes by doing this.<br><br>-Possibility to create "Ghost" items. Basically null-data values.<br>-Sometimes items just wouldnt stack or had odd-behavior.<br>-Spawn outside of inventory and create an error (RARE)<br>-Occasional loss of item if bag or bank became to full upon loading. Spawn on items etc...<br>-Overall speed<br>-Fit for the new mouse-system. <br><br> ~~Vonherin Developer~~ </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>AI Progress.</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">2013-04-07</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Creatures Now have a priority task system assigned to certain Ai Layouts.<br><br>Such as obvious things like:<br>- going up for air when swimming to avoid drowning.<br>-
