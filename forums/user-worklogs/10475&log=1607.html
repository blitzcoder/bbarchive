 Been working on adding the mg42 functions and functionality to the 
bunker defense.  Also modeled 3 new bunkers, all with complete interior 
rooms as well.<br><br>Heres a couple of screens of the mg42:<br><img src="10475&amp;log=1607_files/cb7.webp"><br><br><img src="10475&amp;log=1607_files/cb8.webp"> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Added Effects</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2008-05-14)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Today I added water splashes to exact place a shell impacts the water. 
 This was a MUST when firing at ships far in the distance because you 
can't see if you're shooting too far or short without it.  Also added a 
ground impact to the beach directly below the player for both his shells
 and enemy shells. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>First Impressions</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2008-05-13)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 I'm creating a shooting game where the player is in charge of defending
 a beach from invasion.  The player is able to walk around freely to 
fortified locations and use the appropriate defensive weapons to deal 
with the threat he deems most hazardous.  These include, a bunker 
mounted anti-ship battery, an stationary anti-aircraft cannon, and an 
emplaced MG42.  So far I've only completed the shore-mounted anti-ship 
cannon.  The player at first will probably use this cannon to defend 
against landing craft and possible also sink some enemy ships.  It is 
however highly uneffective against troops once they land on the beach.  
It is also useless against aircraft.  The AA gun will not be very 
effective against troops either, but will most likely be used against 
aircraft.  Finally, the MG42 is very effective against landing troops, 
but not as effective against aircraft and useless against ships. <br><br>How the game works:<br>Hundreds
 of landing craft will spawn (not at once, 15-20 at a time) and attempt a
 landing on the beach, while ships further out at sea, but still in 
range of the player, will be shelling the player.  Also, aircraft will 
swarm in in sorties and do bombing runs and strafing of the coast in 
preparation for the landing troops.  <br><br>The player will be required
 to achieve certain tasks to advance to the next scenario.  For 
instance, sink 15 landing craft, or shoot down 3 aircraft, or sink a 
certain ship.<br><br>I have some early screenshots of ships off-shore, but thats about it.<br><br>The
 picture below:  Here we see 3 ships, 2 destroyers and a heavy cruiser. 
 The destroyer on the right is badly damaged, on fire, and sinking.  The
 cruiser is of course the larger ship towards the center.<br><img src="10475&amp;log=1607_files/cb4.webp"><br><br>The picture below:  A landing craft blowing up!  I know I need some more beach clutter, just haven't got it done yet.  <br><img src="10475&amp;log=1607_files/cb5.webp"><br><br>The
 picture below:  The cannon has 2 crewmembers, a commander and a gunner.
  This is the commander's view, who also has binoculars.  Here we see 
many landing craft close to the beach, with a few large ships so far 
away they look like blobs!<br><img src="10475&amp;log=1607_files/cb6.webp"> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
