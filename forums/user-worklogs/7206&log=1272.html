 is really very cool. Unfortunately, running in a window is now out of 
the question since Windows treats the drawing tablet as a mouse (even 
though I have access to absolute coordinates on the tablet, as a float 
from 0 to 1). Regardless, quite fun.<br><br>Edit: Rats! My screenshot isn't working :( Too bad... Anyway, it's a bunch of swirly lines falling downwards...<br><br>Before anyone says "crayon physics clone", I should make this clear: This game is not a clone.<br><br>Rather,
 I am going in a number of fresh directions. First off, since this uses 
verlet physics, it is completely possible to create squishy and 
breakable objects. For that matter, it is necessary to!<br><br>Secondly,
 this is by no means a puzzle game. I am working on a strategy approach,
 though single player mode will probably have puzzles due to my complete
 incompetence with AI. (Granted, I am also terrible at designing 
puzzles. That's all a long way off, however).<br><br>I mentioned "single
 player mode". Yes, this is probably going to be multiplayer. Still 
undecided whether I will be doing a turn based approach, a real time 
thing or both. Multiplayer + physics sounds like suicide, but thankfully
 the physics engine here is extremely primitive and inefficient. That 
also means it makes no "guesses", and is very predictable across 
platforms.<br><br>My current plan is a resource management approach, 
where actually acquiring things and stopping opponents is a matter left 
entirely to your imagination. To keep the game from going mad, drawing 
is limited to a small portion of the scene. Actually getting creations 
to have an impact elsewhere is where the game gets really tricky... but I
 will leave that for when I have something to show off.<br><br>As for 
catch phrases and names, Intelligent Design strikes me as something that
 would grab a lot of attention, for better or worse. The project name 
for this version is "Plato". Mentioning alchemy and ancient Greek 
philosophers in the same place is by no means a coincidence.<br><br>Today's
 problem: Points are added for every single frame that the user is 
pressing with the pen. While an amazing tech demo (no major slowdowns 
yet! Computers have come a long way), this is really confusing the 
physics engine and wasting memory. Oh, and it's stupid.<br>I need to 
either put a timer on this or have it only add points when the pen moves
 a certain amount. Both solutions sound pretty arbitrary... I may want 
to track the angle of movement, so when it changes significantly a point
 is added. That way, important details in an object are not lost.<br>Next
 up are collisions and physics stability. Right now, objects pass 
straight through each other, and sometimes disappear into thin air :( <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Decoupling...</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2008-01-06)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Complete decoupling...<br>"Don't
 do it!" bellowed the cobweb which had fully formed between my forehead 
and the closed door of my room. I decided not to follow that advice 
completely, since spiderwebs tend to be quite inaccurate (a pig? 
intelligent? Hah!). I did not let the moment pass gently, though. 
Clearly, I was going too far. I seemed to have embarked on a mad journey
 to create a computer game whose graphics, physics and input components 
never knew that each other existed, and where the only thing that knew 
about them all was a three-line main loop.<br>That a spiderweb had just 
talked to me was a nice reminder that this quest had been initiated 
following an "epiphany" in the morning of January 1st. The numerous 
typos in my leftover pseudo-code's comments were suddenly quite 
telling...<br><br>The system I had come up with was, in a few ways, 
fairly cool. I had a few central objects for things in the scene, and 
each of those hosted a bunch of Components, which passively handled 
graphics, physics, networking and the like. The cool part with those 
components is that any component could be added and removed at any time 
with no changes to the actual object. The other cool part is that the 
scene objects maintained some very simple information, with 
graphics-specific stuff divided nicely into the graphics components.<br>The
 "neato" part came with eventual net code. Theoretically, this meant 
that an object could easily be created with an additional networing 
component that quietly ensured consistent positioning of objects between
 client and server. The main loop, graphics and physics code would be 
none the wiser!<br><br>The bad part is that I had a whole bunch of 
objects created for each component of each thing in my scene. I had 
designed this to ensure only needing to iterate through every scene 
object once, but I had instead done something far worse: I was iterating
 through each object in the scene, then around three components for each
 object. Some of those components, like the graphics one, had to do yet 
more fiddling with loops because they like to have quite a pile of 
information only available in the scene objects.<br>At that point, 
chances of having graphics implemented as a blind component seemed quite
 hopeless. In addition, I was wondering how the heck a menu system would
 be implemented and rendered without either a huge Select block or a 
whole bunch of different graphics object components. It was then, 
following a fifteen minute debate raging inside my skull, that the 
spiderweb gave me its message. Code cowboyism returned to my veins, and 
minutes of backspacing later I created a very nice, simple system with 
divided front and back ends where I have finally accepted the fact that I
 do not currently need to use the "Extends" or "Abstract" keywords in 
any extensive (or Extensible) way.<br><br>Anyone thinking that a system 
like this Components thingimabob is a good idea, consider function 
pointers or the existing Hooks. They are simple and do not work nicely 
in huge quantity for a very good reason: because creating a million 
objects to support ten thousand objects is a <i>very bad idea</i>. If 
those do not work (as I thought for some reason during my intoxicated 
epiphany), at least remember that attempts at symmetry will ultimately 
prove useless at the lower levels anyway (graphics do not work like 
physics), so may as well not be attempted in the high level code either.

I was <a href="http://www.deltahumanesociety.org/" target="_blank">using PHP</a>
 for a long while, but I've learned to not classify it as programming. 
It's just weird and I think it has contributed to my recent lapse. 
Really, what kind of language has Variable Variables? It's a fine idea 
and fitting with the hash-tabley way that it works, but try saying 
"variable variable" aloud without sounding like a dork, hm?<br>The good 
news there is that over this time I have unlearned some bad habits of 
the past, so this BlitzMax stuff which I've moved on to should prove 
nicer than my past code.<br><br>I have recently engaged in toying with 
Simon's MiniB3D. The engine I am sort of developing off of it is not 
really the same (I am drifting in a very different direction at this 
point) but it is certainly small and Blitz3Dish and following along with
 MiniB3D's efforts very closely. Currently my intent is to trim stuff 
away from the 3D engine and move it to an Extension system. The core 
engine will be a skeleton, and then piles of extensions will power 
everything from culling to physics.<br><br>The advantage to this 
approach is that features can be added to the engine in a way that is 
both indirect and tidy; no changes have to be done to the engine even 
though those new features work at a very low level. With an extension 
system, a new feature like a shadow system can theoretically be enabled 
by importing an extension and calling its initialization code.<br>This 
also means that every bit of code can hopefully be worked on 
independently and will continue to work even after updates. (For 
example, an update - even to TMesh - will not break someone's personal 
.glah loader).<br><br>When it works, it will be very cool!<br>Of course,
 that's the catch: "When it works". This thing is proving an interesting
 puzzle. It isn't really a whole lot of code, but there is always a 
nagging feeling that every time I change something, some possibility 
becomes impossible. <br><br>It needs to be possible to create a file 
loader extension on the same whim as a new graphics feature, and it also
 needs to be possible to load them in the same way. That is a much more 
difficult puzzle than it seems because while a file loader may want to 
be extended one way, RenderWorld wants to be extended another way. While
 that loaded extension won't need to go anywhere but the file loader; 
the graphics feature might want a function of its own and maybe to 
completely remove another chunk of code; a physics extension will want 
to change the behaviour of the entity movement commands, what happens in
 UpdateWorld, as well as introduce dozens of its own functions that 
integrate with MiniB3D.<br>It gets weird and headache-inducing... fast.<br><br>Originally
 I was using a really stupid design in which information on Extensions 
was stored in maps full of strings (Keys) linking to other strings 
(Values). I later changed that to a hash table, and then I fully 
realized that it was stupid. The good news is that I finally learned 
about hash tables. They're quite cool, and it's always nice to learn 
what all these techy terms are; it really demystifies everything, but 
not in the bad way. Now I can join that "In crowd" that always seems to 
be talking about their hash :b<br>Long story short for the uninitiated, a
 hash table is a way to speed up comparison, storing and lookup of 
strings by turning them into more sensible variable types using 
convoluted equations. (String comparison is SLOW, Integer comparison is 
fast).<br>So anyway, that was a very stupid design. Now I am using 
something a bit more interesting which I think will shape up to be THE 
ONE. With this extension system, I want it to be as easy to write an 
extension as it is to create extendible code. With that in mind, someone
 should be able to create an extendible extension or to pull out this 
Extensions system and use it with ease even in their own projects.<br><br>The
 plan is Containers. An Extension container is placed at any part of the
 program that wants to be extended. For example, TMesh has a global 
TMesh_LoadMesh_ExtensionContainer container. Every time LoadMesh is 
called, this container is told to execute a list of functions stored 
inside of it. With Containers, making code extendible can be as simple 
as defining a container and calling its Update function in the code to 
be made extendible.<br><br>Originally the idea was that Extensions would
 define what they are by a list of Key/Value combinations, and then 
whenever an Extension is created every Container would look at it using a
 callback function. If a container liked the values set by an extension,
 it would add it to its list of contained extensions to be executed with
 its Update method.<br><br>Recently, though, I rethought that idea. It 
was a daft design because it reduced the control for both Extensions and
 Containers and instead placed it entirely on luck. Potentially nice in 
that a Container could theoretically be able to sneakily snatch up any 
extensions that fit a criteria (for example, a new container could want 
to use mesh loader Extensions), but really it was just stupid and not to
 mention difficult. I will maybe address the idea in the future because 
covertly recognizing and snatching Extensions could be pretty cool in 
terms of the goal for everything to be developed seperately, but for now
 any such design will do nothing but distract me.<br><br>Now if code 
wants to be extendable it can just create a container globally (as 
described previously) and then an Extension can add itself to that 
container explicitly. Alternatively, as with a TMesh_LoadMesh extension,
 code can define a new TExtension class that extends TExtension to store
 some more values. For example, TExtension_LoadMesh has an additional 
field called FileType. (I'm still working on variable naming consistency
 here, as you can see). With this design an Extension has to know what 
it is extending and it has to know how to extend it. To write a file 
loader extension, one must create an instance of TExtension_LoadMesh and
 add that to TMesh_LoadMesh_ExtensionContainer; to create an extension 
that just adds a call to RenderWorld, one has to create a generic 
extension and apply it to the correct container.<br><br>I should take 
now to point out in my usual word-swapping rambly way that an Extension 
is really a collection of individual functions, and that the functions 
are in fact what I have been referring to as Extensions. Extensions hold
 data, while functions get dumped in containers. Crazy, yes, but 
hopefully it will work when it's in code.<br><br><br><br>Why did I start
 playing with MiniB3D, anyway? Well, it all winds back to Equilibrium, 
which is my development name for "The Game" described below. It has some
 decent preliminaries now, and hopefully once the Extensions system is 
in I will be able to muddle together a Newton Physics Engine Extension, 
thus having a working engine on which to build Equilibrium. (Me? 
Procrastinating? Of course not!).<br><br><br><b>APE</b>? It's deceased. 
Not really deceased; it's going to be reincarnated. BlitzMax's abilities
 are perfect for it. It has changed direction and is now going to be an 
editor base with no mention of physics anywhere. I will not rest until 
someone can get Pong running in it. Consider it the Emacs of 3D editors.<br>That
 first version does work fairly well to mark hitboxes and the like 
around a mesh and has been used at least once (by me) to mark hotspots 
for a 3D diagram.<br>I probably won't do anything with it until 
OpenWorld/Arena/Whatever becomes a bit more realistic, because I hope to
 pile them both into the same general extendability ideas, hopefully in 
such a way that one complements the other. Since Equilibrium now 
actually has a direction and a chance to be built in the next century 
without me getting bored and moving back to APE beforehand, APE probably
 will not be its editor.<br>Both ideas are more undeveloped than usual, so I'm unusually ignoring them. They might be good ideas, though, some day.<br><br><br><b>Equilibrium</b>'s direction? It does have one, I promise. Some lurking and a <a href="http://forums.indiegamer.com/archive/index.php/t-9600.html" target="_blank">single question</a>
 asked at IndieGamer.com has led me to meditative games. The vision at 
the moment is sort of a gradual design that flows. It stays complex at 
heart, but everything is unified under a single concept. While the game 
does have a lot of stuff where different elements have different impacts
 (explosions, etc. are fun! Not sure if I explained the cannons on each 
board, but the idea is that a cannon fires a projectile of whatever 
element the board it is on is made out of). I am going to leave that 
fancy "how to make things explode" stuff entirely up to the player to 
discover; I do not want to swamp anyone with long descriptions of 
anything. There is no "this is a useful material to attack with"; just 
easy seeming gameplay with a twist.<br>For the sake of that flow thing, this should hopefully come down to a single mouse button to control the game. <a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=65892" target="_blank">TeraBit's Contour Cam</a>
 demo really inspired me in that regard. It showed me that the 
impossible is possible; I can have 3D camera controls that do not 
necessarily require button presses, thus making this a lot less 
complicated!<br><br><br><br>I've dropped and merged a lot of garbage so 
everything I am doing feels pretty sane now. Finally. Lots of it 
(Grasshopper, maybe APE) will probably happen for Equilibrium, but won't
 happen until Equilibrium needs them. Joy!<br><br><br>Okay, I'd better 
add something useful to this. Good news! Thanks to Google, we are now 
safe from unknowingly breaking patent laws! (Which is either good or 
bad, depending on how you look at it. So much for truthfully claiming 
ignorance).<br><a href="http://www.google.com/patents" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/patents</a> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>That bug in Grasshopper</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-11-15)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 As some people may be aware, Grasshopper has a serious bug which makes 
it unusable in Opera; it assumes plugins to always be located in the 
/browser/plugins directory, which is not true. (Opera puts them in 
/browser/DATA/plugins).<br><br>Thankully, the eventual fix is one which actually forces me to push Grasshopper forward to something a bit more complete.<br><br>There
 are many ways to fix this, but they tend to require hard-coded browser 
recognition to hunt down the Plugins registry entry for a particular 
browser, which seems just as easily screwed up as before. Thus, I have 
two possibilities:<br><br>-There may be a function/property in NPAPI 
which tells me where the browser's Plugins directory is. (Since plugins 
are DLLs, their original location isn't easily found by just searching 
where the program was executed from). This is seeming a tad unlikely, 
but I'm hoping that maybe something will appear.<br><br>-Registry! Registry! Registry!<br>The
 real fix is one which is already necessary for Grasshopper's future. 
Plugins will not need to know where they are stored; instead, they will 
find an entry in the registry containing the installation path for the 
program that is a part of them. (Eew... I suck at explaining this 
system).<br>This means that plugin programs can then be stored in more 
sane places such as Program Files. As a result, two browsers could then 
use the same Grasshopper plugin without having to install the entire 
thing twice.<br><br><br>I'm leaning towards the second solution, of course, but the first one may make a good fallback...<br><br>This means that the next Grasshopper version will actually be a big increment, featuring a fancy installer maker!<br><br><br>By the way, I am really sorry about how much of a mess this worklog is...

 A new side-project of mine (branching from some of the very early stuff
 in Equilibrium, described below with the nonsense title "Worklog 4") is
 going to build on my love for ridiculously open-ended 'finish it 
yourself' software with an adventurous concept admittedly inspired by 
something else. (What, Toribash? I've never heard of it! :p). It may 
even be a precursor to the previously mentioned open world simulation; 
perhaps going so far as to have a web plug-in mode.<br><br>I believe 
this project to be adventurous, because it goes beyond conventional game
 modifiability to the point where the entire game is built around mods 
that are seemlessly downloaded completely automatically and very 
quickly, in-game, from any game server.<br>I guess the complete 
modifiability makes it more like a game engine, but it is to be limited 
and simplified in such a way that developing for it is an easy task and 
the results still apply to a specific style. (Err... reasoning to be 
seen).<br><br><br>Open Arena<br><br>An open-ended online physics-based game with significant power given to the server.<br><br>The server manages the shape of the game world, player characters and more via run-time scripts.<br>The client manages physics code and general control rules as instructed to by the server.<br><br>Its open design will allow for unique looks, feels, and gameplay styles for each server such as:<br>-Toribash-inspired sparring simulation<br>-A full persistent battlefield<br>-Multiplayer or single-player physics puzzles (Single-player using a server built into the client program).<br><br>With
 content sent directly from the server to the client on the fly, servers
 must keep files rather small which justifies a Matrix-esque 
'practically empty world' style with a floor and various simple objects.<br>The menus and starting effects will follow this style, so presumably most unofficial servers will follow suit.<br><br>Load
 times will be kept at a minimum to compensate for the downloads 
required for each game, and the servers will send most world and object 
data with a scripting language such as (but much easier than) VRML, 
which again could reduce download times and ensure that the physics 
simulation works properly and (from the point of view of a server 
developer) automatically.<br><br>To avoid security issues and for the sake of cross-platform compatibility, run-time scripts are likely to be done via LUA.<br>The modelling language will also be done via LUA (or whatever other scripting language is used for run-time scripts).<br><br>While
 the physics simulation is to be a turn-based approach like that of 
Toribash, it is easy for a server to use a real-time system by setting 
frames per turn to 1 and turn selection time to 0. Keyboard controls 
could theoretically be created by having hot-keys control particular 
physics properties. Neither of these possibilities will be directly 
intended, though I will use them as a goal for the software's openness.<br><br>I
 hope that this software will present itself as a huge crossroads of 
worlds and possibilities, where every glance reveals a fresh idea and 
where anyone can bring their own visions to reality.<br><br><br>Now, why did I really post here?<br><a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Make-Chai-Tea" target="_blank">I learned how to make Chai Tea!</a> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Worklog #4</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-05-17)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> I guess I look a bit nutty using the worklogs so much...<br><br>Well, this is the project that starts tying it all together so those other ones will finally go away.<br><br>I
 am going to definietly be using a grown up APE as a level editor, and 
I'll hopefully be able to produce an easy email game interface thanks to
 the Grasshopper Web Plugin System.<br><br>This is actually a good thing
 to have all these different projects, since it means that I will not be
 inventing any new ones. There is enough variety here that I can switch 
between them when another one drives me crazy. (Though the different 
qualities of code is a bit infuriating. I may be rewiring APE again... 
depends on what happens with the plugin system, though).<br><br><br>About the game:<br><br>The
 game that I am working on makes sense only to myself. I hope that as I 
develop this worklog, my thoughts will organize themselves and it will 
begin to make sense in a way that anyone can understand.<br><br>The idea
 is to create a 3d strategy game entirely based around physics, in which
 all 3 planes of movement are important to the gameplay.<br><br>The 
underlying concept for the game is simple: Players place markers on the 
board to capture territory. Markers can only be placed if nearby to the 
area of influence of another marker. Like Go, a marker becomes useless 
when surrounded by your opponent's markers, making it necessary to 
create chains for better chance of survival.<br>A marker's area of 
influence is quite large; I have always been interested in the freedom 
offered by Go, in which markers can be placed absolutely anywhere on the
 board.<br><br>In this game, a board is a platform floating in midair...
 usually a flat, slightly rounded object, but occasionally boards will 
have different shapes.<br>A scene will consist of many of these boards placed in varied locations.<br>Boards
 are tilted by markers, which are actually quite heavy objects. Other 
special objects, such as propellers, can also be activated or placed to 
manipulate boards. (Also cannons and the like, but I'll deal with 
pyrotechnics and idiotic details later on).<br>A board in complete 
posession of a player offers many tactical and defensive advantages: The
 player can now place his markers anywhere on that board, the board can 
be moved about along the x or z axis in a way similar to 3d chess 
(except slightly more cool), and other positive effects which go beyond 
the depths of this introduction will also occur.<br><br>With all these elements in place, the game becomes a game about balance -- about managing the universe.<br>The
 player has to conquer the universe (reasoning for that is actually 
sound this time, by the way), but he must do this without destroying it 
and himself. (Now, wouldn't that be embarassing!)<br><br><br>Of course, there's a lot more than this.<br>So much that I, for once, can't be bothered to write about it.<br>All will become clear when it gets further finished...<br><br><br><br>On to technical stuff:<br><br>My
 previous fiddling with the Tokamak Physics Engine to get the game up 
and running has encountered hard times. Convex hulls in Tokamak are 
poorly implemented, and misbehave when objects are stacked on them. I 
was also unhappy with some stuttering effects which I had been 
encountering, and the difficulty that arose when attempting to add the 
ability for platforms to sink.<br>Unfortunately, I need convex hulls because of the varied (but convex) shapes of boards.<br>Since
 this game, being a strategy game, requires that I have VERY stable and 
reliable physics, I have switched to the Newton Dynamics Engine.<br><br>This
 engine, like Tokamak, features convex hulls. It is also very reliable 
and does not hop around when faced with confusing problems to solve.<br>I am pleased with my choice so far. In fact, I believe this may be one of the best free physics engines available!<br><br>I
 will be moving the project to BlitzMax to avoid the pain of porting 
Newton myself, so it will be a while before things are up and running 
again since I have to hunt down a new 3d engine. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>How to fix Exporters!</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-05-11)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> I realized that my scripts system was totally stupid, and so I am now hoping to simplify things.<br><br>GUI / Variables settings for different configuration packages will be stored in human-readable scripts, as before.<br>I'll see about improving them, though...<br><br><br>The change is occuring in Exporters and other scripts which would probably occur in runtime.<br>Rather than solve how to get mathematics working in the scripting language, I am switching over to DLLs.<br>APE

Over 6 months, in fact.<br><br>Yep,
 I'm still here. That tippy platform physics game got me digging in 
APE's source code for my convex hull code, so I decided to work on stuff
 while I was at it.<br>I still need this program, anyway; it will make a fantastic level editor, I hope.<br><br><br><br>Reflecting
 my obsession with making this program into a totally open, scriptable 
editor, I am now removing the Surfaces object type.<br><br>It will be 
replaced with a more complex system in which scripts define Variable 
Sets; collections of variables which can be accessed by any number of 
other objects (thus being quite different from regular variables tacked 
onto objects).<br>These are the same Variables as used everywhere else, 
but they are able to coexist without getting in eachother's way since 
the seperate linked lists do not connect with eachother, thus achieving 
two chains of the same Type object.<br>Of course, we can also have more than one type of variable sets; we can have a surface set, a sound set... whatever :P<br>All will carry the pinkish icon.<br><br>The system should easily be robust enough for these variable sets to be used in a number of ways by the exporter scripts.<br>Since
 any object type can easily be iterated through, the exporter can just 
iterate through Variable Sets and decide what to call. It could be a 
command to create new type instances, set variables in an object, or 
even create a new Tokamak phyics engine surface as before.<br><br>A cool
 thing here is that some things which I originally expected to be 
requiring scripts to do is actually possible with the systems already in
 place. As an obvious example, object variables can be stored in 
Variable Sets, but be translated entirely into just variables being 
assigned to a single object in the final export. (Err... that made no 
sense).<br><br><br>Telling a variables script to have a variable that is
 actually a pointer to a variable set remains easy. (In fact, probably 
easier than before).<br><br><br>Now all I have left to fix up in the 
unification department is the funny selection modes... I wonder if I 
could throw in a 2d editor...<br>I guess the selection modes can be 
fixed up with object type scripts, as described below, where I could 
create 3d physics geometries through a script instead of hardcoding 
them.<br><br>Figuring out LUA is getting more and more tempting.<br><br><br>The
 added unification and abolishment of anything directly related to 
physics engines (that will be in the Physics Package, hopefully) has 
justified a name change, of course.<br>Maybe I'll think of a real name, 
for once? A few have crossed my mind... the most tempting one so far was
 quickly forgotten. It was pretty good, though. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>In other news...</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-04-02)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">

 I have performed many, many, many tests on PluginHostCtrl in an attempt
 to figure out what is going wrong with it when I call special functions
 from ghEmbedder.<br>I believe that the problem is as follows:<br>ghEmbedder.dll sends a window message, using WM_COPYDATA, to its parent window. (The window belonging to ghMain.dll).<br>Unlike
 Firefox, something in Internet Explorer is being rather picky here, and
 either PluginHostCtrl is using the WM_COPYDATA message as well and 
screws up when it recieves mine, PluginHostCTRL doesn't like recieving 
messages that don't belong to it, or something in the deep expanses of 
IE doesn't like my WM_COPYDATA messages.<br>Either way, the message is 
definietly never going to the right place, which means that the crash is
 occuring in something's window message handler. Presumably, Firefox 
sends messages destined for plugins downwards to the plugin, while IE 
steals them. (Hmm... Parents taking advantage of their Children?).<br><br>Okay, that's all good. I could probably fix it, right?!<br>The problem? I have no idea where, physically, the message handler actually is!<br>(Why can't all programs just be the same?)<br><br>So...
 the first thing I am going to do is explore other, equally comfortable 
ways to communicate between two processes and see if IE panics with 
them. I may be able to just stick to the same technique, but send window
 messages to a hidden window that Internet Explorer doesn't know about. 
This will be a bit tricky, because the window will have to be nicely 
obscured so that IE has no idea that it exists, but it shouldn't 
negatively affect the speed of anything.<br>If that doesn't work, I will
 make a few more hopeless attempts to make PluginHostCtrl behave 
(assuming that it is the source of my problems, which it probably is).<br>If <i>that</i>
 doesn't work, I'll finish these nice features for NP-API browsers, turn
 them off when running under PluginHostCtrl, release the update, release
 the source, and hope that some other genius fixes the problem for the 
good of humanity.<br><br><br><br><br>There is one good thing to come of 
this. In the next IE vs. Firefox argument, I can explain that I hate IE 
because it cost me 6 weeks of my life.<br><br><br>6:00pm<br>Okay, I was wrong :(<br>It
 turns out now that the messaging system is not at fault... which is 
good and bad. Bad, because now I have absolutely no idea where in this 
infernal source code the problem could possibly be (it's not where it 
should be!), and good because I can stick with the same messaging 
system. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Stability at last</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-01-16)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> The previous problem, sadly, (and fortunately), was not Messenger's fault.

 that, since these features would be slightly more... uhm... 
competitive... than the other stuff, I will be perhaps looking at a 
"Donate Now and Recieve" type thing, or actually going for a payed-for 
code library.<br><br>Thankfully, Grasshopper's nature would make it 
quite interesting as a paid-for thing. I could release the entire 
general plugin stuff would be free software, with the ability to 
communicate with ghEmbedder.dll. The only thing that has to actually be 
bought then is the ghEmbedder.dll that can use this communication 
system.<br><br>Of course, this will only happen if I am certain that I have done a perfect job, though. It gives me the shivers when I release <i>free</i> software that isn't perfect.

testing a new option for ghDownload, which is AutoEmbed. This option

your program itself, instead of making you do it.<br>I'm also looking at
 moving ghDownload straight to C++, but this may be a bad idea. (Not 
that I think C++ is less powerful, but because I know that I am less

 take measures to avoid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_hell" target="_blank">screwing things up.</a> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Documentation is done!</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2005-12-22)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> The documentation is finished!<br>There
 are a few horrible parts, so I will keep this here for a while before I
 release. I also need to sort out web browser compatibility in my 
documentation. To put it simply, the docs are not idiot-proof. I may 
just release them as-is, though, and watch people suffer in the hopes 
that they will contribute meaningful, useful input into how better to 
explain things because I'm really bad at explanations. I tried to fix 
how I tend to explain things incomprehensibly by adding a "how it works"
 section so that people have a better idea of my constantly changing 
lingo, but I don't think it help quite enough. Since it's free and open 
source software, though, and I dont have a "donate" button anywhere, I 
don't think it would be much to ask for a few people to help me with 
documentation.<br><br>There is also still an easy to fix error in ghEmbedder.dll...<br><br><br>The the mean time, I just built the web page:<br><a href="http://crumbsoftware.f2o.org/index.php?p=products/grasshopper/" target="_blank">http://crumbsoftware.f2o.org/index.php?p=products/grasshopper/</a><br>The news is all lies... that was just for a test of my updater.<br><br>That's
 the first time I have actually used my web site's PHP stuff that I made
 a while ago to create a new section, and it was miraculously easy!<br><br><br>I
 added an Internet updater and news viewer to the main program... very 
fun to get stuff like that working. The process of checking for an 
update is rather simplistic, but I think it works fine. It just 
downloads the 3 byte verinfo file from the web site, and if it has a 
bigger number then it needs to update. It's not nearly as annoying as 
various others, because it neither forces you to update nor pesters you 
with an annoying popup message saying "Hey, look at me! I was released 
as an unfinished product so they had to FIX ME AFTER!" In fact, it's 
completely up to the user to even check for an update!<br><br>The rest 
of the updater is also pretty neat. Theoretically, I could put every 
single program file onto my web space, make note of them in the program,
 and then if the executable was moved to a blank directory it would be 
able to sort itself out and reinstall every single other missing file 
with absolutely no user interaction beyond hitting "Download All Missing
 Files."<br><br>Of course, that functionality isn't entirely in here, as
 it's just used to download external tools whose licenses required me to
 download directly from their web site... but I may put it somewhere 
else eventually. A self-repairing installation seems like an extremely 
useful thing to have.<br><br><br>Another cool thing: It is possible to 
download two, three, or even more files at once. It simply pauses the 
other download until the new one finishes. The reason why that is so 
cool is because I didn't have to do anything for it -- it just happened.
 I love that.<br><br>Very cool stuff.<br><br><br><br>After this project,
 I am going to return to APE, but I'll also be working on a game, 
currently titled "The Orb Game." I won't say much more beyond that, 
other than that 95% of it is completely unique. And when I say 
completely, I don't mean like the war under the sea game being 
completely unique because it's under the sea. This is unique.<br><br>Anyway, back the Grasshopper Web Plugin System...<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>I didn't lie, because it's not my fault.</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2005-12-21)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Excellent news on the recent problems with the plugin failing to initialize.<br>After
 a lot of random fiddling, I have learned that the problems with the dll
 modification operation are that the tools which I am using are 
counteracting eathother. (The resource editor appears to kill the 
useability of the DLL, while the Hex editor appears to destroy... or 
maybe damage... resource information). Since there is no way that these 
programs would do this normally, this must be my fault. Maybe they don't
 like DLLs.<br><br>The end result for any editing (even done manually), 
seems to be that the DLL no longer runs at all. The resource file on it 
is still found by web browsers, which is weird. This is a setback, but 
hopefully not too much. If worse comes to worse, I'll use a c++ compiler
 to recompile the DLL.<br><br>Thankfully, I have a very cool, 
idiot-proof, missing file replacing, tools system... I hope to turn it 
into a sort of an easy to use installer framework over time... and some 
nice script files that I can edit in notepad without touching real code.
 Modular software is fun.<br><br>...<br>Now to read over some help files.<br><br>Whatever
 the problem is, I'm hoping to be able to fix it all in one single move.
 Maybe I will change the DLL to find out what file to execute through 
its resource script.<br><br><br><br><br>In a recent revelation, I have 
made ghEmbedder completely seperate from Grasshopper's main browser-end 
DLL. This is useful, because it means that it can be used for performing
 the (admittedly simple) operation on anything. Both DLLs weigh in at 
about 60KB each. It is also useful because it means far less fiddling 
for everyone.<br><br><br><br>2:15 PM<br>Problem solved! I set the 
FileToExecute string to have a size of _MAX_PATH (thus less potential of
 messing up when altered externally), and then changed it from a 
constant to extern. I have no idea what that did other than what I 
learned from a quick peek at the Visual Studio documentation, but I'm 
sure that whatever it was didn't break anything.<br><br>I also changed my hex editor script to not use replaceall by the command line as the method to change the filepath. This works.<br><br><br>Now I just have to sort out window positioning and my tutorial on the writing of an installer.<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>It's done... almost</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2005-12-19)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> 3 entries in one day, and a fourth to come soon.<br>Maybe I shouldn't have started this worklog.

 after I fix everything else, I seem to have broken the pluginbase 
dll... It looks like this is something gone wrong on the C++ end of 
things. The plugin is simply not initializing - no error message or 
anything, though. I'm still aiming for a short release.<br>It looks as

 you may have noticed that Grasshopper did not come out 4 days ago like I
 said. The reason for that is because I have gone through many frantic 
revisions of the documentation in a hopeless attempt to make this thing 
more user friendly.<br><br>Then I realized: It would be easier to just 
finish the next version, which pops the whole thing into a single DLL, 
than to write the documentation for this version. So, version 0.2 will 
not be released, but 0.3 will. Hopefully soon... Developement here is 
quite slow because a single test requires that I compile a DLL, write a 
selfembedder, plug the DLL into that selfembedder, and then run it all 
through a web browser.<br><br><br>So, what does it all do?<br>Grasshopper
 gives you the ability to easily produce advanced, highly customizable, 
web browser plugins which are executed automatically, whenever needed, 
directly within a web browser. Its unique behaviour opens up a myriad of
 possibilities; audio playback, 3d file format viewing, image viewers, 
PDF viewers... etc.<br>Grasshopper is different from other tools like 
it, because it allows for you to set your own MIME types/file extension 
settings for your plugins, it is free, and it has room for future 
extensions to recieve functions from a JavaScript on a web page.<br><br><br>This is a screenshot of the main Grasshopper executable... doing... just about everything it does:<br><img src="7206&amp;log=1272_files/img2.jpg"><br>It
 does very believeable fake multithreading - that embedded app tester is
 running at the precise same time as the external tool downloader, the 
downloader's web browser, and the plugin creator (though nobody notices 
that one because it's a practically instant process).<br>The entire 
program is powered by plain Blitz3d with WinBlitz and a single external 
DLL for embedding Internet Explorer. I'm quite pleased with it.<br><br><br><br>So far, for the DLL support, I have encountered a bit of progress and a bit of bother.<br>For the progress part: I actually figured out how to write a Blitz-compatible DLL :)<br>It's
 turned out to be quite easy. So far, the DLL will embed the Blitz 
runtime window within a requested parent window and then it goes on to 
make a failed attempt at repositioning it and changing its window 
styles.<br>The bother: When Blitz accesses the DLL, it will be probably 
be a totally different instance than the one accessed by the web 
browser, so I will need to figure out some clever way to communicate 
between the web browser instance of the DLL and the Blitz program, while
 using the Blitz program's instance of the DLL to do stuff.<br>I may be completely wrong, though.<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Camera controls</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2005-10-17)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> I had fun today with tweeking the control scheme.<br>APE is now the first program I have ever used which features super camera tilting powers!<br><br>It

A very good day, in fact.<br><br>Behold, the box!<br>I
 haven't said much about advanced stuff like water lately. No worries 
though, I just had to sort out how it will work under the new interface.
 The user will be able to create dummy objects (boxes, usually), to 
which can be assigned all sorts of variables, such as if it is physics 
engine water (which could be dealt with properly by an exporter for a 
physics engine such as Meqon, for instance).<br>These dummy objects will
 have different creation methods, as determined by yet another script 
file. When they come about, there will be a great deal of turmoil as I 
put geometries into the system. All will go in place of where the 
geometry editor currently is, with the simple addition of a single 
dropdown selection box.<br><br><br>I have nearly finished writing the 
docs for the variables scripts system to the extent that they will act 
as a guideline for myself. Once again, I feel comfortable, because 
finally I, too, hate writing docs.<br><br><br>Now, why was today in particular a good day?<br>I have completed the interpreter for the variables scripts system.<br>It's always a great feeling when code just pops together mechanically with minimal effort -- as though it programmed itself.<br>That
 happened here. My script interpreter was finished much more quickly 
than expected because every variables list for every object is treated 
the exact same. The template vars lists, after being read from the 
variable scripts, are saved to an array of types. That is when I was 
really amazed. I thought I still had loads of work ahead, but, in fact, 
all that needs to be done to assign a list to an object is to duplicate 
the variables connected to the template chain into the actual object's 
variables chain. Wonderfully perfectly easy. Not to mention, quite fast!
 It's also a great feeling when I can talk about my code and it sounds 
like a foreign language to everyone but me. A fine sense of completion. I
 can now safely say that APE is half finished!<br>I will never doubt open-ended programming again!<br><br>Still
 have a bit of work to do, such as combo box selections for variables in
 the scripts, and the automatic variables, and other stuff... but that's
 all relatively straight-forward. After that comes the new geometry 
editor.<br><br>Oh, and I should have done this one earlier:<br><img src="7206&amp;log=1272_files/Heirarchy.jpg"><br>This
 is the structure of the different objects in my program. I did this 
after I realized that I was referring to entities as objects and objects
 as entities. Don't ask why entities are called entities and not meshes.
 Ever.<br>The answer to that question may come five years after version 1.<br><br><br>A
 test version of the program may appear once I have the variables 
scripts complete. It will not be an operable program, but it will be 
useful to have people (hopefully) playing with the scripting language, 
thus uncovering any bugs which I would not have found because I go too 
easy on my interpreter :)<br><br><br><br>Oh, and a bit of bad/good news.
 I was reminded today that people usually need to take breaks from 
projects... I think I'm one of them. I am going to tweak APE a bit more 
so that I can get back into it easily when I return in a while, and I am
 going to work on two other projects: SW3d (a program that I have a log 
for and which may become an important part of APE, among other things), 
and "The Orb Game" (a proper working title), which I have mentioned a 
few times... I have to start it up soon because I'm already designing

 also gave the program a more uniform feel by adding a heirarchy into 
the Objects treeview, in which the user can quickly bring up and modify 
Scenes, Groups, Meshes, Surfaces, and even Geometries! Along with this 
nice tree system, I did some beautifying with my first ever image strip,
 which is clearly visible as the only bit of colour in the image. It 
turned out somewhat like the look that Google uses, which is good.<br><br>-The side bar is now on the left, because when it was on the right, I had to reposition it whenever the window was resized.<br><br>-I
 decided to use the default font for text boxes, even though, for me, it
 is big and bold. This was probably the right decision.<br><br>-The 
positions window is no longer in the sidebar, which means that the 
program will be useable at a lower screen resolution. The GUI was also 
cleverly designed so that I could, at any time, decide to make any of 
those other windows floating as well. I would be very grateful if 
someone gave me code to do dockable and undockable windows with WinBlitz
 :)<br><br>-The variables system is <i>Finished</i>! Now, to make it 
fully operational, I actually have to create the variables part of the 
interfaces system in order to make it all work perfectly. The system 
allows for variables, which are stored in linked lists, to be assigned 
to anything. Since it is rather useful, I was careful to make the 
variables module easy to integrate into other projects. There is a tiny 
bit that simply needs to be removed, which is part of the program's GUI.
 (I think the GUI has become the most common topic in this worklog...).<br><br>-I have managed to stop the close button from closing the window. Believe it or not, this is progress!<br><br>-I now have surfaces working again -- And better than ever! (Thanks to the variables system)<br><br>-Geometry
 creation and selection mode changing is back in. Currently can only 
create boxes, because I haven't yet created the geometry creation 
window. The geometry creation interface will recieve a bit of fiddling 
anyways. Basically, geometries are created as before but can also have 
their shape and size changed at any time (even by using the selected 
faces).<br><br>-I have a working right-click menu in the Objects list. (Thanks for the help, WinBlitz guy!).<br><br>-Objects can be deleted via the Objects list.

PHP. This also means that the APE section is fully operational. A forum 
section has also been set up for the program, and its purpose will 
become clear with the next release.<br>While writing this log I added a totally awesome random logo thingy. I have two logo designs, and 6 colours for each one :) <a href="http://crumbsoftware.f2o.org/" target="_blank">http://crumbsoftware.f2o.org/</a><br>The

 some ways, once all the problems are cleared up, because features seem 
to suddenly appear out of nowhere.<br>After that, it's back to the exporters and interface scipts...<br><br>I

 having so much fun with the exporter scripts (now featuring very basic 
If statements), that I am going to also start work on interface files. 
Interfaces will allow for people to more easily customize the naming of 
various parts of the program, and the existence/nonexistence of certain 
things, to better suit particular physics engines. Interfaces will also 
feature a simple and yet very flexible variable system (like every 
respectable level building application has), through which attributes 
like Mass and Handle are set, as well as any other custom variables 
(including, obviously the ability to have totally non-physics related 
variables assigned on a per-entity basis). The variable system will 
later be well aware of when Blitz types are used for variables, and 
attempt (but only if it will succeed every time) to ensure that all 
Types work properly on export.<br><br>Along with the much-needed variable system and (later) interfaces, will be a total GUI overhaul. <br>Why

the entity properties menu would be horribly out of place and 
inconsistent if things were more efficiently and uniformly organized in 
the entity variable list.<br>I will likely decide on a sidebar GUI.

not be until the auto-resize-to-rotation function is done (though it 
shouldn't take too much longer).<br><br><br><br>Complications have

 I just realised that with a large flow of other ideas for things that I
 must do (including my entry for the 2005 Coder's Workshop Water 
Competition (which thankfully will use physics)), which make my pitiful 
release date estimations even less accurate than they were, I am going 
to release the rigid body editor for APOE in a seperate package 
extremely soon. It will export to .bb code, and it will be very simple. 
Simply a faster way to set up rb objects for tokamak one by one, with a 
windows select file window. Exactly how the program first began and was 
intended to be before it went out of hand. It will also have a happy and
 easy file format for other physics engines... Or maybe just that and no
 .bb export...<br>Then with a bit of pressure relieved, I will gradually
 finish off the big program which is still going to be made for my own 
sake as well as everyone else's (because we still need joints and ropes 
and fun stuff like that).<br><br>The APOE structure is also due for an 
overhaul soon. I have decided to split the program into two levels of 
operation. One way to run it would be on a per-object basis, or for 
groups of objects (to allow for joints to still be set up), and there 
would also be the method which would have everything arranged into a 
scene (which is a method that many people would not want to have to use 
in many cases).<br><br>The RB editor will be updated as I build on APOE 
itself - meaning that it will be given object groups and joints and 
ropes before APOE is done.<br><br>With that in mind, the release date 
for APOE is now "when it's done". The release date for the Rigid Body 
Editor is my usual 2 weeks, because I still need to build a quick .bb 
exporter, and single out the rb editor from the rest of the program, and
 iron out a problem, and drink tea.<br><br><br><br><br><br>PS: If you 
ever happen to come across the guy who had the bright idea to put 
capsules in a physics engine - please kill him for me.<br><br>PPS: 2 
weeks is an estimation. You may be aware that I always say two weeks. It
 just means "Soon, I think, assuming it all works." In this case, 
everything is working. I'm spending a bit of time streamlining my code a
 bit more.<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Further Puttering</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2005-01-01)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> ---Sunday, Jan 23, 2005---<br>Just
 to prove I'm still working, I have suddenly and mysteriously built 1000

own code :D I just felt like saying that, it feels special! This is my 
first ever program exceeding 1000 lines.<br><br>---Wednesday Jan 12, 2005---<br>Sad
 news. The release date of mid-January was set assuming that nobody 
dies, and nobody breaks both arms after slipping on ice. Sadly, both of 
those things happened. I would have tried to get it done this weekend, 
but I'm gone then, so it can't be worked on until the week after 
(thankfully, I have a good deal of time to work on this from Monday to 
the end of January).<br><br>Features not in release 1:<br>Ragdoll Specific Editor<br>Plugins<br>Wizards<br>Advanced object editor (except for ropes, which will be in)<br>No fix for flat convex hull crash - just don't be dumb (you'll see)<br><br>*List may be updated* (but I hope not)<br><br>---Original---<br>Object
 transformations are in at last. Scaling of objects via the movement 
arrows is currently inoperative, and I doubt that it will ever operate 
smoothly. The position window, however, does scaling just fine - and 
it's better to use it anyways. For movement and rotations using that 
window, the program will decide whether the number is floating point or 
an integer, so if you make all your object positions square on without 
decimals, it will actually be worthwhile.<br>Of course, both windows still work fine for rotation and movement of objects.<br><br>I
 have finally got enough windows available to open that I can almost do 
one of those silly screenshots in which every single window in the 
program is visible.<br><br>Free flight camera mode is in, making it easier to see what you are doing.<br><br>Object
 groups can pop in at any time because throughout the construction of 
the program, I have always treated my code as though they already 
existed. They will probably exist within the next few days.<br><br>Ropes
 are oddly enough, not added yet. Neither are joints or scene 
properties. Those are all coming soon in that order. When that happens, 
you will see a misleading and hard to understand screenshot of every 
window in the program open and at their most busy looking settings.<br><br><br>Also,
 I'm going to try something that seems like a fairly good idea and worth
 trying out. I am going to release a beta of the program with no saving,
 loading, or in fact any file format even planned. With that release, I 
will stay very open to any feature requests (and, of course, bug 
reports). Because there would be no file format to worry about 
accidentally bothering, I will be able to make room for the features 
without too much hastle, and no worries regarding backwards 
compatibility.<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>The Release Draws Nearer</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2004-11-14)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> ---Saturday, November 27, 2004---<br>Okay,

 After much fiddling, I have rescued my program from a horrible plague 
of errors, and the Object Library is now done, with lots of fun 
functionality.<br>Basically, now a mesh is imported, you can set various
 default settings like geometries and mass, etc. Then any number (Up to 
1024 I think) of entities using that mesh can be added to the scene. 
It's simple, but it took me forever because I had to do a lot of

taking a short(ish) break in which I will take care of other unfinised

 with a car demo in ODE somehow led me to a decision that the loader 
will work in a much more open way, which forces the programmer to do a 
lot of the work (and removes the one line loading), but for good reason.
 Faked effects should still be able to work. I will also maybe write 
quick loaders for various engines and languages so the person doesn't 
have to. There is definietly very good reasoning for this, mostly based 
on my own inevitable laziness. Here is an idea of how the loader would 
work in blitz:<br><pre class="code">;APOE loader concept 0.1

world = LoadScene("Tokamak","Scene.apoe")

For i = 0 To GetSceneRBCount(world)

	rb = TOKRB_Create()
	TOKRB_SetMass rb,GetMass_RB(i)
	TOKRB_SetPosition rb,getX_RB(i),getY_RB(i),getZ_RB(i)
	TOKRB_SetRotation rb,getPitch_RB(i),getYaw_RB(i),getRoll_RB(i)
	;list of all possible rb specific commands goes here. 
	;A bit fiddly, but it only needs to be done once

	For g = 0 To getGeomCountRB()
	
		;all RB settings
	
	Next

;Similar method for joints and everything else
</pre><br>So basically it is done by retrieving bits of information from the dll, which simply reads the file and arranges everything.<br>If I get adventurous, maybe I will set up automatic object grouping so that there are no needless function calls.<br><br>---Original---<br><br>Not great progress, but I'm happy today because it's the first progress in a month.<br>I
 have merged my code from my old hard drive (hard drive crashed, went to
 data recovery) and my new hard drive (bought it so computer would run 
during data recovery) and I have it going nicely. I now have nicer code 
structure in some bits, a completely working surface library, and the 
advanced object creator's framework is in. Soon (after I add in some 
pretty gfx and arrange the dropdown menus properly) I will put in rope 
creation (though it seems like it may get fiddly, so expect delays). In 
terms of gfx addins, there will be little icons all over the place, and 
in the surfaces library there is an icon that's actually of use to 
visualise the friction on a surface with a normal map (I for one, have 
trouble with avoiding setting friction to 100%).<br>Also found someone 
who may be willing to do some dll programming (the loader for apoe 
exports will be in a dll, along with various functions to make physics 
easier both for me and for you).<br><br>So, APOE is back for those that noticed it being gone.<br>Felt like posting this because worklogs are cool. Real news to come.

object physical attributes window is in the works, so that objects can 
be edited in a more friendly way and the windows will be smaller, better
 organised, and more attractive overall.<br><br>And the important bit: 
I'm going to bite the bullet and learn C or something so that the 
program will come packed with a dll containing all the handy time-saving
 functions required to make physics programming easy no matter what 
engine you use. This would include an APOE loader, rope editing 
functions, and a physics updater that works for buoyancy and other 
special options.<br>My reason for this decision is that I've realised 
that the only people who want this will be people who know how to code, 
and if they are using a physics engine, then they probably know mostly 
how to use it without my aid. Besides, most people don't want a whole 
individual program for their physics scene, and end up copying and 
pasting everything that is important out of it.<br><br>Also a decision: V
 1 of APOE will only have support for Tokamak and Newton, but it will 
gain more as time goes on. I will also add a feature in the prefs menu 
so that you could tell APOE about a physics engine you want it to 
support, which would basically involving choosing which features it 
supports, writing out functions and required variables, and then APOE 
would determine a system for itself to work with to write the proper 
scripts.<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Feature list</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2004-07-05)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">

 Convex hulls are in, and the UI looks nicer, and the scene editor and 
object editor are succesfully seperated into different sections. I will 
next be adding an object library, and then some new features that give 
the ability to merge a jointed body cloth physics sim into a rigid body 
object using ropes (something that would be extremely complicated to do 
with code). Later along the lines is a faked buoyancy setup (okay, I'm

 I have mentioned in my description, it is my first large project in

 be able to generate a tokamak rigid body for a 3d model almost 
perfectly, by simply selecting faces (actually vertices, but the user 
would probably prefer to select faces) on a 3d model. Tokamatizer will 
then figure out the rotations and sizing of the new block. It will also
