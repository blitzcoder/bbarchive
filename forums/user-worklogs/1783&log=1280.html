 Unfortunately I can't vouch for the ongoing status of the ALSA 
extensions.  I've made them available to BRL for inclusion, so I guess 
we'll wait for a Syncmods to see if they make it in there.<br><br>The 
response for testing has been disappointing to say the least.  While 
nobody complained of it not working, nobody complained of it not working
 either :P  Basically not enough of you guys tested it out for me.<br><br>As
 for packaging, I have a .spec file to build an RPM, and Debs are 
relatively easy to make too.  The problem however is that BlitzMax 
requires the user to have permissions to be able to update modules, etc.
 which they won't do for something that generally must be installed as 
root.  <br><br>While I can include scripts to modify permissions so 
everyone can access BlitzMax's folders, this isn't exactly in the spirit
 of Linux permissions and directories.  Generally stuff within the /usr 
or /opt folders shouldn't be changed by a regular user.  All the stuff 
like compiling modules should happen in the user's home, possibly in a 
nice .BlitzMax folder.<br><br>I'm waiting on the release of the source 
to the Blitz IDE and compilation tools to see whether this is a viable 
option - theoretically it's just a matter of pointing everything in the 
right locations...<br><br>This won't affect packaging for your games of 
course.  You can still write packages for games, just make sure that any
 editable files are written to your user's home directory.<br><br>For now though I'm going to concentrate on actually writing a game in BlitzMax.<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Freeaudio ALSA and OSS</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2005-08-19)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> This weekend I intend to finish up the Freeaudio code modifications for ALSA and OSS.<br><br>I
 actually wrote some code to support aRts while helping out with the 
Linspire issues, but after the hassles to get it to compile 
(library/include issues) I'd rather leave the other sound systems out 
for now.<br><br>I believe that with ALSA I have all the latency issues 
sorted out - if there are any latency problems these are due to your own
 ALSA settings - because OSS goes through ALSA now, they will also most 
likely affect OSS.  You should check your frame count settings as the 
ALSA libraries will try to use the lowest frame count available.<br><br>My intention is to check for ALSA, and if ALSA cannot be initialised, try OSS.<br><br>I
 also have the basic .spec file for a BlitzMax RPM.  Once finished, 
Blitz Research should simply be able to rpmbuild on the .spec file and 
provide an RPM with only minor modifications.  The RPM should also be 
cross-distro compatible.<br><br>I am probably going to work with Dan on the Deb files too.<br><br>Once
 these things are finished I'll be continuing to work on improving the 
Linux port of Max and probably improving general BlitzMax Audio.<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Beautiful music</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2005-08-13)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Surprisingly it didn't take that long to get ALSA playing the same as 
OSS.  It just required some tweaking of the buffers and frames/periods.<br><br>Everything seems to work perfectly too, although I'm a little concerned with latency.<br><br>I think at this stage there might be a slight bit more latency with ALSA than with OSS, but I can't tell for sure.<br><br>I
 really need people to test it out, so I've created a compiled version 
of Rockout and tarred it up, which you can download here: <a href="http://www.teamted.net/rockout.tar.gz" target="_blank">http://www.teamted.net/rockout.tar.gz</a>  You'll need to extract it to your BlitzMax samples/hitoro folder as I've not included the media.<br><br>Please email me with any questions or issues.  If it runs OK, make sure to compare it with the OSS executables for latency.<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>First steps with ALSA</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2005-08-12)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 I've taken the existing freeaudio.cpp file from the Pub mods, and 
modified the Linux code in there now (using OSS) to use ALSA's PCM 
support instead. <br><br>It was a pretty rough job, essentially just 
replacing the ioctl, open and write calls with their ALSA equivalents.  I
 haven't really looked into how the buffers/frames and threading are 
working, which is already causing some issues.<br><br>At this stage it 
does a pretty bad job of playing back audio - you can hear the sounds 
but they're playing at the wrong speed and a bit distorted.  The actual 
code itself is stable however - no weird crashes or memory leaks are 
apparent.<br><br>Obviously the first thing I will be trying to do is fix
 the actual playback, so we get something that sounds the same and has 
similar or better latency to the OSS code.  Otherwise I'd like to find a
 way for it to co-exist with the OSS code, so using ALSA or OSS is at 
least a matter of preference.<br><br>Once this is done I will be asking for as many people as possible to help test the code.<br><br>Apart
 from hopefully getting ALSA support into the Freeaudio mod I may try to
 write another module which adds some additional sound features to the 
Linux port, such as sound capture.  Hopefully this will encourage some 
other people to spend some time on expanding audio support for the other
 platforms too.<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Blitz Z-Machine port (Infocom Intepreter)</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2002-09-13)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Sorry, been a bit sluggish with the link, I've actually had it ready for about a week.<br><br>So without any further ado, here's the <a href="http://members.xoom.virgilio.it/uncleted/" target="_blank">download page</a>.<br><br>I should perhaps also point out that it DOES include the full source code.<br><br>Enjoy.<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Blitz Z-Machine port (Infocom Intepreter)</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2002-08-28)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 After spending about 10 hours walking through Inform assembly listings 
(and considering ditching the whole thing), I finally squashed a few 
bugs, including one very annoying off-by-one bug, which I blame the docs
 for :P  Now we're getting somewhere.  I've actually had input going for
 the last day or so, but bugs made it pretty useless... not anymore.<br><br>I
 can interact with Zork I, ie. look at the mailbox, open it, read the 
leaflet, go north, etc. and I've got a playable amount of the op-codes 
supported and tested.  <br><br>There are still a few things to go for 
getting Z-Code versions 1 through 3 (majority of Infocom games are 
version 3 apparently) fully supported, saving and loading games and undo
 support, and then there's the whole interface/text handling/layout 
stuff.  Not to mention the whole load of bugs I've probably still yet to
 squash.<br><br>Anyway, I must admit to being pretty pleased with 
progress so far.  Hopefully I'll have a cleaned up test version with a 
download available soon...<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Blitz Z-Machine port (Infocom Intepreter)</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2002-08-25)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> The missus slept in for a bit, so I fixed up a few things, resulting in this:<br><br><pre class="code">PRINT :ZORK: The Great Underground Empire - Part I

</pre><br>OK, so you can gather my ZString/ZChar conversion isn't 
working right, but that should be enough to show some of the progress so
 far with actually running the ZMachine and interpreting OP-Codes, shown
 here as Inform(-ish) Assembly language.<br><br>I can tell you that the 
source code base has grown since the last update, from 6k up to around 
43k at this point.  The addition comes from implementing and handling 
some Op-Codes (21 of about 120), and much of the Object handling code, 
which is probably the nastiest part of the ZMachine.  I've also done my 
best to support all versions of Z-Machine (1-8) available according to 
the Standard 1.0 document, which fattens the code up a bit in places.<br><br>At
 this stage, there are maybe two bugs I'm aware of that need to be 
sorted out, one is the ZString handling, and the other is possibly 
byte-array address translation, which as far as I can tell is causing 
some Ops to write illegal ZMachine addresses.<br><br>Other than those, 
the major thing remaining for Zork I to run nicely is primarily Input 
Op-Codes, which I haven't even looked at yet.  Hopefully, other than 
that, it's not too difficult from here on.<br><br>I'll be pretty busy for a few days, so the next update might take a bit longer.<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Blitz Z-Machine port</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2002-08-19)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Encouraged by some recent posts on the forums, I'm putting aside my 3D 
Adventure/RPG engine for the moment to figure out some Z-Machine 
emulation stuff under Blitz.  Don't go getting any hopes up yet, it's 
not an altogether straightforward thing, even with some of the 
documentation I have; which feels like it has been translated from 
English to Japanese and back again, although I suspect that's something 
to do with my feeble mind.<br><br>At any rate I have some stuff going at
 the moment, I'm parsing through the header files, I've figured out 
Z-strings, using banks for memory emulation, decoded the dictionary, and
 I've just about got the routine/op-code calling stuff.  There are quite
 a number of different op-codes to be implemented, thankfully the 
documentation seems pretty thorough in this respect.<br><br>The main 
intention here is to get at least Zork I (Infocom Version 2) working, 
and then maybe look into later releases if I feel inclined.  It's 
primarily an academic experiment, as such I will probably be making the 
source available to share my confusion with you all.<br><br>Actually 
reading up on the Z-Machine has left me pretty impressed with the whole 
thing, specced out over 20 years ago, with some very clever tricks to 
work within the limitations of computers at the time, as well as remain 
portable to the number of systems available back then (as opposed to the
 almost PC/Windows only world we live in now.)<br><br>Anyway, the next 
step is to hopefully get enough op-codes working to get the initial Zork
 text up on screen, at which point I'll probably post another log here.<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
