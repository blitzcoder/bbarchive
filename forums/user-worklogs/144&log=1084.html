 Gah! Tis done at last. I've uploaded it now and all I need to do is jot
 off a quick webpage. Probably shouldn't take more than a zillion years.

I also drew a few background tiles and stuck them on<br>every damn screen in the game (that was fun :P ) and added some lovely<br>secret stuff to the game as well (which wasn't as much as I'd liked but I<br>ran out of ideas as well as room). Did a few more sound effects (the swoosh<br>on the screen-wipe and the end of level lifts) and pretty much finished up.<br>The only thing left to do now is the end of game sequence, which'll<br>probably give hints for the cheat codes (which'll probably be really difficult<br>to find by doing an ascii search of the binary because they're stored in a<br>really odd manner) and a few more sound effects (for piffling things that I<br>may well say "Sod it" about). Oh, also had to rewrite the display routine a<br>little to allow for the inclusion of backgrounds as destroying blocks was<br>causing it to cut chunks out of the display. Whoops. What the hell am I gonna'<br>do for an ending effect?!<br><br>V0.991 - Wow, now we're splitting numbers too small. Really shouldn't have<br>jumped from .94 to .99 so eagerly. Anyhow, I've put in expansion pack support<br>now so that if anyone is stupid enough to create a map-pack they can do so<br>and it'll be recognised by the game. I may well tart up the editor now and<br>include it with the release. Then again, I may keep it separate. I'm just that<br>contrary. Also stuck in the extra keys for Neil Walker because he's a big<br>girl's blouse. A pink one, too. I really should update to the latest version<br>of Lee Page's pak routines... Might even alter the version numbers - I've<br>always been fond of revisionist history. ;)<br>Oh, I also changed it so that the extra level wasn't a secret any more but<br>part of the main game (ie, there are 5 levels to travel through instead of<br>the original 4). Hopefully RH and JB'll come through with extra maps for me<br>so we can make this an even bigger release. I'd love to have 8 in there in<br>the end.<br><br>V0.992 - Well, I did a lot of coding for the ending sequence, the code is<br>a bloody mess (staggeringly bad - I mean it) but I quite like the effect. In<br>particular the parallax working in two dimensions is very pleasing. The<br>graphics for the player character are a bit crap, but seeing as he'll be<br>on screen for all of a few seconds I really couldn't give two figs. Still<br>need to code the beginning of the end sequence (did the fun bit with the<br>planet landing first. Cheeky me.) and see if Will Morton's got any music<br>hanging around I could pilfer for it. Also *really* need to do some more<br>sound effects. Gah! Boredom approaches!<br><br>V0.999 - Well, I'm pretty much done now. All I need now is a tiny wee media<br>file or two and it's all dealt with. In the mean time I've found a few wee<br>bugs including one that dropped the tracker collar off of rooms on map rooms<br>below a certain level (stoopid typo) and another which meant you could<br>collect bonuses when you were dead as your ship flew back to the restart<br>position. Together with the bugs that Russ found I reckon it's almost<br>bug-free. Obviously not completely, though. ;)<br>Finished the end sequence as well. Not brilliant but not bad. Certainly a<br>crapload better than the original one (seeing as there wasn't one in the<br>original version).<br> <br><br> Dr Derek Doctors<br><br>Work: P4-2Ghz, 512MB RAM, GF3<br>Home: Athlon 1.2Ghz, 512MB RAM, GeForce 3 </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Cybernoid 2</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2002-01-04)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Just a duplicate of what's in the readme.txt which gives details of how far along the game is.<br><br>V0.9
 - Private demo release lacking most of the levels and some graphics 
such as explosions but the majority of the programming is done. All that
 really needs sorting is the end of level guff, the end of game effect 
and the implementation of Terabit's lovely pak file stuff. As for bugs, 
well, I think it's relatively free of them, but if you find some then do
 give us a yell.<br><br>V0.91 - Private demo release lacking a few 
levels, some graphics and a fair few sound effects. This version has the
 .PAK stuff implemented and a nice new intro for the various involved 
parties in the project. Also fixed the ship to face forward at the end 
of levels. May have accidentally included porn in the data.pak file. ;)<br><br>V0.92 - Um, I forget what was new in this one... C'est la vie.<br><br>V0.93
 - A few new sound effects, abut the main change is a whopping great 
speed increase brought about by a blindingly obvious change to the room 
display code. Quite why I didn't think of it earlier is a mystery... 
Also added some new debug stuff so I could see what it was spending most
 of its time doing (which *was* drawing the screen but now nothing is an
 obvious resource drain). This debug mode has the knock-on effect of 
making the game appear really ugly so I can safely put out BETA test 
copies without the risk of it doing the rounds too much. Might be 
interesting to see how she flies on a P200... Also might have fixed the 
end-of-level stuff. Oh, and I made the Gunports easier to blow up (they 
are now vulnerable 40% of the time instead of just 20%).<br><br>V0.94 - 
Well, it's December 31st now (2am) and I've just finished programming in
 all the joypad support after having not touched the game for several 
months. Tsk, eh? Anyhow, it seems to work okay on my machine (WinXP 
using a PSJOY adapter and a PS1 DSP). Lets hope it works on everyone 
elses, eh?<br><br>V0.94b - Gah! Well, it's a few days later and John 
Blythe has pointed out a piffling little fact, which is that pads like 
the M$ Sidewinder have analogue D-Pads. Oh buttocks. Well, a few 
graphics and a swift recode later and I now support those accursed 
things. Just hope it works on his machine. No idea why his keyboard 
controls ceased working, though... Also discovered after replaying the 
original that even if you don't get the 1500 points of cargo you advance
 to the next level. Always assumed it made you replay the level for some
 reason. Odd. Anyhow, I altered my version to match.<br><br>V0.95 - 
Righty, Russ sent over the last level of the original today, which I 
shoved a few more tiles into (because he didn't have the graphics for 
them so he couldn't have done it) and also added some of the new 
destructable blobby things to them (like the green tentacle thing in the
 original Cybernoid). I've shoved a whole bunch of these into the game 
to liven up the ship a little and give you something else to destroy. 
Next up is to draw some new background tiles as the current ones tiled 
too much. Bloody John Blythe! ;)<br> <br><br> Dr Derek Doctors<br><br>Work: P4-2Ghz, 512MB RAM, GF3<br>Home: Athlon 1.2Ghz, 512MB RAM, GeForce 3 </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
