 In the original Paratrooper, firing is done using the UP arrow key. In 
my version I had reserved the space bar as well as the Z key for firing.
 I prefer Z myself, pressing the space bar repeatedly can become a bit 
noisy and less responsive.<br><br>However, what about our German friends
 who have the Z somewhere in the upper regions of their keyboard? (As 
well as many other countries where such a layout is used.) In that case 
the Y key would be better, so that has now also been added! :D<br><br><pre class="code">If (KeyDown(KEY_SPACE) Or KeyDown(KEY_Z) Or KeyDown(KEY_Y) Or KeyDown(KEY_UP)) Then

 thought adding the full screen/windowed mode option would be quite some
 work but it turns out you can simply call Graphics() again to switch to
 another color depth (for instance, 32 for full screen and 0 for 
windowed), no need to reload graphics.<br><br>(Searching on the forums I found this thread about the same topic: <a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=81821" target="_blank">http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=81821</a> ) <br><br> ---------------<br><a href="http://www.foppygames.nl/" target="_blank">Foppygames</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Sound Player</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2010-07-29)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 I ran into a problem playing a "shriek" sound when a soldier is 
attacked by a dog. At that same moment, the soldier is also deleted from
 memory. I realized after a while that I wasn't hearing the sound, and 
concluded that this was because the TChannel object was a field of the 
soldier object. When the soldier is deleted, the channel also disappears
 and the sound stops! (You could say this is realistic, but, anyway...)<br><br>At
 first I cheated a bit and solved this by having the dog produce the 
shriek sound for the soldier, since the dog never goes out of memory. Of
 course it worked but it's a bit of a funny hack.<br><br>Now I have 
added a separate sound player object, so that all sounds are playing 
from this central location, independent of the game objects that trigger
 them. This also means all sounds are loaded from the same function, 
giving me a nice overview of all sounds being used in the game.<br><br>The
 sound player type allocates a number of channels that can be used, in a
 TList. It keeps track of a TLink pointing at the channel to be used for
 the next sound. When it receives the command for playing a sound it 
will play that sound on the selected channel and move the link to the 
next channel (and to the first when the end of the list has been 
reached). I could also make it so that it selects a channel that is not 
already playing a sound but in practice the simpler approach works fine.<br><br>The TSoundPlayer type looks like this:<br><br><textarea class="codebox" name="code" readonly="true" rows="15" cols="80" wrap="OFF">Type TSoundPlayer

 The enemy soldiers now create human pyramids next to your base (once 
more than 3 have landed on either side) in order to destroy your gun, as
 in the original game. This is achieved by keeping track of the number 
of landed soldiers and the sizes of the two pyramids. Each landed 
soldier will check those values and decide whether to move in and become
 part of the pyramid.<br><br>In the meantime parachutes have been added,
 colors of helicopters and soldiers have been changed, and helicopters 
move up and down a bit while flying. I also added a title screen and a 
game over screen and the necessary program structure to switch from one 
game state to another.<br><br>It's game over when a soldier lands 
directly on the base, or when a complete pyramid is constructed 
(consisting of four soldiers) although a check for that last condition 
still has to be added. In the original, once a pyramid is under 
construction, the game is almost certainly going to end soon (although I
 understand you could still kill the soldiers by having pieces of 
helicopter wrecks fall on them). In my version I will add two dogs that 
will try their best to scare the soldiers away, and perhaps other ways 
of defeating landed soldiers. The availability of such backup plans 
would allow for more frantic attack waves, since all is not lost 
immediately when a few enemies reach the ground.<br><br><img src="334&amp;log=1759_files/manotrooper2.html"> <br><br> ---------------<br><a href="http://www.foppygames.nl/" target="_blank">Foppygames</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Mano Trooper</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2010-06-02)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Mano Trooper will be a remake of  <a href="http://members.chello.at/theodor.lauppert/games/ptrooper.htm" target="_blank">Paratrooper</a> (1982, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Kuperberg" target="_blank">Greg Kuperberg</a>),

 objects. The game will run at a resolution of 800*600 and offer a
