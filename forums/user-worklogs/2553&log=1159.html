 really thought I had momentum with the block one, and I'll probably 
come back to it before long, but now I'm working on a simpler, more 
action-packed title with a sort of 
3D-Zelda-meets-TFC-only-without-so-many-flags quality. Should be

 it going now. Above you see 100 falling cubes interacting with about 30
 stationary ones placed randomly in the level. It's a little crude, 
perhaps, but by gum it gets the job done.<br><br>For those who may have 
been following the "Here, have some physics" thread, I got sidetracked 
turning my game's 2D collision system into a 3D variety and releasing 
it, code and all. Now as I go back to my original code, it looks awfully
 kludgey, which slows me down a bit because you know I HAVE to rewrite 
it. But anyway ...<br><br>Collisions with the background are handled by 
checking all the points on the map above, below and around where the 
loose block happens to be. Then I bring in a single "point mass" verlet,
 place it right on the surface of the stationary cube even with the 
verlet in question, and check the collision. By the end of the 
physics-checking phase, that one poor little verlet has traveled to 
potentially thousands of locations on the map. And let me tell you, the 
collisions look good. There's a problem with the collision models 
getting caught on edges, but at least it works 90% of the time.<br><br>I
 almost wish I could redo my collision models for the flying cubes to 
use the same system. I can't imagine a way around that without going 
insane with sines and cosines, but hey, it's a nice idea.<br><br>Incidentally, what you see up there is two surfaces.

 I've completely scrapped my original idea for a physics system and 
tossed in some wifty verlet integration a la Thomas Jacobsen's "Advanced
 Character Physics" article on Gamasutra. Verlets ROCK HARD. 100 
bouncing spinning colliding entities at 60 fps? Yes please!<br><br>So 
I'm back where I was before, with a physics system that works plus a 
level-building algo that works; I just need to make the two ends meet. 
My stubborn insistence that all the moving blocks should be rendered as a
 single surface doesn't help things any. Speed, speed, speed, it's all 
about the speed.<br><br>On the up side, now that I have the verlet thing
 working, actual character interaction with the environment will be VERY
 easy.

 My block-building engine is complete! Since the entire level is made up
 of blocks, I've thrown together a routine which consolidates all the 
"stationary" blocks into a single model with only one surface. In so 
doing, I've learned quite a bit about Blitz3D's surface and texturing 
commands.<br><br>Consolidating all the blocks (about 300 on screen at 
once) into one surface, with a TrisRendered hovering near 3,000, changed
 my FPS from ~100 to over 600 (!). Even if I clear and rebuild the 
entire level each frame, FPS stays in the high 300's. Wow. The level is 
even multitextured with two sets of UV coordinates. I do have to run 
UpdateNormals on the level to make the lighting turn out right, which 
drops the FPS to around 150 again, but I'm going to try setting normals 
while I build the level and see if that speeds it up as much as I think 
it will.<br><br>My initial tests with the physics system are promising. 
I'm basically rewriting large parts of it while I'm writing the 
level-building system so everything is "toight as a toiger."<br><br>Next step: running characters around on the blocks, platform stylee.

 game is tentatively titled "R0X," and it's a hybrid 
adventure/action/puzzle game about an astronaut stranded on a planet 
made entirely of strange cube-shaped rocks. It'll be a 2D-esque 
sidescroller, but in 3D.<br><br>So far I've created a method to hide 
blocks if they're in the middle of a larger group, and I'm just about 
finished with a semi-realistic physics system (blocks that spin! blocks 
that collide! blocks that bounce!) and an algorithm which lets me 
consolidate groups of blocks as a single surface for quicker rendering. 
It's imperative for me to get the block engine as efficient as possible,
 since I'll eventually add a backdrop and a bunch of animated 
characters. Yes, there will be aliens. Oh yes. &lt;evil grin&gt;<br><br>More as it goes ...<br> <br><br> _________________________<br>I'd like to have Raquel Welch dropped on top of me. </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
