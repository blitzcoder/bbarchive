 The most visible work I've been doing recently is on the interface. For
 example, now the interface looks a lot more polished than it used to:<br><br><img src="3087&amp;log=1748_files/9-25-2010.png"><br><br>Still
 not finished (instead of garish colors to distinguish the buttons, they
 will soon use consistent colors and icons) but the beveled round 
buttons look much more professional than the blank squares I tested with
 for so long.<br><br>Similarly, I redid the textures on the characters in order to build an action pose of them for the main menu:<br><br><img src="3087&amp;log=1748_files/10-2-2010.png"><br><br>Painting
 character textures isn't strictly interface work, but working on the 
main menu is definitely what prompted me to finally get around to doing 
this. If you compare to the main menu's beginning a couple updates ago, 
you can see how it's evolving.<br><br>Of course now I have to design the
 rest of the screen. It's not going to be a bunch of blank buttons 
forever, and the background needs to be much more interesting. I'm 
thinking a darkly lit dungeon hallway with action lines radiating out 
from the center, like the characters are bursting forward at you.<br><br><br><br>In other news...<br><br>In
 order to get the game released faster, I've been considering dropping 
the water area. While the original plan was 4 areas to the game, 3 areas
 would still feel pretty complete. I'm not sure yet, but I'm leaning in 
that direction. <br><br> -Joe Hocking<br><a href="http://www.newarteest.com/" target="_blank">http://www.newarteest.com</a> | Interactive Art and Experimental Game Design </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>still chugging away</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2010-08-22)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> It's been quite a while since my last update so I just wanted to post a new screenshot:<br><br><img src="3087&amp;log=1748_files/8-22-2010.png"><br><br>I'm

 of those reasons were more or less out of my hands. I'm at the hardest 
point in development though, the gap between the fun work of 
implementing new features and the final sprint to the finish. Working on
 new features is easy to get motivated for, and when the finish is in 
sight it's easy to find the energy for those final steps, but right now 
I'm in the demoralizing grind of just churning out level after level

 can have an entire week go by without ever feeling motivated enough to

lots of work without bothering to document everything here. There's 
going to be much longer gaps between major milestones (eg. look, I've 
drawn the interface!) because now there are lots of existing features to
 polish. Instead of spending most of my time implementing new things, 
I'll be spending most of my time tweaking existing things.<br><br>I am 
pleased to report that the first playtests I've done went really well. 
First off, everyone who's played the game found it really compelling. A 
great sign is that they keep insisting on playing beyond what I ask them
 to (as in, I'll ask them to play two levels, but they really want to 
beat the third one too.) I've never developed a game before that drew 
people in so strongly.<br><br>Second, I got lots of great constructive 
criticism to chew on. In particular, the playtests have been really 
useful for telling me which of the tasks I already have planned are the 
highest priority. Although I expected some feedback covering tasks I 
already had planned (I specifically told people not to censor themselves
 because they're afraid of telling me something I already know,) this 
sort of feedback actually turned out to be the most important feedback 
I've gotten out of the playtests so far.<br><br>As an example, I already
 had planned to tweak the buttons on the interface to make them easier 
to tap, but I had backburnered that task in order to focus on other 
things. Well, every playtester complained about having trouble tapping 
the buttons, so I took care of that right away after the testing. <br><br> -Joe Hocking<br><a href="http://www.newarteest.com/" target="_blank">http://www.newarteest.com</a> | Interactive Art and Experimental Game Design </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>starting work on user interface</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2010-06-07)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 It's kind of silly to include a screenshot with this update since 
there's barely anything to see but oh well whatever. I've started

 my last update I've been up to all sorts of edits (in particular, I've 
built most of the second prototype level) but today I decided to 
implement a main menu. I decided to pursue this task after starting to 
plan out the first playtesting session; since there are three different 
levels to test (the preview level that shows off level shading, and both
 gameplay prototypes,) I realized the game needs a startup menu to 
select the level.<br><br>It's hard to explain what this entailed to 
someone who doesn't program, so suffice to say I've spent all day doing 
finicky code work to restructure how levels load in order to accommodate
 a main menu. <br><br> -Joe Hocking<br><a href="http://www.newarteest.com/" target="_blank">http://www.newarteest.com</a> | Interactive Art and Experimental Game Design </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>first preview trailer</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2010-06-01)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Just made a trailer to show off the prototype of the game:<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_zfF5RM01M" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_zfF5RM01M</a><br><br>Notice

 As the previous two screenshots show, I've been chugging away at the 
action-RPG combat system. Now you can attack enemies by tapping on them,
 but the enemies are still just static dummies and I need to program 
their behavior.<br><br>What I really want to mention in this post 
however is that yesterday I upgraded iminib3d, and it was a lot less 
painful than I feared. simon released version 0.4 a couple weeks ago and
 this weekend I finally got around to migrating my project to the new 
version:<br><a href="http://www.blitzmax.com/Community/posts.php?topic=90019" target="_blank">http://www.blitzmax.com/Community/posts.php?topic=90019</a><br><br>As
 would happen with most IDEs, in XCode when moving all the stuff I 
created (game code and graphics) to integrate into a new project, there 
was a lot of fiddly adjusting of settings I had to do to make it all 
work again. Apparently I've become practiced enough with XCode that I 
knew all the steps required without having to look anything up, so 
moving the project turned out to be much easier than setting it up in 
the first place because I know what I'm doing now.<br><br>That was a 
pleasant development, but I still prefer the non-IDE approach of some 
other development tools and programming languages, where all the files 
just sit in the directories you setup without any central index to 
fiddle with, editing the code is done through a separate text editor 
rather than integrated with that central index of files, and the 
compiler or interpreter is simply invoked through a command line. I know
 I'm probably in the minority on that one, and other programmers rave 
about this or that full-featured IDE, but I do not like dealing with the
 extra layers of complexity.<br><br><br>Anyway, with the latest version 
of iminib3d came a bunch of welcome bug fixes (basically, a number of 
adjustments I made to work around bugs are no longer necessary, making 
the code a little cleaner and more robust,) along with... iPad support! 
The latter is very exciting but not something I'm planning to do much 
playing around with for the time being. I'm going to keep concentrating 
on getting this game finished, and then after the iPhone version is 
finished maybe I'll look at putting together an iPad version. <br><br> -Joe Hocking<br><a href="http://www.newarteest.com/" target="_blank">http://www.newarteest.com</a> | Interactive Art and Experimental Game Design </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>FIRE</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2010-05-06)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> <img src="3087&amp;log=1748_files/5-6-2010.png"> <br><br> -Joe Hocking<br><a href="http://www.newarteest.com/" target="_blank">http://www.newarteest.com</a> | Interactive Art and Experimental Game Design </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>ATTACK</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2010-05-05)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> <img src="3087&amp;log=1748_files/5-5-2010.png"> <br><br> -Joe Hocking<br><a href="http://www.newarteest.com/" target="_blank">http://www.newarteest.com</a> | Interactive Art and Experimental Game Design </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>first gameplay video</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2010-05-01)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Just a quick update to link to the gameplay video I just recorded:<br><a href="http://vimeo.com/11385987" target="_blank">http://vimeo.com/11385987</a><br><br>You can see that the enemy isn't functional yet, but I've implemented stuff like locked doors and switches. <br><br> -Joe Hocking<br><a href="http://www.newarteest.com/" target="_blank">http://www.newarteest.com</a> | Interactive Art and Experimental Game Design </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>filling out the level</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2010-04-27)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 I am very close to having a playable level all finished, at which point
 I'll start having other people playtest the level. In this screenshot 
you can see all three characters with animations, plus I've created 
graphics for other elements of the level (an enemy, a key, a treasure 
chest, etc.) Now I need to program functionality for the devices (eg. 
collect keys and use them to open locks.)<br><br><img src="3087&amp;log=1748_files/4-27-2010.png"><br><br>A few semi-interesting things to note...<br><br>First
 off, I can use a two-finger gesture to rotate the map. I had mentioned 
this in a previous post actually, but never actually showed a screenshot
 of a rotated map.<br><br>I have on my todo list a bunch of standard 
iPhone features to implement (resume from call, multitasking in the new 
OS 4, stuff like that) but one thing I've had since the first prototype 
is two-finger gestures like pinching and sliding to control the camera, 
just like using the Maps app. I'll see in playtesting how useful people 
actually find that functionality, but I thought it was a neat feature.<br><br>Incidentally,
 there are actually two subtly different kinds of movement control that I
 need to playtest; that's what the white button does, it toggles between
 the movement controls. There's movement to where the player tapped, and
 movement toward where the player is touching. These are subtly 
different and I need to see which players prefer; move to target like 
Diablo on PC, or move while touching like Zelda on DS. Even if both 
options are in the settings screen, there still needs to be a default.<br><br><br><br>Another
 thing to point out is that I've written an XML export script for Maya 
(and then, just for the hell of it, Blender too.) This way I can layout 
the devices within Maya, and then simply save their positions to an XML 
file. The game will read that XML data to place devices around the 
level. I suppose I could write even more tools to use for level editing,
 but already this is pretty slick if I do say so myself.<br><br><br><br>Oh
 and I'm rather proud that I got stuff done while trapped overseas. I 
live in Chicago, but I happened to be in Spain for a conference when the
 volcano in Iceland erupted. Doh!<br><br>The goblin you see in the 
screenshot was largely modeled whie I was sitting on the floor in 
Madrid's airport. Amusingly, some English kid walking by complimented my
 laptop and asked if I play Warcraft. <br><br> -Joe Hocking<br><a href="http://www.newarteest.com/" target="_blank">http://www.newarteest.com</a> | Interactive Art and Experimental Game Design </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>the main characters</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2010-04-17)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Here are the three main characters:<br><br><img src="3087&amp;log=1748_files/4-17-2010.png"><br><br>The
 models are complete. I used under 400 polygons for each character (350 
for the dwarf, so that I can use 50 polygons for the hammer he carries) 
because the iPhone is very limited in polycount. I'll probably work on 
the textures more later, but this is great for a first draft.<br><br>Note
 that I changed the color of the pixie's hair. Close up blonde looked 
great, but once I put her in the game I found that, with the tight 
top-down camera angle, her hair and skin colors just kind of blended 
together and looked blah.<br><br>While working on these I realized I 
need to model one other character, a goblin enemy, before I start 
working on the various traps and devices in the level. <br><br> -Joe Hocking<br><a href="http://www.newarteest.com/" target="_blank">http://www.newarteest.com</a> | Interactive Art and Experimental Game Design </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>wip characters</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2010-04-06)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> I've started modeling the characters:<br><br><img src="3087&amp;log=1748_files/4-6-2010.png"><br><br>Up
 until now I've simply used blocks to stand in for the characters, 
representing them while I worked on the movement controls. Obviously I'm
 only half-way done; I've only modeled two of the three main characters,
 and their textures are just basic flat colors for now.<br><br>The three
 characters are going to be a flying pixie, gnome wizard, and dwarf 
fighter. I'll post better images of the characters once I've modeled all
 three and have worked on the textures more.<br><br><br>Incidentally, I 
threw in a subtle blob shadow underneath the characters. I wasn't sure 
before if I needed shadows, but it was really hard to pick out the 
characters against the floor texture without that dark contrast.<br><br>I
 also noticed that at this extreme downward-facing camera angle I had to
 skew the characters for them to look good. Basically, I scaled them in 
code so that they are short and stout; in any closeups (don't know if 
there will be, but it's good to think ahead) I can easily return the 
scale to normal. <br><br> -Joe Hocking<br><a href="http://www.newarteest.com/" target="_blank">http://www.newarteest.com</a> | Interactive Art and Experimental Game Design </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>bitmap fonts</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2010-03-30)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">

 halfway tempted to just keep this look, but I want it to be a dungeon, 
not some abstract space maze. That said, I think I'll move onto other 
tasks for now before finishing the level textures, because I still need 
to do dynamic text display for the GUI (ie. display text that changes 
during the game, not just an image that has text on it) and had some 
great ideas for that. <br><br> -Joe Hocking<br><a href="http://www.newarteest.com/" target="_blank">http://www.newarteest.com</a> | Interactive Art and Experimental Game Design </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>finally caught up to the present</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2010-03-21)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 I decided to tackle a few housekeeping sort of tasks just to get them 
out of the way so that I could get back to concentrating on fun stuff. 
First I restructured the code to a clean object-oriented architecture 
(up until now I was simply barfing out code as fast as possible just to 
see if it works.)<br><br>I also moved the entire XCode project to 
Dropbox for no-brainer version control and sharing of files. The latter 
is important because, even though I'm the only developer working on this
 game, I frequently have to shift around between different machines 
while working. It's pretty cool to touch up a 3D model on my desktop PC 
and then immediately hit compile on the Mac in my lap.<br><br>I also 
spent a little time making sure I could display 2D graphics for the 
game's GUI. In particular, I had to make sure all the math was right for
 pixel-perfect display of 2D images in a 3D scene. Here's a fullscreen 
image I displayed as a test:<br><br><img src="3087&amp;log=1748_files/3-19-2010.png"><br><br>Alright,
 back to the level. I already started testing the level after just 
laying out the basic shapes, but then I had to assign vertex colors to 
differentiate walls, floors, and bottomless pits. I had a difficult time
 putting together an art pipeline that would work for this project; I 
went through about half a dozen different partial-solutions for how to 
get models from Maya to .b3d file format with baked lighting, vertex 
colors, and skeletal animation.<br><br>I won't go into the gory details,
 but suffice to say that it involves multiple pieces of software on 
multiple computers, plus there are two different pipelines for levels 
and characters. ouch<br><br>But the effort was worth it! Here's the 
level with colors applied (note the vertex colors that look like the 
hole descends into blackness):<br><br><img src="3087&amp;log=1748_files/3-21-2010.png"><br><br>The vertex colors look great for now, but I really need to start texturing the level. Probably tomorrow...<br><br><br>ASIDE:
 While working on that level I realized I should split off a separate 
branch of the project where I can test levels by loading them directly, 
without the baggage of the (eventual) start screen or level progression 
or any of the other stuff that will go in the final game. I added that 
task to my todo list for after I'm done programming all the various 
devices that will go in the levels. <br><br> -Joe Hocking<br><a href="http://www.newarteest.com/" target="_blank">http://www.newarteest.com</a> | Interactive Art and Experimental Game Design </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>up to last week</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2010-03-21)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 First I programmed a test of the controls. While the game design has 
existed in a mostly complete state for a long time, obviously I had to 
adapt the control scheme to the unique environment of the iPhone. I 
threw a bunch of big shapes onto a green plane for some test scenery, 
and then I plunked a few cubes into the scene to represent characters:<br><br><img src="3087&amp;log=1748_files/3-10-2010.png"><br><br>That
 prototype worked pretty well. The characters move to where you tap the 
screen, and you can rotate the scene with a two-finger gesture. 
Naturally I had a few kinks to work out; in particular, I discovered a 
few bugs in iminib3d that I had to work around.<br><br>My next step was 
to design a prototype level. It needed to involve many of the different 
obstacles and devices that would comprise the puzzles in this game. 
Here's the level I designed:<br><br><img src="3087&amp;log=1748_files/3-15-2010.png"><br><br>I
 figure I'll go through a few prototype levels before I start developing
 the finished levels that will go in the game. Anyway here's the 
beginning of the model in Maya:<br><br><img src="3087&amp;log=1748_files/3-17-2010.png"><br><br>Actually
 this screenshot isn't what I modeled first, this is after I did a 
couple iterations of testing and tweaking. Right after building the 
initial model, before doing any more work on coloring the level or 
anything, I plopped it in the movement prototype to get a feel for 
scale. Immediately I realized my initial guess at how large to make the 
level was way off, and that I needed to make the walls lower and the 
corridors wider and less cramped. It's always a good idea to figure out 
the fundamentals of scaling while it's still easy to adjust. <br><br> -Joe Hocking<br><a href="http://www.newarteest.com/" target="_blank">http://www.newarteest.com</a> | Interactive Art and Experimental Game Design </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>settling on a game design</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2010-03-21)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 For a while now I've been kicking around plans for what to do for my 
first iPhone game. A few weeks ago I finally settled on a puzzle RPG. My
 plans for after this project include other game designs I have in mind,
 and probably purchasing Unity to use for future projects. For right now
 however I will be using the Blitz3D-based open-source engine <a href="http://www.blitzmax.com/Community/posts.php?topic=85763" target="_blank">iminib3d.</a><br><br>Using
 iminib3d has a few consequences for me, the most interesting of which 
is that I will be programming in C++ for the first time. Now, learning 
C++ while working on a game is not as big a deal as it might sound at 
first, since I am already quite proficient at programming in a variety 
of object-oriented languages. I just happened to have never needed C++ 
before, so it's been interesting to see how features I'm familiar with 
in other languages relate to this language that most people consider the
 most fundamental in modern computing.<br><br><br><br>That's what I find
 interesting about this project from a technical perspective. From a 
game design perspective however, what's interesting is how old an idea 
this game is. Because the iPhone is such a new platform, most people 
associate iPhone games with very new concepts. In fact however most 
iPhone games are based on game designs that predate the platform, 
sometimes by decades.<br><br>For example, I first came up with this game
 almost 10 years ago, and the game I designed drew heavily from games I 
played in the early-90s like the Legend of Zelda and Lost Vikings. 
Here's an illustration of one of the characters that I had drawn back 
in, oh, maybe 2001:<br><br><img src="3087&amp;log=1748_files/aerth_icon.png"><br><br>Notice
 that I scaled the image down to be an app icon. Obviously that's a 
primitive old sketch, and I'll be replacing it with a much better image 
once the game is finished, but for now that works great as the icon on 
my iPhone while I develop this.<br><br>...<br><br>Oh before I forget, 
the game is called Chronicles of Aerth. I have no idea if that name will
 survive until the end of the project, but I do like it! <br><br> -Joe Hocking<br><a href="http://www.newarteest.com/" target="_blank">http://www.newarteest.com</a> | Interactive Art and Experimental Game Design </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>explaining why</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2010-03-21)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> A few years ago I decided to keep a worklog as I developed a game, Gyroman. Inspired by <a href="http://www.blitzmax.com/logs/userlog.php?user=6&amp;log=1368" target="_blank">simonh's worklog for Super Gerball,</a> I kept a journal of my progress with screenshots, hoping to end up with as spiffy of a development diary.<br><br>Well
 as unfortunately happens sometimes, that project died part of the way 
through. It's too bad, because the project got off to a great start. 
Actually, there's a chance I'll resurrect Gyroman, since it's a 
dual-stick shooter and that genre is pretty popular on iPhone. However, 
for now I'm working on a new project, and once again I decided to keep a
 worklog here that will try to be as inspiring and educational as the 
one for Super Gerball was. <br><br> -Joe Hocking<br><a href="http://www.newarteest.com/" target="_blank">http://www.newarteest.com</a> | Interactive Art and Experimental Game Design </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
