 starting working on this important tool for 3D artist, which will allow
 them to process "animmesh" levels through their hierarchies, light it 
with coloured lights, so making possibile effects such as multi coloured
 rooms, circular light marks of fixed lights and more, then save all the
 work in a binary/txt file, and then have it loaded in the game very 
fast.<br><br>Please tell me if anybody already started something like that, so to don't spread work, and make 2 clones of the same tool.<br><br>Basically
 will be a compiled exe with file prompt, that will do shademesh, and 
lightmesh, at particular coordinates and specified RGB, calculate all of
 them (approx 20 min for a complex level and let's say 20 lights) then 
save all in a binary file,<br>and a Function for your games, that will load this information from within this binary file.<br><br>Comments on the programming forum are appreciated.<br> <br><br> -------------------------<br><a href="http://www.litobyte.com/" target="_blank">Litobyte software</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
