 Finally worked out how to get the rudders on the joystick to work 
(althouygh it is still not perfect as yet, I think I will have to pester
 about with questions) I have finally decided to just start to program 
everything separately as I think it would be too kludgy to put 
everything together, I still need a lot of help especially with getting 
the keyboard controls and the joystick controls to work ah well back to 
the drawing board<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Astro Warrior and Solar Dominion Update</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2002-10-30)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 New Screenshots are now in progress for Solar Dominion, now that Blitz 
can now detect joystick throttles including USB there is now little 
reason not to start on the programming, first comes Astro Warrior, 
ported from 3D RAD, still I tried to contact Chroma about the base 
throttle thing, I know you need a negative number for reverse, question 
is how do you do this when the code looks like the numbers are negative 
anyway, still hopefully I will get an answer to that soon, nearly all 
the models for Solar Dominion are done, only Space and land Cargo 
transport needs to be done and changing all the models to MDL2 format 
for animation purposes(i.e. for the hovercraft Fans and Space/Aircraft 
landing) need to find out however how to make neutral vehicles so either
 player or A.I pilots can enter them and also so that both player &amp; 
a.i. pilots can control them.<br><br>Astro Warrior models are all 
finished, I was going to put a tank level in it but I might do that in 
the sequel, right now I just want to get it done, I need to work out how
 to do diffrent levels and splash screens so I can do a planetary 
mission as well as a space mission, if I can do that then I might still 
do a couple of tank levels, and some way of getting in and out of 
vehicles just to break the monotony of being in a spacecraft all the 
time, .For Solar Dominion I wish to get the Pandromeda Software, Mojo 
World Generator so I can actually have a virtual cyberplanet for the 3D 
R.T.S. as supposed to just a map, as it would be interesting to be able 
to go to actual worlds in cyberspace, problem is, as the worlds when 
rendered so all the detail, the game might only be able to run properly 
on Pentium 3 600MHz and above and I only have a P2 350, still I will 
need to upgrade it to a P3 1.0 GHZ  and I can still use Bryce 5 for less
 powerful machines, I could do 2 versions of the game, one higher 
version and one lower version.<br><br>Will also have to put up another 
web page and get my web address changed so people can see the 
screenshots, and I need to submit some up onto the Blitz board. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
