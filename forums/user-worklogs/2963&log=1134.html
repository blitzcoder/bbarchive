 OK, I haven't been very good about keeping up an online worklog.  Sled 
Jammer has taken a big back seat to my puzzle/strategy game, Cubex.  
Cubex is about 90% complete!! I am currently making final Game levels, 
and polishing up the code a little bit.  Both Single and Multiplayer 
work well so far, though I've only tested the MP with 2 players, and the
 game can handle up to 4.  So I need to beta test with 4 players, but I 
think I'll wait until I've got all the game levels completed before I go
 there.  For now, I'm cranking out levels, optimizing the code, and 
looking at publishers.  It feels good to almost be done with my first 
one!<br> <br><br> _________________________________________<br>Desktop: Athlon 2100 | 512 MB | 128MB Radeon 9000 Pro<br>Laptop: Intel P4 2GHz | 256 MB | Radeon Mobile 32MB<br>C  |  C++  |  Blitz3D  |  VB  |  Java<br><a href="http://www.forestmarkstudios.com/" target="_blank">Forest Mark Studios &lt;&lt; Cubex | Horse Essentials | Military Essentials &gt;&gt;</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>In the face of Change</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2002-10-21)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Lately a lot of effort has been to merge the movement code written by 
my partner in SJ with the main code.  This has proved to be a temendous

 I'm back from my Honeymoon (it was GREAT!!!), and working hard on 3 
projects!  That's right, 3!  SledJammer is still the biggest fish in the
 pond, but I decided to work on 2 smaller products to publish in the 
near future and hopefully get some much needed cashflow going.  One is a
 puzzle game which is about 50% complete (after about 6 total hours of 
coding and graphics work) , and the other is a 2D space shooter/breakout
 variation.  I hope to push these to a budget software publisher before 
December.<br><br>My partner has written a pretty good control system / 
and camera code for SJ.  We now have the sled on scene, with some 
rudimentary collision detection.  Before we go any further though, we've
 got to merge the code. It wasn't written modularly (is that a word??), 
but needs to be so that multiple ships can be passed to the ship control
 module.  Once we merge all of it, I'll add shadow code.<br> <br><br> _________________________________________<br>Desktop: Athlon 2100 | 512 MB | 128MB Radeon 9000 Pro<br>Laptop: Intel P4 2GHz | 256 MB | Radeon Mobile 32MB<br>C  |  C++  |  Blitz3D  |  VB  |  Java<br><a href="http://www.forestmarkstudios.com/" target="_blank">Forest Mark Studios &lt;&lt; Cubex | Horse Essentials | Military Essentials &gt;&gt;</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Editor</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2002-09-07)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">

based (though I think I'll make it graphic soon), and currently saves 3D
 terrain tiles/ respective their locations to one another, level splash

 OK, here are the very first screenshots of SledJammer.  Not a 
tremendous amount happening here, just trying to get the terrain system 
down, and the atmosphere looking right.  Camera movement has been coded,
 and soon the first "Sled" (thus the name) will be added.  An untextured
 picture can be seen at the bottom in the NEW GAME menu shot.<br><br>The
 game menus are animated but obviously that can't be seen in these 
stills.  All of these were taken at 1280x1024x32 resolution.  As you can
 see, it's running at 63 fps right now.  That's what the limiter is set 
to (which works wonderful!)  I've run this on a 400 Mhz machine with 8 
meg of ram and it ran at 1024x768x16 at 20 fps.  Despite the lower 
framerates, all the movement/acceleration were just as smooth as on my 
development system!  This is the beginning of the first level of the 
game, which will be a "Training" level 'ala mechwarriors training 
sessions'.  Hope you enjoy!! <br><br><br>[Deleted]<br><br>Just some 
terrain shots with a little river running through the scene.  This 
Trainer terrain is scaled to be 16 square kilometers.  All the textures 
were manually drawn in Photoshop.  No lightmaps yet, and haven't placed 
any "objects" in yet (physics tests with the sled are being conducted 
with another level).<br><br>[Deleted]<br><br>This is a pic of my options
 menu..  It of course doesn't have all the options placed in yet.  I 
just wanted to get some bare bones in first to work with.<br><br>[Deleted]<br><br>I
 am pretty pleased with the water effect I got on this level.  I made 
about 16 different water textures in Photoshop, and this one so far has 
one the prize for my favorite!  I'm working on coding a procedural water
 tex, but I don't know if that will put too much of a hit on the 
processor to really make it worth it.. We'll see!<br><br>[Deleted]<br><br>My
 Main Menu!!  I developed a mouseOver command to handle this menu 
system.  You can see the New Game button "highlighted" as my mouse 
cursor moves over it.<br><br>[Deleted]<br><br>Above is an untextured Trainer sled.

 working on the level loading code today.  Initially I have the function
 set to hold an array of 16 terrain tiles (each tile is currently scaled
 to be 4x4 kilometers or 16 square kilometers).  My type structures are 
getting a little more complex than I would care for, but to keep 
everything as modular as possible I'm trying to hold all objects in

 Well, I sometimes feel like I'm going 3 steps forward, one step back.. 
 Right now I feel like I'm in that one step back phase!  I've been 
wrestling with the Resolution change function from the options menu 
after testing it on a number of systems and reallizing that while it 
works perfectly on my development system, it doesn't on others..  I 
think I've got it somewhat improved though, but need to take it to other
 test platforms..<br><br>I've added some visual improvements to the GUI since the last entry.  Mainly animations, but also some performance tweeking.<br><br>The
 majority of what I've been doing is building(modelling and texturing) 
the first three levels for the game, and designing a level 
loading/scripting system.  I've achieved pretty good results so far(at 
least with atmosphere, clouds, and sun w/lens flare) though my water 
texture leaves a little to be desired!<br><br>I feel like I'm pulling 
multiple jobs right now!  Definitely feel that I've been pretty heavy on
 the graphic arts this last week, learning to use Photoshop relatively 
well(creating my own brush textures now!!!!

 my wedding just 18 days around the corner, I don't have an abundance of
 time either.  I'm grabbing 10 minutes here, 20 minutes there to tweak

and I feel like a lot of progress has been made.  The GUI options menu

 week with testing some sled control code, so hopefully  that won't take
 too long to complete.<br><br>Started on the New Game menu, which is about 20% complete.<br><br>After

 Man... I just spent 30 minutes writing this huge Log entry and 
accidentally hit the back button on my browser and lost it...... 
UUURRRRGGGGGGGHHHH..  Well, it's almost midnight and I don't really have
 time to write it again, so I'll just post a summery of this weekend's 
coding events:<br><br>1)  Gained a "partner in crime" to assist with this project.<br>      i.  His first project is player movement<br>          with gravity simulation<br><br>2)  Fixed a bug in the 3d sprite move routine so that now times under 1 second can be passed to it<br><br>3)  Added 4 functional buttons to the GUI<br><br>4)  Added a graphics mode selection and in game change routine<br><br>5)  Converted the game engine to a Message based State Machine (for lack of a better term)<br><br>6)  Did a TON of housekeeping to my existing code.<br><br>7)  Gave the GUI it's own file, and mouse movement it's own function (rather than being embedded in the GUI)<br><br>8)  Added multiple sound effects to the GUI<br><br>9)  Added memory clean-up routines<br><br>So,
  it's been a busy weekend.. I polled the forums for a bug I'm having 
with the lower resolutions.. Seems only every other row is being drawn 
on the screen.  Things look pretty bad.  Will have to come back to it 
when I'm fresh, and maybe try it on a different system to see if the 
effect persists there.<br><br>It's getting late..

 In my last entry, I noted an entity doesn't exist error that was 
driving me nuts!  Wouldn't you know, I was saving the wrong path name in
 the data file!!  Sometimes you look over the simplist mistake!  <br><br>Anyway,
 yesterday I worked on my GUI, specifically the main game menu.  I wrote
 3d mouse functionality, a 3D Mouse Over command (though its got a quirk
 [not quite a bug] that I'll have to work out later), and highlighting 
buttons.  The menu runs pretty smooth, and contains animated layers!  
Also added the bg_music for the Game Menu.  I still need to add 
"functionality" to the buttons, and create the "sub-menu" routines. I 
also improved the data file routines..<br><br>A large part of this time

 OK, so I've spent some pretty impressive time coding and testing my 
compound data types to hold most of the game object data.  Also, I've 
written routines to write most of this out to files.  I'm having 
problems reading one of the data members though, and I haven't been able
 to get the debugger working to figure out what what's going wrong.  All
 I'm doing is storing an object's model path, and then retrieving it to 
be displayed, which "loads fine" but then gives me an "Entity doesn't 
exist" error when I go to position the object??   Hmm.  It's kind of 
stumped me, but the Forums have provided me with some tips on using the 
debugger, so I'll try tonight when I get home from work to resolve the 
issue..<br><br>Next on the To Do List:<br><pre class="code">Develope the GUI!!!!

 Today I opened NotePad at work, and spent endless hours coding (or 
recoding rather) my SledJammer.  I decided to restructure the entire 
program and make it as modular as possible.  I'm doing this to make my 
code more portable, so that it can be used in other engines.  In 
addition, I'm making the code very abstract, and trying not to hard-code
 anything.  This should make editing levels and attributes much easier!<br><br>So,
 after coming home from work I took my files I revamped in NotePad, and 
pulled them into B3D!  Luckily very few typos, but I did run across 
something that took me a while to work through.  I am using compounded 
types (types within types) to form complex structures.  It's the closest
 thing I can do to get mimic classes and inherited structures.  Luckily,
 after hours of staring at this forsaken monitor, I have my existing 
code bug free!<br><br>Added ScreenShot Code (untested)<br>Added Basic movement code<br>Improved
 the graphics initiallization sequence.  Now it searches first for 
available 32-bit modes and selects them if available.  16-bit mode 
issues a warning of decreased graphic quality.<br>Added the framework 
for gravity code (each object can be effected by gravity differently!  
Each object has a gravity modifier value, so a feather can "float" 
gently to the ground while a piece of steel will fall hard..  There's a 
default gravity value that effects all objects, and then the modifier 
optionally effects that initial value).<br><br>To Do:<br>-Create a basic "Test Level", and get my ship moving<br>-Find/make some suitable sound effects!<br><br>Well,
 I'm not going to write a book tonight (my fingers are pretty tired ;-),
 but I think the improvements I've made will make the entire development
 process much smoother!<br> <br><br> _________________________________________<br>Desktop: Athlon 2100 | 512 MB | 128MB Radeon 9000 Pro<br>Laptop: Intel P4 2GHz | 256 MB | Radeon Mobile 32MB<br>C  |  C++  |  Blitz3D  |  VB  |  Java<br><a href="http://www.forestmarkstudios.com/" target="_blank">Forest Mark Studios &lt;&lt; Cubex | Horse Essentials | Military Essentials &gt;&gt;</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Book is In</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2002-08-04)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Well, yesterday I got the "official" B3D book and boxed version.  I was
 pretty excited.  Even more so simply because the box was from the UK...
 I don't think I've every received mail from overseas before, so it was 
cool seeing their postage marks and everything.. OK, I know that sounds 
weird, but I thought it was cool.<br><br>So, the first thing I did was 
open the book and fly through it looking for morsels of wisdom.  I found
 a few suggestions that should help in structuring my software, so off 
to the drawing board for more development!<br> <br><br> _________________________________________<br>Desktop: Athlon 2100 | 512 MB | 128MB Radeon 9000 Pro<br>Laptop: Intel P4 2GHz | 256 MB | Radeon Mobile 32MB<br>C  |  C++  |  Blitz3D  |  VB  |  Java<br><a href="http://www.forestmarkstudios.com/" target="_blank">Forest Mark Studios &lt;&lt; Cubex | Horse Essentials | Military Essentials &gt;&gt;</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>SledJammer Engine Build</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2002-08-02)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
     Hey!  It's my first B3D worklog ever!!  I feel like I should get a 
prize or something!  Anyway, I've got about 5 game designs in my feeble 
brain, and decided to work on the "easiest" one first.  I'm projecting a
 6 month development period for it since I'm currently the only one 
working on it, and learning/adapting to B3D from C++ as we go.  I plan 
to market the game after it's completion along with a MOD-guide to help 
player's to build their own levels.  Possibly some development tools 
(though may keep those proprietary {sp?}).<br><br>Intended Features:<br>    Multiplayer Support for up to 16 players<br>    Single Player mode<br>    Smart-Variable decision AI<br>         Includes flocking patterns<br>         Includes coordinated hunting<br>    Realistic Physics<br>    Soft Shadows<br>    Particles<br>    Realistic Skies (multi-layered/animated)<br>    Rolling Fog/Haze    keyboard/mouse/joystick support<br>    Fully Customizable KeyMapping with the ability to save custom KeyMaps<br><br>
 SledJammer(tentative name) game design began July 25 2002.  To this 
point, the majority of work done has been with in-game utility 
functions, types, and file structures.  To date, the following have been
 added:<br><br>CreateGameConfig (complete) - Creates GameConfig.DAT if not already made.<br><br>PreGameConfig (complete) - If GameConfig.Dat has not been initiallized once, initiallize with default settings<br><br>CheckGameConfig (part-complete/doesn't correctly call CreateGameConfig if file doesn't exist?)<br><br>UtilityFunction (complete) - based on global flags, reports FPS, Triangles Rendered, Camera Positioning, etc.. <br><br>Created Types:<br>   Player (includes Ship, KeyMap type)<br>   Ship (includes Weapon type)<br>   Weapon<br>   KeyMap<br><br>
   Today, I ran my first test of the engine.  Not too much happening yet
 on the screen yet: 1 terrain(textured), 1 model(2500 polygons, 
textured, poly-reduction will take place before launch), BG Music, 
Movement via cursor keys, and 1 light source.  Ran smoothly at 
1024x768x32 at 76 fps(though I'm sure this is my monitor refresh rate). 
 This is without a lot of optimization, but none the less, I got things 
up and moving.<br><br>INPROCESS:<br> Working on a level/world description file format, and a level script parser.<br><br>
 Currently looking for 3D artists/animators (I love 3d modeling, but if I
 did all the models, it would take me at least 2x as long to develop)<br><br>
 Researching Shadow routines.  I want to be able to pass an entity to 
function and have shadows calculated in that function..  Needs to be 
fast!  Most of what I have encountered is too slow for  multientity 
shadowing.<br><br>To Do:<br>ScreenShot routine<br>Collision Detection<br>Physics<br>Enemy AI<br>Networking (UDP vs TCP?)<br><br>  Well running out of time for this entry.  Will post again once more has been added.<br><br>
  Before ending just let me say 'Mark, this is an incredible piece of 
work!  Especially coming from one primary coder!  My hat is off to you!'<br> <br><br> _________________________________________<br>Desktop: Athlon 2100 | 512 MB | 128MB Radeon 9000 Pro<br>Laptop: Intel P4 2GHz | 256 MB | Radeon Mobile 32MB<br>C  |  C++  |  Blitz3D  |  VB  |  Java<br><a href="http://www.forestmarkstudios.com/" target="_blank">Forest Mark Studios &lt;&lt; Cubex | Horse Essentials | Military Essentials &gt;&gt;</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
