 started rolling my own console thru WriteConsole, since blitzplus's has
 annoying behaviour, but it isn't quite working yet. Not real sure why,

</pre><br><br>I know, it doesn't look like much, but I'm handcrafting 
this, as opposed to using a compiler generation tool. Its a decent 
amount of work( well about 4 hours worth this time ).<br><br>One can 
probably come up with some quick and dirty ways to parse and translate 
^that^, but hacks won't really workout in the longhaul. I've had a few 
other attempts at compilers, and the code can get gnarly and out of 
control real quick, if you dont keep it in check.<br><br>And I've still 
got plenty of things to add. The stuff that really makes a compiler a 
"compiler"... Putting in some quicky hack just wont work. Nope. I'm doin
 it proper. Well mostly. I'm doing 2 passes, 1 for scanning the source 
and creating a tokenized "stream", and then another pass which parses 
the tokens and generates the code. I've yet to see the need for a 
parse/abstract syntax tree ...but I'm still n00b at this ^_^<br><br>I've
 learned a bunch from my previous attempts, and I feel more comfortable 
this time around. Its going much faster and smoother.<br><br>Long term 
plan is to slowly build it in blitz, until it is self hosting..The 
language I envision is sort of a middleground between c and basic. Best 
of both worlds.<br><br>I should probably be doing this in c#, but I've 
had this itch to do a large-ish project in blitz, something that would 
be kinda cool to say "I made that". I've written a lot of code in blitz 
over the years, but most of it hasn't been seen by anyone besides 
myself, which is a bummer. I also thought about doing a console 
emulator....<br><br>Hmmmmm.... Maybe I'll do both o_O<br><br>...Anyways went off on a tangent, next steps:<br><br>-Expressions... right now they only consist of either a variable or a number.. no add ops or anything of the sort<br>-Code generation<br>-Print keyword - just a temporary keyword so I can get some output, since I dont have function calls yet.<br>-"If" construct.. need to control program flow<br><br>This is my fun project though, so probably gonna be a weekend thing.<br><br>Stay tuned.<br> <br><br> ------------------------------------<br>"Fall down seven times, get up eight."<br><a href="http://devblog.timbarela.com/" target="_blank">http://devblog.timbarela.com</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
