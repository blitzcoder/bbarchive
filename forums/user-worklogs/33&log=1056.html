 I've gone completely mad working through issues in MaxPlay.  It works 
and is just undergoing optimizations and tweaking.  <br><br>MaxPlay 
works exactly the same way (on the surface) as DirectPlay, and is a 
replacement overlay networking library.  All that has to be done is Max_
 added to the front of the commands.  <br><br>Max_JoinNetGame()<br>Max_HostNetGame()...<br>Max_RcvNetMsg()<br>Max_SendNetMsg()<br><br>This
 way if you have developed a multiplayer game using direct play you can 
pretty much instantly overcome the reliable message pauses and 
instability.<br><br>I am going to take the lib well beyond this but this version will be free to the public source included.<br><br>You would not believe the amount of debug and profile code that is in this thing ;)<br><br>So, Once I get this completed its back to GalAxis and the adding of the components that will make it a real game!<br><br>Skully<br> <br><br> Anth800 w/128Mb Ati All-in-Wonder 32DDR<br>P3-450 w/128Mb TNT2<br>P3-450 w/128Mb i740 &amp; Voodoo2<br> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>GalaxyBlitz3D</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2002-05-30)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> I've been working on the MaxPlay networking back end for my games and am almost complete!<br><br>I
 needed a known working, and hopefully fun to play, game to test it with
 so I brought GalaxyBlitz back to life! Its popularity has caused me to 
develop it farther than I originally intended before getting back to 
MaxPlay and now its fun!<br><br>I plan to get back to development and fully complete this game after I finish MaxPlay - maybe a week from now. <br><br>I
 have GB working surprisingly well with DirectPlay but the DX7 version 
still leaves much to be desired - like locking systems up when the host 
isn't running, how dumb of MS... I hope they fixed that with the DX8 
version that I will never use :)<br><br>Now that I have the game 
playable and people seem to like it I will go back to finishing the 
MaxPlay back end and then go back to GalaxyBlitz.<br><br>The name is 
likely going to change to "Galactic Domination" though as it seems more 
popular than GalaxyBlitz... oppinions to submissions@...<br><br>Anyway...

 Gee.. for some reason I get asked over and over to put up a new 
worklog.. and the weird thing is people keep calling me The Man, or 
Mark, and various other names ;)<br><br>I have returned to my network 
layer (SOFTUDP) after looking at Surreals.  His is very nice work but I 
feel I need to complete the work I have done on mine otherwise it's 
something I haven't completed. I like to complete what I start and I 
started this for reasons of learning.  Also for my upcoming cool shooter
 game GalaxyBlitz3D ;)<br><br>The other reason is that I can't really

 Well, as my first entry I'll just say that I doubt many people are 
going to find my projects fasinating or anything but just in case anyone
 is interested here is the status of what I am up to:<br><br>Work on GalaxyBlitz3D:<br>This
 project is under way but has boiled down to the network layer for the 
time being.  I believe that you cannot make a good multiplayer game by 
jamming the network stuff in after the fact.. it needs to be in there 
from the ground up... just look at the Civilization series if you 
question that &lt;- and on a personal note, whats which Civilization 3 
not being multiplayer once again! not buying that one.  But I digress.<br><br>Since
 I have decided to make that Network layer transportable between 
projects, I have issolated the code into an include and am working on 
the internals.<br><br>I am using UDP as DPlay and TCP was just too slow 
for this type of project.  As well, I dont know many multiplayer games 
worth their salt that use Dplay, other than turn based ones.<br><br>The commands that would mean anything to you right now are :<br><br>HostUDPGame, JoinUDPGame, QuitUDPGame<br>SendUDPBcst, TargetUDPMsg, and UDPTimeSync<br><br>There
 is still much testing to do including developing data rate and queue 
size dynamic  adjustment for the highest network performance.<br><br>I'll be coordinating that with those on the #blitzPC DALnet irc channel that consumes more of my time than it should.<br> <br>Every project that I have in the queue is on hold for UDP networking... including BlitzChat3D which needs UDP for the speed ;)<br><br>Skully<br> <br><br> Anth800 w/128Mb Ati All-in-Wonder 32DDR<br>P3-450 w/128Mb TNT2<br>P3-450 w/128Mb i740 &amp; Voodoo2<br> </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
