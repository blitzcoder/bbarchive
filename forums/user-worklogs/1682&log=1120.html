 the value in line 8 of 11.map to change the game speed to suit your pc 
spec - will try and work a timer in later!!   The lower the number the 
faster the game will run - the higher the slower it will run.<br><br>Let me know what you think!<br><br>_________________________________________<br>Have been kinda busy, but I got my ADSL connection on line at last - soooooo i've been busy playing with that!<br><br>I've re-coded the AI - i was able to guess its moves! - now its a better hunter. <br><br>I did try putting a timer on the was to set them back to unlit after a set time, but, it was crap! so its been ditched!<br><br>Player and monster homes are now working, and the player can now be hurt from contact with the bad guys.<br><br>Each room now has a background, that lights up as you pass over it.<br><br>Exits now open once all the walls are lit - also the monters now return to their home when the walls are lit.<br><br>Next
 thing I am working on it getting the dead monsters to make a run for an
 exit - if the player catches them then you gain energy.<br><br>Thats it! Now my connection it back I will be putting a working demo up over the next day or two.<br><br>------------------------------------------------<br><br><br><br><br>Where are the Blitz 2D work logs? 3D overload!!<br><br>I’ve decided to write a game based VERY loosely on a game I once played on my C16.<br><br>The idea is that you run around a top down map lighting up the walls, while avoiding the nasty things that live there.<br><br>So far I’ve done: -<br><br>Map engine – uses different graphics for the walls per map<br>Each map read in can specify the graphic set to use for the walls and monsters, as well as the animation speeds<br>		<br>Player movement, including lighting up the walls the player passes<br>Monster AI and set in place code to make sure the player looses energy if contact is made<br>Monster, player and wall animation are now working independently, so that everything doesn’t animate at the same time.<br><br>Things I will be doing next are: -<br>Creating player power level, so the monsters can start hurting<br>Putting a timer on each wall block lit up so that it becomes un-lit if the player is taking to long<br>Set up player and monster homes that only a monster / player can enter<br>Make exit doors open once all walls are lit<br><br>Much more to do but these must be worked on first.<br>I will try to get a working example of what I’ve done on line so you can have a look and maybe tell me what you think so far!<br>CurlyJ :-)<br> <br><br> Im just a simple person ;-) </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
