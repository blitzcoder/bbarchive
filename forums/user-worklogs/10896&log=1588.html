(mayaman101) for agreeing to provide us with temporary graphics. It will
 make our life a lot easier and will speed up the production time of the

 of right now, but I should be able to post one up in a few weeks, once

Players create an account and then create heroes under their main account. <br><br>These
 heroes can participate in online matches against other opponents. The 
matches provide players with fame, gold, and experience points. As 
players gain experience they are able to level up and gain new skills 
and spells which may be used during a battle. The players can also 
purchase and auction equipment, which provides a boost in statistics or 
match starting conditions. <br><br>When players create a hero they are 
forced to join one of several orders. The object of the game is to fight
 for your order in an attempt to assert it as the best order in the 
game.<br><br>The game itself will employ many unique strategic elements 
(combo of skills/spells) which can be used to dispatch ones opponent. <br><br>The game will initially feature:<br>** 6 unique classes and 6 hybrid classes with each class having a unique play style. <br>** 4 different orders which players can join<br>** ability to create clans/guilds within an order<br>** single player play (if you so choose)<br>** multiplayer play (main aspect of the game)<br>** online tournaments (with cash rewards proposed for some)<br>**
 dynamic economy that alters price of goods based on demand, dynamic 
system to ensure good equipment is not easy to obtain, special rare 
equipment given away in tournaments<br>** ability to wager gold and equipment (game goods) on matches<br>** built in ranking system and incentives for orders (promotes competitive gameplay)<br><br>The game will have three types of accounts<br>1)
 Free Account -- This account type is limited to a single hero and can 
only choose one of the main 4 classes. They can only level to 30 instead
 of 50, but have the option to "remort" per say and play a hybrid 
character if they start back at level 1 (still capped at level 30). This
 account type is supported by in-game banner based advertisements.<br><br>2)
 Paid Single Account -- This type of account can be purchased in 
non-renewable 3/6/12 month subscription packages at a cost of: 
$15/$25/$35 per account. These accounts do not have any restrictions and
 can play special classes just for paid accounts. <br><br>3) Paid Family
 Account -- This type of account can be purchased in non-renewable 
3/6/12 month subscription packages at a cost of: $25/$40/$60 per 
account. These accounts do not have any restrictions and can play 
special classes just for paid accounts. Furthermore, this allows up to 3
 heroes to be logged in under a single account allowing multiple family 
members/friends to play together under a single account. These heroes 
can be password protected to ensure other family/friends do not play a 
hero that is not theirs to play. <br><br>These are only the very basic details of the game, I will keep everyone posted as more is developed. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
