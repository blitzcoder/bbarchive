 to note is if you free an entity while it's playing a sound it will 
cause your program to crash. call EntityStop3DSound() on the entity 
before freeing it to stop all sounds attached to the entity from 
playing. It was eroniously stated that freeing an entity would stop it 
from playing previously but I had forgotten to test that out... if you 
tried it your program would crash. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>v1.1 - Starts and Beginnings...</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2007-04-12)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> v1.1 - <a href="http://ima747.gotdns.com/blitzmax/minib3dSoundv1.1.zip" target="_blank">http://ima747.gotdns.com/blitzmax/minib3dSoundv1.1.zip</a><br><br>Born
 of necesity, this is a positional 3D sound system for use with MiniB3D.
 I never used Blitz3D and as such am not designing this around their 
sound system, so appologies if you're porting code. It is built around 
the Blitz Audio module, and therefore should work on any system that can
 play sound. What it does is handle all the panning, channel depth 
setting, volume tweaking and (if you enable doppler  the doppler effect)
 play rate, making a sound apear to be coming from a point in 3D space 
relative to the listen point (usualy your camera, or player character's 
head).<br><br>Currently it does not have an environmental simulation so 
walls etc will not effect a sound. However this is part of the ultimate 
goal of the project (assuming I can figure out how to do that...). 
However in it's current form it should be a servicable alternative to 
just playing sounds straight up.<br><br>It is designed as a module, and 
requires minib3d to be installed as a module as well. As a module it has
 a documentation through the internal help system. It can very easily be
 modified to be an external include/import rather than a module, just 
poke around at the top of the file. I will eventualy distribute it like 
minib3d, in module and include form, but for now you just have to tweak 
the top 3 lines or so.<br><br>Included in version 1.1 (released along 
with the start of this worklog) are some example programs to get you 
started. A basic example of how to add it to an existing project. And an
 advanced example of most features and functions of the sytem in 
practice with real world examples of why you might want to use a given 
feature.<br><br>I'm looking for feedback and input so if you are confused, or have any things you'd like to see added please contact me.<br><br>Now if only I could screenshot sound to give you a better idea of how this works... <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
