 Back in action!  Been a while, so the first thing I did was go through 
the loop and optimize a few calls.  I think I got a few cycles out of 
the deal, though I hate replacing nice, neat function calls.<br><br>Rewriting
 the monster waypointing logic, and having much more luck this time.  In
 fact, it's safe to say that waypointing is finally working properly; 
it's destination changing that's a little off-kilter this time, and 
that's a much easier nut.<br><br>Expect Alpha 2, with all 6 trap types and two kinds of monsters patrolling the dungeon, some time next week...<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>brogue 0.4.3</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2002-01-04)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Grrrrr.  Bloody monsters!<br><br>I've
 come a long way in understanding exactly what the old AI routines are 
doing, and the plan I formed to translate the old AI to the real-time 
environment works well enough to go with (ie, not perfect, but good 
enough, and beats the heck out of rolling my own AI!).  It's an awesome 
feeling to flip wireframe on and watch the monsters navigate the rooms 
and the corridors...<br><br>Of course, I =have= to bloody turn wireframe
 on, because inevitably the stinking stupid things fail to completely 
follow my carefully coded AI, and so in short order end up either in a 
Mexican standoff with each other or stuck on a doorway with a protruding
 arch.  I've had one tenacious ant manage to stay mobile for about five 
minutes (and he WAS very cool to follow around), but eventually he got 
stuck as well.  *&amp;#$&amp;#^*$!!!<br><br>The logic is clear, the code
 somehow fails to conform to the logic, and debugging is definitely not 
my strongest suit.  If I can solve this one tiny, insignificant little 
problem I'll be able to move on (and even release a new demo), but for 
now I'm stuck on it.  Time to play some Wizardry 8.<br><br>Grrrrr.

 brogue jumped to version 0.4.0 with the completion of all six original 
rogue trap types: teleport, bear, sleep gas, pit, dart and rust.  All of
 them work well, and all come accompanied with animated models, particle
 effects, sound effects and so forth where appropriate.  I'm proud of 
the way they came out, and while I was playing with my simple particle 
engine I threw in some dungeon dressing -- there are a few random points
 in the tunnels now that drip water.  Nothing big, but it's fun to be 
trotting around in the dungeon and hear the drips get farther and 
closer. ;)  Also, as a result of some very helpful feedback from the 
Blitz IRC gang, I've converted the game to achieve steady gameplay on 
any rig, regardless of framerate.  Still having some trouble with 
tweening and RenderWorld, but I'm sure it'll come. <br><br>The next 
milestone is a big one: monsters.  The deeper I dig into the old 
sources, especially in the monster code, the nastier parts of them are. 
 There are a LOT of globals, a lot of wild assumptions, and some 
=extremely= ugly design hacks that work fine for a turn-based ASCII game
 but totally ruin anything approaching realtime (one, for instance, 
completely circumvents the main game loop while the rogue hangs around 
paralyzed.  Yikes!).<br><br>Having said that, though, I've finally got 
all of the old movement code translated from C into Blitz, and by 
sacrificing some grey cells I've come up with a gameplan to make the old
 movement routines work in tandem with 3D waypoints in realtime.  There 
is a LOT of work to do before a playable demo with patrolling and 
attacking monsters becomes available, but the method is clear now, at 
least, and I'm making headway.<br><br>If I'm especially lucky and/or inspired, a playable demo with working monster AI may be available the second week of January.<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>brogue 0.3.4: alpha one</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2001-12-18)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 First public release to get a feel for how the engine's performing on a
 variety of boxes, find bugs I haven't seen yet, etc.  Not much 
functionality change from 0.3.1, though one real trap is in now, there 
are pick-up sounds for some objects, and the whole thing has been 
converted to use Terabit's data packing routines.<br><br>Interested parties can download the beta <a href="http://www.echthros.com/files/brogue034.zip" target="_blank">here</a>.<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>brogue 0.3.1</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2001-12-16)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Stairs are now in, as are both EdzUp's random dungeons and BasicGamer's
 perfect mazes.  Levels choose randomly between these variants on 
creation, and all stocking routines work perfectly with them.  I'm 
having some strangeness in the player placement occur here and there, 
but other than that oddment things are moving along.<br><br>Rudimentary 
traps are in; for now I'm displaying them as translucent red boxes, so I
 know they've actually been placed properly.  Implementing them is going
 to be a little odd, as Blitz doesn't have any native means of detecting
 collision but not affecting the movement of the colliding entities!  
I've created some simple models to represent traps in the game, and am 
trying my best to make them inconspicuous enough to stumble into, but 
spottable if you're really cautious.<br><br>Spurred on by gema's post on
 internet data transfer through CGI, brogue also now has an 
internet-enabled high-score board.  It's currently rudimentary and does 
not do any encryption or security, but it does maintain a top-ten list 
of the highest scores, and does some basic error detection and 
information verification.  The code to enable it in BB is also 
implemented, so while it's somewhat premature (as there's no game to 
play yet!), when the game IS playable, the net scoreboard will be 
available for competitive solo Rogues.<br><br>Next up: finishing trap 
collision &amp; effects, basic monster placement, and support for 
inventories -- both player and monster!<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>brogue 0.1.2</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2001-12-11)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 I've started work on a rogue clone (brogue = blitz rogue) with a twist 
-- this one's as true to the original sources as possible, but instead 
of the traditional turn-based, top-down, ASCII-art gameplay, I'm 
throwing all that out and turning it into a first-person realtime 
dungeon hack.<br><br>In a slight departure from the original, I've 
nearly finished incorporating EdzUp's random dungeon generation code, 
and I'm working on putting in functionality to create a perfect maze as a
 level variant as well, so there will be a bit more level types to play 
in than rogue's original 9 rooms.<br><br>In order to keep the rest of 
the gameplay as true as possible to the original, I'm working from the 
original rogue 5.3 C source and porting a fairly large percentage of it 
over.  The original level creation and stocking code is, in fact, 
completely ported as of now, and I'm moving on to the next stage of the 
alpha, which is the placement of stairs and traps in the level.<br><br>Also
 in keeping with the original, when complete brogue will be freeware and
 open source -- so keep your eyes peeled, and let me know if there are 
any special bits you'd like to see in the game!<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
