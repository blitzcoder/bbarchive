 Sadly, I lost all of the work I was doing on BrodyGUI in an unexpected 
hard drive wipe and I'm not focusing on doing a 2D GUI library using all
 2D commands, with a focus toward using it in a hacking game (a la 
Uplink). As for the 3D (sprite-based) GUI lib, I'll figure out how to do
 that without using nSprite later.<br><br>PersistentWorld3D is still in 
need of a sprite-based GUI and this doesn't help it any, I know. I hope

 I finally found out the best way to render levels made of huge bitmaps.
 As John Carmack did on the first generation IBM, he got smooth speeds 
by copying portions of the level in for rendering. In this case, I'm 
loading in the huge bitmaps BUT instead of rendering them with 
DrawImage, I render them by copying what portion of the level needs to 
be rendered using the CopyRect command. BlitzMax doesn't have this (why 
is beyond me) so I'm prototyping in Blitz3D with nSprite. Once I have it
 figured out in Blitz3D, I'll find out how to get it working in 
BlitzMax.<br><br>Other than that, no progress has been made since last update.<br> <br><br> -----------------------------<br><a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/logs/userlog.php?user=7622&amp;log=441" target="_blank">Battle Forces Worklog</a> | <a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/logs/userlog.php?log=459&amp;user=7622" target="_blank">BrodyGUI Worklog</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>About BrodyGUI</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2005-04-05)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 BrodyGUI is a small project I'm working on to create a free 
sprite-based GUI library using nSprite Pro. The problem right now is how
 I'm going to make it free when it uses a commercial library. Anyways, 
I'm building it to be capable of being more like a windows shell for 
Blitz applications than just a library that lets you create windows and 
gadgets. Already I have a taskbar and support for a desktop wallpaper of
 choice drawn for a background (which is totally optional of course). 
I'm planning on putting in an optional start menu and right-click menus.<br><br>I'm
 partly making this for the sake of PersistentWorld3D, which is in need 
of a GUI interface. If anyone can contribute a bitmap font library with a
 Blitz-like commandset that I can use for this, that would be super.<br> <br><br> -----------------------------<br><a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/logs/userlog.php?user=7622&amp;log=441" target="_blank">Battle Forces Worklog</a> | <a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/logs/userlog.php?log=459&amp;user=7622" target="_blank">BrodyGUI Worklog</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Progress Overview</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2005-04-05)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> <b>PARENT GADGETS</b><br><img src="7622&amp;log=1253_files/wip.jpg"> Windows<br><img src="7622&amp;log=1253_files/wip.jpg"> Taskbar<br><img src="7622&amp;log=1253_files/tbd.jpg"> Start Menu<br><img src="7622&amp;log=1253_files/tbd.jpg"> Right-Click Menu<br><br><b>CHILD GADGETS</b><br><img src="7622&amp;log=1253_files/tbd.jpg"> Labels<br><img src="7622&amp;log=1253_files/tbd.jpg"> Buttons<br><img src="7622&amp;log=1253_files/tbd.jpg"> Textbox<br><img src="7622&amp;log=1253_files/tbd.jpg"> Menus<br><img src="7622&amp;log=1253_files/tbd.jpg"> Sub-Menus<br><img src="7622&amp;log=1253_files/tbd.jpg"> Listboxes<br><img src="7622&amp;log=1253_files/tbd.jpg"> Comboboxes<br><img src="7622&amp;log=1253_files/tbd.jpg"> Tabs<br><img src="7622&amp;log=1253_files/tbd.jpg"> Tab Pages<br><img src="7622&amp;log=1253_files/tbd.jpg"> Radio Buttons<br><img src="7622&amp;log=1253_files/tbd.jpg"> Checkboxes<br><br><b>OTHER FEATURES</b><br><img src="7622&amp;log=1253_files/stop.jpg"> Skin Support<br><img src="7622&amp;log=1253_files/done.jpg"> "Desktop" Wallpaper<br><img src="7622&amp;log=1253_files/tbd.jpg"> GUI Editor<br> <br><br> -----------------------------<br><a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/logs/userlog.php?user=7622&amp;log=441" target="_blank">Battle Forces Worklog</a> | <a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/logs/userlog.php?log=459&amp;user=7622" target="_blank">BrodyGUI Worklog</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Then the concept is shown!</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2005-03-25)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 I'll shed more light on the gist of Battle Forces. The theme is taking 
stereotypes and cutting them down to the lowest common demoninators. 
What most movies and games typically choose to imply are simply made 
completely blatent. To be a bit clearer, I just dumb down everything so 
they're as dumb as they can possibly be made dumb. The good guys are 
good because they're supposed to save the day, the bad guys are bad 
because they're supposed to give the good guys something to be good 
about. If you want an intelligent story and theme, this is the exact 
opposite of what you're looking for.<br><br>It's the <b><a href="http://www.nferno.net/upload/userfiles/UberLieutenant/battleforces/goodguy-body.png" target="_blank">Good Guys</a></b> against the <b><a href="http://www.nferno.net/upload/userfiles/UberLieutenant/battleforces/badguy-pistol.png" target="_blank">Bad Guys</a></b>
 and they have guns because they want to be badass without any real 
combat skills. Whether this will end up being a single-player adventure 
or a multiplayer deathmatch game, I don't know. But either way, I'm 
going to cut down on the use of language as much as I can so translating
 the game into French, Japanese, or whatever is a 10 minute job. The 
Blitz community is mostly European so I'm going to make sure this is at 
least in English, French, and German on release so everybody can judge 
how much this game sucks (I'm an ultra newb programmer with not much 
under his belt except game design concepts and practices down pat). If I
 get requests for other supported languages after release, I'll get my 
girlfriend on it - she knows just about any language I can think of, 
including French, German, Austrian, Polish, Russian, Japanese, and 
written Chinese. Don't worry, I'm covered :)<br><br>That's a further 
taste of what Battle Forces is...well, is NOT considering I only have 
level collisions implemented, and nothing else. Hell, I don't even have 
the player walking or running when on the ground. Those sprites I showed
 above are the Good Guy and Bad Guy sprites as I have them right now. 
I'm going to have bodies and legs as seperate sprites later on and have 
animations for both. I'll reiterate that all these sprites and such are 
being made from scratch with Photoshop CS (8.0). Until now I haven't 
done a heck of a lot of original work, as I usually found myself doing 
vector traces like these:<br><br>1. <a href="http://www.nferno.net/upload/userfiles/UberLieutenant/traces/monster-tenma.png" target="_blank"> Kenzou Tenma</a> from <a href="http://www.animesuki.com/series.php/378.html" target="_blank">the anime Monster</a> (WATCH IT - Best detective-style show ever)<br>2. <a href="http://www.nferno.net/upload/userfiles/UberLieutenant/traces/naru-goku.png" target="_blank">Narusegawa</a> from <a href="http://www.animenfo.com/animetitle,242,jqhwyg,love_hina.html" target="_blank">Love Hina</a><br>3. <a href="http://www.nferno.net/upload/userfiles/UberLieutenant/traces/edwardelric.png" target="_blank">Edward Elric</a> from <a href="http://www.fullmetalalchemist.com/flash_index.html" target="_blank">Fullmetal Alchemist</a><br><br>Hopefully I'll get more work done on the BF source code soon.<br> <br><br> -----------------------------<br><a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/logs/userlog.php?user=7622&amp;log=441" target="_blank">Battle Forces Worklog</a> | <a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/logs/userlog.php?log=459&amp;user=7622" target="_blank">BrodyGUI Worklog</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>...and then barely anything.</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2005-03-24)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 My work in BF has been at snail speed the past couple weeks because 
I've been keeping myself on the PersistantWorld3D interface with still 
nothing working. Additionally, I've been toying around in Blitz3D trying
 to make a camera system that works much like Splinter Cell, and after 
three sleepless nights, no progress has been made whatsoever. It's cool 
to be lazy!<br><br>What I have managed to do in Battle Forces since the 
last log entry was improving the level collisions so that now the player
 falls onto the floor rather than through it. As far as walking through 
walls and "jump-climbing" ledges goes, no progress has been made. But I 
did manage to get on my ass and upload a screenshot so you have a clue 
as to what I'm doing. A clue is better than nothing.<br><br><img src="7622&amp;log=1253_files/bf-ss01.png"><br><br>If your browser can't view PNG files, then let me quote Mr. T: "I pitty the fool who doesn't use <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/" target="_blank">Firefox</a>."

 I've been working on a 2D platformer for a while now in Blitz3D relying
 almost entirely on nSprite library commands. That has changed and I'm 
now starting to build a simple prototype so I can get the basics rights 
before I write it in an organized and efficiant manner. One step at a 
time here.<br><br>The idea is a 2D game (ref:Soldat) with single-player 
levels comprised of 3 image layers. Each layer is a part of the map; 
there's the background, the player's collision area, and the foreground.
 And yes, this means I'm making levels with 3 large bitmaps acting as 
the environment. How I'm going to make that solid and fast is beyond me 
for the time being.<br><br>What's motivating me with this project is how
 I've always wanted to play this game (well, about 2 years now) and no 
matter what other ideas I contemplate, this is the one I want to play 
the most. Game developers anywhere will tell you they do their best work
 on games they want to play like an over-hyped game with an unannounced 
release date. This will be under development for a long time (I really 
don't know if it's months or years). But this is a game that will 
represent the most committed work I've done, and hopefully it will show 
through in the final product.<br><br>I will post a screenshot once I can
 get the player/level collisions working properly. Having nothing 
special to present wouldn't do much justice to my reputation. Oh, and 
FYI I've been using Photoshop for 3+ years and Blitz for about 2+, so 
I'm doing all the sprites and code myself.<br> <br><br> -----------------------------<br><a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/logs/userlog.php?user=7622&amp;log=441" target="_blank">Battle Forces Worklog</a> | <a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/logs/userlog.php?log=459&amp;user=7622" target="_blank">BrodyGUI Worklog</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
