 I have decided to build "proper" levels for Super Blitz Bros, rather 
than the maze-based levels seen previously. It's still in the early 
stages of being implemented but I built a very quick (i.e. 5 mins work) 
map in Maplet (awesome tool) just to test out a few ideas. Here is a 
pic:<br><br><img src="982&amp;log=1189_files/newmap.jpg"><br><br>I think
 this is going to work out quite well! The real levels will be larger 
than the one shown in the pic (about 4 times the size) and I will also 
be adding things like trees and other objects to keep the landscape

I could tell that<br>players were finding this aspect of the gameplay highly<br>frustrating so now coins are on a timer and will reappear after a<br>certain time and be deducted from your collection total. This<br>means that if you take too long, or die too many times you will<br>have to collect those early coins again!<br><br>- Option to turn off moving floors! A number of people told me<br>that playing my game made them feel dizzy and/or sick. I think<br>this might be caused by the constantly moving floor beneath the<br>player so there is now an option in the main menu to toggle this<br>on and off.

 I've changed it so that all the coins do NOT come back when you die! 
Now they are on a timer so that if you take too long to complete the 
level (i.e. die too many times or drag your feet!) they will start 
popping back into existence and you will have to go collect them again. 
I'm quite pleased with it!<br><br>That's the most obvious change at present, but things I am considering are:<br><br>- Removing the moving water, apparently it's causing motion sickness in some players...<br>-
 Changing the multiplayer mode so instead of 4 small cameras (or 3, or 
2...) you got a more "zoomed out" view so you can see the whole level at

 Some of you may have noticed that my sig recently changed from RETIRED

 Please ignore horrible place-holder sprites, I've only been working on 
this one night and couldn't be bothered to make a decent one!]<br><br>It's
 a fairly simple 3D platformer where you have to collect the stars on 
the level, avoiding the monsters as you go. Yes, kind of like Pacman I 
suppose, but I intend to add a few more bits and pieces to it yet.<br><br>But... why the "BROS" bit in the title? Well, that's there for split-screen multiplayer...<br><br><img src="982&amp;log=1189_files/multi.jpg"><br><br>You
 will be able to play with any combination of 1 through 4 players! The

 After playing through all of the 18 holes last night I realised that 
they were all VERY long. Whilst I had made a conscious effort to try and
 make some of them shorter they were all coming out as 4/5 shot holes.<br><br>I
 realised that this is all down to the size of my terrain, i.e. 640x640,
 with 1 unit = 1 metre in my game. For those not following the maths, 
that means that my terrains are 640 metres x 640 metres, quite large for
 a golf hole!<br><br>After much thinking last night I have decided to 
cut this back to 512 x 512. It will mean a bit of re-coding in the game 
(not too much) and re-doing some of the holes, which is a pain but I 
think the results will be worth it.<br><br>I've still got a few other

new bits to the code. I also pulled out my meshterrain code and replaced
 it with blitz terrains. Lots of reasons for this that I won't bore 
people with now, but it makes my life slightly easier.<br><br>I should 
have a limited demo version by the end of next week but I'm afraid it 
will only be going to certain pre-selected testers for comments and 
feedback - it's not ready for the wider audience just yet!!<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Par FORE!

 of work this week, I've reduced some of the text (in terms of number of
 words used, not the size of the font!) shown on the HUD and added 
several new items, including the height of the ball and the difference 
in height between the ball and the pin.<br><br>Also added the mini-map 
(on the left of the screen) which also tracks the movement of the ball

 I have been implementing the new terrain system. This has been one of 
the biggest hurdles for me and at one point it was going to be a bunch 
of squares rather than nice rounded bunkers, lakes, etc. Whilst that 
wouldn't necessarily have been a bad thing, it didn't really fit with 
the golfer models. If they had been modelled very angular, made from 
boxes for example, then it would have been a consistent look and would 
have worked well. But I digress (sorry!) and I should get back to the 
point.<br> <br>The game uses mesh terrains rather than blitz terrains, 
I'll come to why in a minute. Due to the lack of dynamic LOD I have had 
to make some sacrifices. For instance I can't use heightmaps that are 
nice and big, like 512x512 as this would result in a model with 524,288 
polygons - waaaaaay too much! So my heightmaps are 64x64, they seem to 
work nicely in my testing, I tried using 128x128 but got too much 
slowdown when the ball was in-flight.<br> <br>So why NOT use blitz 
terrains? Well, I need to make a hole for the ball to go down and I 
can't do that using blitz terrains, the terrainmodify command isn't 
precise enough. To actually make the hole I have to add CSG functions to
 the game, a bit of an overkill probably, but they seem to work well in 
my little test program.<br> <br>By the way, a big advantage of the small
 heightmaps is the amount of diskspace they take up. I like to use PNG 
files for graphics, so these figures are based on that, but anyway...<br> <br>Sample heightmap @ 512x512 = 132 Kb<br>Sample heightmap @ 64x64 = 6 Kb<br> <br>If
 the heightmaps were size 512x512 and there were 90 of them (5 courses x
 18 holes) then that would be nearly 12 Mb of data. Whereas the 64x64 
heightmaps take up just about half a Mb, perfect for downloading!<br> <br>The next few tasks on my to-do list are:<br>* Add CSG functions<br>* Add holemap and plot balls position<br>* Changes (improvements) to ball chase camera<br>* Start churning out holes/courses<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Launched my website!</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2003-07-17)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> I've got my website up, it can be found at:<br><br><a href="http://www.babybrowngames.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.babybrowngames.co.uk</a><br><br>I'd appreciate feedback, please mail it to contact@....<br><br>If
