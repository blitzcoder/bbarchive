 Yeah, its been awhile since I've posted on here. But I want everyone to
 know that I have been working on this project more and more lately, as 
now I have an entire class period devoted to its programming. <br><br>I 
have gotten the tanks to explode when they die now, and also am working 
on getting a text messaging system back into the program. It works great

 I finally finished up on the weapons and will be uploading Mongi Online
 v1.0 fairly soon. Into this version I've also incorporated simple 
coding that will alert and give the player a url of a new Mongi version 
is available.<br><br>So now the weapons in Mongi Online v1.0 will be 
normal lasers, machine gun, flamethrower, missles, mortar cannon, GU 
Ball, and mines. Hopefully these should keep players busy while I work 
on future versions. There will be more weapons in the future, as "Gun 
Buddies" were a recently suggested idea. For those who never played 
"BattleTanks" a gun buddy is an automatically targeting cannon that a 
player can place anywhere on the battlefield. This could make CTF 
matches even more chaotic.<br><br>I'll let you all know when I have uploaded the new version. :)<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Pre-Game Lobbies</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2005-09-29)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 I've gotten most of the clan coding done now, and soon will begin 
testing on it. I've had a few school assignments that have been slowing 
me down with Mongi progress lately, but hopefully tomorrow proves to be 
fruitful. <br><br>What I hope to get done tomorrow is coding fro a 
Pre-Game lobby, that would separate in-game play from the main lobby. In
 this lobby the players would divide onto teams. After this coding is 
done with the lobby, I've been neglecting the finishing touches upon the
 machine gun.<br><br>The machine gun will be my final weapon installment
 for awhile. Capable of high fire-rates, the machine guns is not the 
most accurate weapon, buts its range is fairly decent, with a decent 
amount of ammo as well. <br><br>I hope to have all these done into 
Mongi3D Online v1.0, and released within about a week and a half, before
 I leave for two weeks.<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Clans + Levels</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2005-09-25)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Today I picked up a new program for level making. It lightened my

work on a new primitive map that I call the BoomBox. Its basically a 
hollowed out cube with a few doodads in there. However, being that it is
 a more cramped map, the chaos will be more immense. There's nowhere to 
hide in it.<br><br>As for clans, I'm wrapping up on coding to get it set
 into place. At this point in time a player can make a clan for his/her 
self, but they cannot invite any new members into it, making kinda 
pointless at this point. I hope to have this "invite code" done by

 Today I finished up the flamethrower. It is devastating at short range

 Ok tonight I introduce you to two new weapons, the GU Ball and mines. 
These are not the only new weapons I am going to include in the new 
version, so expect more to come soon.<br><br>First off, the mines. 
Coming in clips of four, these mines can be laid anywhere on the map, 
mines deliver a serious blow (usually a kill) to the enemy's health. The
 problem, they are bigger mines so it is easy for enemys to see them. 
But if you either put them in strategic locations and/or force enemies 
near them, they can turn the battle in your favor. Here's what you do 
not wanna drive over on the battlefield.<br><br><img src="8800&amp;log=1308_files/Mines.PNG"><br><br>Next
 is the wonderous GU Ball. What does it do you ask? Well, the answer to 
that is who knows? Doing a range of random attacks the GU Ball could 
either inflict serious death or just blind your enemy. Being as the 
attacks are random, you never know which one is gonna come next, so may 
chance be on your side....<br><br><img src="8800&amp;log=1308_files/GUBall.PNG"><br><br>Well that concludes the new weapons for today. Tomorrow I will have more of them done.

 Well one challenge gives way into another. I have managed to get the 
Mongi version with a lobby up, however next I need to get a stable 
Server running for the program to work. However with our whiny DSL modem
 and a tough Wireless router, it has been hack trying to poke enough 
port holes. Well if bad comes to worse I could just wire it in tomorrow.
 Either way, tomorrow I will have the server up. <br><br>As the work on a
 stable online system is nearing an end, I'm now beginning to focus on 
the development of gameplay, in other words : weapons. With more 
weapons, come more chaos, and with said chaos, comes entertainment. The 
next weapons that I am currently programming into the game are a 
flamethrower, machinegun, Armour Buster cannon, mines, and the odd GU 
ball. What does each weapon do? Who is to say? I will most more info and
 pics on each of these weapons tomorrow, AFTER I get the server up.<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Server Being Created...</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2005-09-17)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 OK, a skeleton version of the lobby is basically done. The personal 
profile and clan options are not coded yet, but a person can enter the 
lobby, chat, and create/join a game to play. However, as there currently
 is only one map incorporated into the code, a player does not have a 
choice at this point on what map they would like to play.<br><br>Next on
 the cooking plate is tomorrow I will be testing my Server and the lobby
 system on the internet. This should go smoothly and uneventful. This 
version will then be the foundation for the rest of my online upgrades. 
If I can get a stable online system running, I can then turn my 
attention to adding more to the gameplay (aka maps, weapons, etc). This 
should keep players interested.<br><br>Until tomorrow.... ^_^<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Lobby mostly done</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2005-09-08)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Ok, tonight not much has been going on except the elimination of a few 
bugs in the lobby code. Now turns the task of making it so other players
 can player with each other upon joining a game in the lobby. This task 
is mostly done as players can now join the same room but I just have to 
finish importing the movement code and working out the kinks. Then a 
'barebones' version of the lobby system can be released, but I am 
thinking for waiting until I have more done with the perepheral options 
(clans, friends, profile, etc).<br><br>Tomorrow I go straight to work on
 the clan's option. As many shooter games have clans for competition, 
friends, whatnot...so will this game. I also want to eventually get a 
standings listing done.<br><br>Until I can get more progress done, 
tonight I grace upon you the newest screenie of the lobby system I'm 
working on. As you can see it is basic but for the most part functional,

 On the production of the 'Lobby' program for Mongi, progress is holing 
at a nice steady rate. Though school has now started, I still find 
myself with much freetime during the day to continue work on it. So far I
 have finished the basic lobby system: Players join, see who is on, and 
can join a game on the server. At this point the test game has been 
permanantly placed on the server, while I am adding the option for 
players to create their own games on the server. Another addition to add
 into the program would be a simple chat system. While in the lobby, 
players would be able to text chat with other players also in the lobby,
 then join/create a game from there.<br><br>With the development of this online lobby comes a new awesome feature : clans.<br><br>I
 hope that the addition of clans would generate more interest in playing
 Mongi Online and forge alligances b/w clanmates. However, with more 
activity will be more misconduct, as I will have to develop a means of 
IP banning a player that is breaking the rules of proper conduct.<br><br>When
 is the massively awesome update coming? I would have to say at least a 
week. I need time to get some more coding done and test it throughly 
before uploading the new version.<br>Also in the new version will be the urban map FULLY textured. <br><br>I will get some screenies of the map and lobby system up in a few days.<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>&gt;2 Players Done</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2005-09-04)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 OK, now I've finally been able to upload a version that allows for more
 than 2 players to play together in a server. I have not tested the max 
amount of players in a game yet, and I guess that only time will tell. 
The engine is moving from peer-to-peer to more server-client based.<br><br>The
 next step is to develop coding for a 'main lobby' that would allow 
players to see currently active games and chat with current players in 
the lobby. I've got about have the coding half done. It currently lists 
the active players and servers, but now I just got to finish adding 
coding for players creating and joining the servers listed. I hope to 
have this done in a few days, after which time I will begin converting a

 you are connecting to.<br><br>Example:<br>Person A enters Person B's IP, and vice versa.<br><br>If you do not know your Internet IP, many sites can check it for you.
