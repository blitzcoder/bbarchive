 Been working on the object placement editor and terrain editor 
(probably will combine them).  I like what I see.  Using Cartography 
shop 4 for building, well, buildings . . . I began creating a small 
level with around 60 items - and so far, nice fast 60FPS and could 
probably be higher, but I am limiting frame rate to 60FPS.<br><br>Got 
scale, rotation, x,y,z placement and rotation, terrain scaling, terrain 
vertex building (and smoothing), camera and light placement all working.
  Creating the database array for the entire enchilada to load and save -
 essentially the file and data system for GECKO.  This is the hard part.
  Just how big is big?  How big of an array will it handle before it 
bogs?  Dunno yet.<br><br>Mike<br> <br><br> If you require video, custom music or sound fx for your games, go to www.world-class-multimedia.com </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Created the orthographic interface</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2005-01-25)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Created the main orthographic interface for world building.  It has 
many features already implemented, but working on straightening some of 
the movement code for the top-down view.<br><br>The flow goes like this:
  Use the front, side and back views for 3d object and prefab placement,
 use the top down to make sure everything lines up and to find stuff 
quickly.<br><br>I will make a snap-to function so that you can snap 
levels or objects together to make seamless worlds (snap will work for 
terrains, objects and prefabs)<br><br>I am also going to make a search 
function so you can find an object, prefab or terrain quickly by 
entering coordinates or by clicking on the object's name from a list<br><br>As
 a side note, if any accomplished 3D programmers wish to join up with 
this project, I would greatly appreciate it.  This is a for-profit 
endeavor, so anyone working with me will share in the profits.  I have 
been following the FPS Creator for a long time and really dislike the 
direction it's going, so I would like to make a world creation system 
that is simply better and more open ended than that.  The FPS Creator is
 more of a beginner's tool, this will be an intermediate to advanced 
tool.  However, same end result - to build entire games within one 
program interface.<br><br>If anyone is interested, email me at mfelker@...<br><br>Please,
 only proficient programmers that are TRULY interested in joining up.  I
 value anyone's opinion, but that is NOT what I wish to see in my email 
by the hundreds.<br><br>There WILL be a website for this project at a 
certain breaking point (when enough is done to show off a superior 
looking product).<br><br>Thanks for reading this.<br> <br><br> If you require video, custom music or sound fx for your games, go to www.world-class-multimedia.com </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Quicksilver is also just about ready</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2005-01-25)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">

 non-programmer will be able to make a game from concept to completion 
in this program.  The only editors left out (for now) are texture 
editors and the editors necessary to create 3D objects.  Since fine 
programs like milkshape and photoshop exist, not to mention the mryiad 
of programs here to do the same things, as well as programs like 
Truespace and 3D Max, I figure why re-invent those particular wheels.<br><br>The
 idea for this actually came from two things.  One, as a purchaser of 
pretty much every editor here at Blitz3D, I just have not been satisfied
 with any of them COMPLETELY.  They are all EXCELLENT in their own 
rights and for what each can do.  Kudos to every programmer, every one 
of them is a gem.<br><br>However, a long time ago, a crappy little 
engine called PIE 3D game creation system existed.  Now, it was not that
 good at creating a final product that could compete with the big boys, 
but it had one thing going for it.  A VERY VERY GOOD DRAG AND DROP 
EDITOR.  You could make indoor games very easily with it.  They weren't 
that good and all resembled the original Wolfenstein 3D square room 
engine, but the editor was fun to use - so all was forgiven.<br><br>Now 
we have Blitz 3D and AMAZING programs and games being created every day -
 but none with the ease of use and just plain FUN to use ability that 
PIE had.<br><br>Enter G.E.C.K.O.<br><br>Game Entertainment Creator Kit &amp; Organizer<br><br>From this one program, you will be able to write down your thoughts, plot summaries and create your storyboards.<br><br>Then
 make those thoughts and storyboards a reality, starting with collecting
 your assets with the Library Editor.  Gather all the assets that you 
will be placing in the games.  You have to start somewhere and this is 
the most logical.  Therefore, after your idea is a little more solid, 
you now can create all the models, objects, textures - everything you 
outlined in your storyboards and illustrations.  Then load them into the
 asset management editor for later use.<br><br>On to the Terrain Editor:  Use this to create the raw terrains that will make up the "levels" of your games.<br><br>On
 to the World Building Editor:  This is where you place your assets you 
loaded into the Library editor.  Now, just those things that make up the
 terrain - such as buildings, trees, grass, statues, walls, etc - 
whatever will need collisions gets put here.  You will be able to load 
multiple terrains to make one big one and, hence, a world.  This is 
where the 2D placement editor will be - hence the PIE-like interface - 
this is used for coarse placement with a pick and drop snap to grid 
interface.  The 3D orthographic interface is used for much finer tuning 
of all placed assets.  G.E.C.K.O. is SMART - it knows the terrain 
heights and will not initially allow you to drop an asset below a 
terrain height (unless you want to).<br><br>On to the Game Editor:  This
 is where it all comes together.  Now that you have your "worlds", you 
can load them in here and place your player, enemy and vehicle assets.  
 Create the enemy AI.  Define the missions and waypoints if needed and 
define the global world attributes and all lighting.  Here you will 
"bake" the shadows into the terrain with the lightmapper.  And the 
coolest thing of all, here you will choose the game type (of course, 
this should have been decided a way long time ago) and all the necessary
 coding with be put into motion for your game, be it a flight game, FPS,
 3rd person or vehicle / driving game.  The overlay editor will allow 
for HUD items and the Menu editor will let you make the opening menus.  
You will also be able to place lakes and rivers and define how they look
 and act.  Also, this is where you place your sound effects and music 
tracks.  Finally, you can manage the databases that are automatically 
created for you throughout this process.  The last part is to compile 
your game into an .exe file as a stand-alone game or as a .bb file for 
inclusion into Blitz 3D - but people without Blitz3D will be able to 
make a game.<br><br>As you can see, G.E.C.K.O. is a major project and will take time.  If anyone wants to offer their services I won't say "no".<br><br>G.E.C.K.O.
 will come with everything you need to make one of each type of game (4 
types) from soup to nuts - as well as tutorials on how to make them 
step-by-step.  There will be libraries of prefabs and other assets 
(sound and music by yours truly).  Anyone wishing to contribute to asset
 inclusion is invited to do so with open arms.<br><br>Let me know what you think!<br><br>Mike Felker<br> <br><br> If you require video, custom music or sound fx for your games, go to www.world-class-multimedia.com </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Screenshots coming soon</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2004-08-09)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> As soon as I have enough done, I will begin to put in some screenshots.<br><br>Now have the orthographic editor up and running and about to put in the grid and snap to grid system.<br><br>After that I will begin on the 2D placement editor.<br> <br><br> If you require video, custom music or sound fx for your games, go to www.world-class-multimedia.com </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Now have the lowdown on G.E.C.K.O.</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2004-08-09)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Although this is not a complete list, this is the goal of the software and the work flow:<br><br>Name:  G.E.C.K.O.<br><br>Game Entertainment Creator Kit &amp; Organizer<br><br>Sections:<br><br>Main Menu<br>Library Organizer Asset Management Editor<br>Terrain Editor<br>World Editor<br>Game Editor<br><br>Library Organizer Asset Management Editor:<br>Storyboard editor<br>Plot editor<br>Import assets.
