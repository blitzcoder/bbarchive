 Well, I got back to where I was. Took the opportunity to rewrite some 
of the core code while I was about it and it's now a lot cleaner.<br><br>I
 spent the last couple of weeks brushing up on my Lua and getting Lua 
scripts into a simple shooty game, which I had some success with.  I 
learned a lot about what to do and what not to do and I think I'll add 
it to the game in the future.<br><br>Now I'm working on a couple of 
low-level things like a resource manager. I began to write my own map 
class, but then I found the undocumented brl.map module and decided to 
investigate that instead.<br><br>Next up, and I can't really put this off any longer, is a tilemap class with collision detection. Big job, might take a while.<br> <br><br> [teamonkey] </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Disaster!</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2005-02-04)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Hard drive failure. No recent backup. Many hours of work lost etc.  :(<br><br>More
 specifically, something has managed to wipe the first bit of the drive,
 starting with the bootsector and then going on to the first few 
directories in C:, C:\BlitzMax\ being one of them to be wiped. Sounds a 
lot like a virus, so I'm doing a full system scan, disc check and 
everything else I can.<br><br>On another note, just before the terrible thing happened, I wrote a little inline profiler for Max.

 thanks to the magic of modern technology (i.e. hard disc recovery 
software) I've now managed to recover just over half of the missing 
files stored as plain text - including the latest version of the physics
 code and one of the two main source files for my Thrust-a-like thing. 
Now burning to CD...<br> <br><br> [teamonkey] </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>How did that happen?</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2005-01-14)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> <img src="8095&amp;log=1240_files/threewaythrust.html"><br><br>Wow.

 I've got an idea for a game that will require some decent but fast 2D 
physics. No further details yet, but the first thing I've been trying to
 do is to get a simple physics particle system working.<br><br>And it does. It's based on the one found at <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/resource_guide/20030121/jacobson_01.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.gamasutra.com/resource_guide/20030121/jacobson_01.shtml</a>
 (you'll need to register for free to read that - but it's well worth it
 if you're a game developer). It's extremely fast and stable, if not 
particularly accurate.<br><br>While playing about with it, I wondered 
what would happen if I strung all the particles along in one chain and 
dragged it about a bit. It turns out the effect is quite fun, so here it
 is. Please bear in mind that it's nowhere near finished yet. I think it
 looks a bit like a tapeworm, which is why it's called...<br><br><a href="http://www.tinyminions.co.uk/teamonkey/files/tapeworm.zip" target="_blank">http://www.tinyminions.co.uk/teamonkey/files/tapeworm.zip</a><br><br>That's the source, no binaries.
