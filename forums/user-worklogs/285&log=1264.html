 While fighting my way through the inner workings of DirectX I managed 
to gain quite alot of experience to advance a couple of levels.<br>With 
strengthen confidence and several potions of coffee I decided to once 
again tackle the beast that has defeated me so many times before.<br>This time I defeated the Ogre and tamed it.<br>(Been playing alot of RPGs lately *grin* )<br><br>Anyway, I wanted to try a different wrapping approach this time.<br>Wrapping
 an api or something like that is very easy, but what I find most 
troublesome is all the API-declarations that has to be made to make the 
wrapped functions available to another language.<br><br>Wrapping 
everything in Ogre3D would take a lifetime(at least for me) and by the 
time the wrapper is in a somewhat usable state, man would probably have 
moved to mars.<br><br>Currently I have wrapped enough in Ogre to create 
Entities(Models), Cameras, Lights(with shadows),SceneNodes,terrains, 
paged terrains, BSP-levels and Overlays(HUDs, text and such).<br><br>That took me about 5 hours.<br>To
 get it working in Blitz3D, Bmax, Visual Basic 6, VB.Net or any other 
language that supports API-declarations I only need to declare 7 
API-functions.<br><br>DoCommand(Function$)<br>SetIntParam(Index,Value)<br>SetFloatParam(Index,Value)<br>SetPtrParam(Index,Value)<br>GetIntParam(Index)<br>GetFloatParam(Index)<br>GetPtrParam(Index)<br><br>The application and the DLL shares a buffer of parameters.<br>Before the application tell the DLL to execute a function, the application fills in the necessary parameters in the buffer.<br>The DLL executes the function and return the results(if any) in the buffer.<br><br>This
 method introduces some overhead, but i've done some tests and the speed
 difference isn't that much and the ease of wrapping makes it worth it.<br><br>Some sample code...<br><pre class="code">
SetIntParam(0,ST_INTERIOR)
SetIntParam(1,True)
SetPtrParam(0,Null)
Command("Ogre_Init")

'This will Initialize Ogre.
'The first parameter tells it to use the BSP SceneManager
'The second parameter tells it to show the Configuration Dialog at startup
'The third parameter is a pointer to a window handle.
'If you supply a handle, Ogre will render into that window instead of creating it's own window.

</pre><br><br>To simplify the above, you can make a function like this.<br><br><pre class="code">Function Ogre_Init(SceneType,ShowDialog,ExtWin:Byte Ptr)
 SetIntParam(0,SceneType)
 SetIntParam(1,ShowDialog)
 SetPtrParam(0,ExtWin)

 a fingertip on each side of the object in the center and now the object
 is constrained to only rotate around the axis that the fingers lies on.<br>Though I haven't tested this yet, It should work.<br>I've successfully tried it in other physicsengines.<br><br>The next time I should have implemented the joints.<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Tokamak wrapper</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2003-12-10)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Most of the functions for creating rigid &amp; animated bodies are finished.<br>By the way,<br>In
