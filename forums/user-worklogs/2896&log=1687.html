 Well, my time to work on this has been seriously reduced lately as I go
 through buying a house but that doesn't mean its been sitting still.<br><br>Everything
 is working quite well so far... my next task is to do something that I 
realize now I should have done from the start and thats to 
compartmentalize the actual tile engine into its own include file.  I 
managed to mix some code together so that will be my next task.. the 
good thing is that I noticed that the bulk of the code is the editor and
 not in fact the engine.  So thats good news.   The reason it has come 
to this is that I am just now adding actors (read player first) and in 
order to test the player movement / collision code I need to have the 
engine running in game mode! yay... the fun finally begins on this 
project <br><br> <a href="http://tilemax.webs.com/apps/blog/" target="_blank">Blog</a> | <a href="http://tilemax.webs.com/" target="_blank">TileMax<br><img src="2896&amp;log=1687_files/TileMaxSplash.jpg"><br>-- Game Creation Framework --</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Moving along</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-07-14)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 TileMax is really coming together.  Its supporting 4 layers, tile-based
 multiple parallax, scrollers, and animated tiles on any layer.  <br><br>The save/load is finally working as well... I'm so close to working with actors Yay!  <br><br>But
 first I have to add tileSet to anim strip and tileset to mini-set's to 
support animated tiles, scrollers, and paralax effects better.  After 
that the fun begins! <br><br> <a href="http://tilemax.webs.com/apps/blog/" target="_blank">Blog</a> | <a href="http://tilemax.webs.com/" target="_blank">TileMax<br><img src="2896&amp;log=1687_files/TileMaxSplash.jpg"><br>-- Game Creation Framework --</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Keep on truckin</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-07-07)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 There was a short term scare where I was faced with some seriously 
boring chunks of coding.. when you do this for a hobby those serious 
boring chunks of code run the risk of project abandonment and swerving 
off on to some eye-candy rich playtime coding.  But, I managed to stave 
off the temptation and keep on truck'in with the tile mapper. <br><br>Happily,
 I have gotten through it and now have a working tile map engine that 
contains up to 4 layers per tile (parallax / scroller), 
background/collision (hidden or visible), background, &amp; foreground<br><br>Coding
 the map expansion was probably the hardest part since there is no grid 
to refer to and each tile references the next relatively.  it was an 
interesting game of logic but I managed to get it working.  Of course, 
in the end, a hundred lines of code ended up turning into about 20 after
 I went off on a strange logo-like attempt which was awful until i came 
to my senses and finally "saw the light"<br><br>Does anyone read these things? lol <br><br> <a href="http://tilemax.webs.com/apps/blog/" target="_blank">Blog</a> | <a href="http://tilemax.webs.com/" target="_blank">TileMax<br><img src="2896&amp;log=1687_files/TileMaxSplash.jpg"><br>-- Game Creation Framework --</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Going well</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-06-26)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 The new tilemap engine is coming along great.  I now have a much more 
interesting TileMap engine working.  Its array-less and uses a recursive
 drawing technique.  Its got 3 layers, the collision layer that can be 
visible or invisible, a background layer and then a foreground layer 
that will be drawn overtop the player.  Its running at a good speed 
according to several testers.  I've just finished getting the TileSet 
brush editor working which works much better than the last go... this 
method will enable brushes to be made from TileSets and Swatches made 
from the map.  Map building should be a lot of fun when its all said and
 done.   Next, I have to work on the brush pasting and merging and then 
its the save/load system.  Then I'll add a simple character to move 
around the map with just to see how it performs <br><br> <a href="http://tilemax.webs.com/apps/blog/" target="_blank">Blog</a> | <a href="http://tilemax.webs.com/" target="_blank">TileMax<br><img src="2896&amp;log=1687_files/TileMaxSplash.jpg"><br>-- Game Creation Framework --</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Transfer to BlitzMax</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-06-20)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Well I finally got my copy of BlitzMax and have been diligently 
learning the new language structure.  Very different but as I learn more
 and more I am liking what I see... MUCH more versatility and power 
under the hood but with that comes a little more complexity.  However, 
that being said I have finally gotten over the initial shock and am 
starting to work on the meat of the new version.  I hope to have 
something to show in the relatively short term but for now.. its onward 
and upward! <br><br> <a href="http://tilemax.webs.com/apps/blog/" target="_blank">Blog</a> | <a href="http://tilemax.webs.com/" target="_blank">TileMax<br><img src="2896&amp;log=1687_files/TileMaxSplash.jpg"><br>-- Game Creation Framework --</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Development Continues</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-06-13)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 So far so good.. the Tile Map engine itself is working, it displays the
 tile map at any given coordinates and is constrained to those 
coordinates... I have a routine to display the tile map using 3D sprites
 but it doesn't appear to be any faster...I retained the code but am not
 using it anymore.<br><br>The Brush system is greatly improved... now 
you can build Brushes of varying shapes.. I noticed this was necessary 
after looking at a few tile sets out there that jam the tiles together 
so you cannot pull the pieces as a square. Next I'll add a brush sorter 
for moving the tiles around in the brush to allow for tile sets that are
 not organized correctly and also mirror operations for tile sets that 
don't supply already mirrored version of tiles.<br><br>after that I'll 
be adding a character editor that will allow character sheets to be 
loaded, and the various animation sequences applied to Right move, left 
move, climb, crouch, jump etc.. as well as special moves<br><br>Onward and upward... cheers <br><br> <a href="http://tilemax.webs.com/apps/blog/" target="_blank">Blog</a> | <a href="http://tilemax.webs.com/" target="_blank">TileMax<br><img src="2896&amp;log=1687_files/TileMaxSplash.jpg"><br>-- Game Creation Framework --</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>It all Begins...</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-06-07)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Since returning to the Blitz Community, I was not sure what I wanted to
 do.. but with 3 kids in my house now I notice a lot of issues with 
games and small children.  So, I've decided to create a game for kids...<br><br>I
 decided on a TileMap 2D game, since my kids seem to be drawn to 2D 
style games more than 3D, but I wanted a platform that I can build other
 games relatively quickly after... my previous game writing experiences 
told me to create a versatile engine rather than focusing on a game 
right away per-say.<br><br>What do I have right now?<br><br>So Far I 
have a TileMap system that allows me to use multiple Tile Maps 
(divisible into 32x32 tiles).  I can create brushes from those tile maps
 and then paste them onto the game map.  There are two brush pasting 
modes, Merge and Replace.  Merge creates a new custom image based on the
 original tile with the new brush... only tiles with Alpha are merged.. 
the remaining just get replaced.  I have saving/loading working as 
well... it creates a tile map out of the custom images produced by the 
merging actions.  I also wrote a simple GUI (just the basics) that is 
nice and fast.  I also was reminded of the huge performance hit that 
using the Text command causes so I created a simple system that just 
converts the currently loaded font into an image font... I called it 
gText. I also have a poly line system for drawing barriers... those 
barriers can block the player from both sides or a single side.  Since 
no player is implemented yet... its really a mute point.. but the 
functionality is prepared...<br><br>Well, that about wraps it up for now... <br><br>Check it out on <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/skullyproductions/" target="_blank">http://sites.google.com/site/skullyproductions/</a><br><br>Next
 post I will likely have a better brush build system (right now it has 
to be square) and address the collision layer and how I want that to 
work...<br><br>Cheers. <br><br> <a href="http://tilemax.webs.com/apps/blog/" target="_blank">Blog</a> | <a href="http://tilemax.webs.com/" target="_blank">TileMax<br><img src="2896&amp;log=1687_files/TileMaxSplash.jpg"><br>-- Game Creation Framework --</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
