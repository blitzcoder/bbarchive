 just got into BlitMax fully and realized, MaxIDE pretty much blows 
unless you're doing really simple stuff.  Even then, I love how it 
"Macintizes" all of the errors (basically telling you there's a problem,
 but not wanting to hurt your little head with what the problem really 
is or pointing you in a useful direction).<br><br>Anyway, so seems that 
the only real IDE worth having is BLIDE.  So, I download it, install, 
get frustrated that I can't change all of the colours in the IDE, but 
it's 100x better than MaxIDE, so I'm all happy...<br><br>...that is until I realize I can't get any quick docs on commands (F1).  Odd... <br>Then, I realize I can't properly sync modules!  WTF?!?<br>Worst part???  Well, it seems to lock up horribly, every time I try to sync modules or check for updates.<br><br>After
 looking *everywhere* for some net settings in the IDE, I can't find it.
  No one on the net's had this problem (and the forum search function 
here is pretty pooey).<br><br>FINALLY!  I disable the stupid Norton 
Anti-Virus nonsense and viola!  I can sync mods, got F1-functionality 
and all the goodness.<br><br>I swear, if it weren't for all of the 
nastiness running around the PC, I wouldn't even have Norton's on my 
machine, at all!  So sick of it constantly bugging me to "fix" something
 by "updating".  Piss off!<br><br>Makes me want to get a Mac...<br><br>...Anyway,
 I'm happily back to coding in wonderful BlitzMax, using the lovely 
BLIDE (which I still wish I had more colour control, but I digress).<br><br>Next update should actually have some pix of what I'm working on, as soon as I can figure out how to post them. <br><br> ----------------------------------------<br>"The Biggest Thing You've Never Heard Of"<br><a href="http://www.twitchfactor.com/" target="_blank">Twitchfactor.com</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Getting started</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2008-01-17)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 So, I finally got off my ass, after lurking for some time and bought 
Blitzmax.  I'm finally gonna do a game I've been wanting to do since 
1988.  It's a top-down shooter that nowadays would be called a "boss 
rush".  <br><br>Foregoing the usual trappings of a shooter, we cut straight to the boss fight and go from there.<br><br>I've
 been making games professionally pretty steady for the past 21 years, 
but I haven't done any hardcore coding of my own for a good 10. So, this
 is not only me making one of my dream games, but also me getting my 
hands dirty again.<br><br>Fun learning (relearning) to program and not 
only relearning to program, but a new programming language.  Luckily, 
scripting for most AAA engines is largely object-oriented Basic or C 
derivative (some JavaScript), so Blitz isn't too foreign. <br><br>Should have something on the go pretty soon now, cause Blitz is a pretty great language. <br><br> ----------------------------------------<br>"The Biggest Thing You've Never Heard Of"<br><a href="http://www.twitchfactor.com/" target="_blank">Twitchfactor.com</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
