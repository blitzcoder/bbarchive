 So, a new game, of an old franchise. One that never saw the light of 
day, but briefly consumed the lifes of me and my old team-mate Evak.<br><br>What
 is state of the 2 going to do different then you say? For a start, it's
 all GIRL POWER . That's right, all characters are woman. Not really for
 any artistic reason but because i found a great 7 woman model pack with
 a load of good animations.<br><br>Evak, if you're reading, email at 
antonycoder@... - even if you dont want to work on the sequel to our 
greatest work, i havn't spoke to you in ages.<br><br>Yes I'm high. Yes I'm drunk. But so what.<br><br>The
 game is currently in a good state. It is built in blitzmax exclusively,
 using gaberial's great TV3D Wrapper. A fantastic engine/wrapper combo 
that is like discovering b3d all over again. It puts the power in the 
hands of the coder and doesn't assume anything. It's been a load of fun 
so far, just coding a 3d game again after so many months(years?) coding 
commercial applications.<br><br>This game will use my soon to be 
released kick ass scripting language for blitzmax(Wrote 100% in bmax of 
course), so will feature many scripted gameplay sequences.<br><br>I'm 
tempted to do multiplayer but honestly, all I want to do is tell a 
story. Multiplayer is a nice sales point, but it's not art. at least no 
multiplayer thus far has been. I'm sure in the right hands and minds 
such a game could transcend the genre. <br><br>It wont be done by EA, 
that's for sure. it'll be done by someone like you, or like me,  someone
 who makes games to make art. Not to make a quick buck.<br><br>Although 
money is a fine incentive. I wouldn't have been coding on wildfire for 
over 10 months if i didn't find money a good incentive to development. 
But there is a time and place for true art. True art in the medium of 
games is actually a combination of many artforms. from story narrative 
to music to touch to interaction.<br><br>This is what SOTA2P0 will be 
all about. It won't bow down to the alter of the lowest common 
denominator. it will make you work for your rewards, but those rewards 
will be epic. <br><br>Evak, again, if you're reading contact me. Let's 
make a great game together like in the old days. i'm drunk and nostalgic
 atm, but fuck it. a good team with a good idea is worth more than a 
thoushand...i don't know how to finish that sentence. (takes a toke)<br><br>So
 STATE of the ARt 2 - Trailer coming soon. The music will blow your 
socks off. Too few games place importance on music. look at ea and their
 god awful ea-trax system. any game that panders to the populist ideal 
rather than searching for true resonece within is a game not worth 
owning. and no ea games are worth owning.<br><br>check back tomorrow for some screenshots. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
