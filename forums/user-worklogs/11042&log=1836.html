 We had a meeting Saturday (Nov 26, 2011) I only planned for it to last 
around an hour but we ended up working for around 3 hours on different 
design concepts.  The requirements for the story/game are that it have 
strong educational, social, or moral value and the player should have 
learned something by the end of the game.  This is what we came up with:<br><br>An
 environmentally themed game with a world that has been absolutely 
trashed by humans so much so that the humans have all disappeared and  
you (a robot) are left to survive in this mess.  You then find the plans
 to a rocket ship hidden in your boss's office and decide to give up and
 escape this wreck.  Your goal is to collect the parts to the rocket by 
solving various physics puzzles to traverse the trash covered landscape.
  After collecting all the parts you build a ship to finally escape this
 mess.  As you fly off into space you realize you have just run away 
from the problem, not fixed it and you have nowhere to go (its space!) 
and as memories flash back on the screen you realize it wasn't such a 
bad place after all and maybe you should have stayed to help out.<br><br>We
 then had a relatively short meeting this past Monday (Nov 28, 2011) 
where we worked on a general concept for the main character and revised 
the story a bit.  Today, (Nov 30, 2011) we had a TSA meeting.  The main 
purpose this meeting served was to inform everyone of where we were in 
the project and to figure out what was going to happen as far as how 
many people were allowed on the team.  Apparently there was a limit and 
we didn't find out the limit before I already had a team of 9 together. 
 The limit is six so unfortunately I had to cut one person who has not 
shown any interest in coming to the meetings so far and we had to decide
 which two people will be going as 'guests' but fortunately guests can 
still contribute to the project. I also started programming the 
structure for the game and we started searching for a good boned 
animation tool for the future.  The Next meeting should be this Saturday
 (Dec 3, 2011)  I plan on having a decent amount of code written by that
 time and we will work on figuring out how to integrate the different 
styles of art being done for the game as well.  We may also make an 
official storyboard for the notebook we have to present along with the 
game but right now the most important thing is getting the game into a 
playable state. <br><br> ______________________________<br><br>-NTG<br><br><a href="http://naillproductions.synthasite.com/" target="_blank">http://naillproductions.synthasite.com</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Day 1</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2011-11-21)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Our first meeting was held last Wednesday. (Nov 16, 2011) At this 
meeting we discussed some different concepts for the game keeping in 
mind that the game had to be educational or teach something of social or
 educational value.  We came up with two good ideas despite the meeting 
being cut short and postponed the vote on the game design until the next
 full meeting where we will have more ideas ready to be presented and 
explained.  Our next meeting is tomorrow after school (Nov 22, 2011) and
 it will be an especially short meeting because we don't have a room to 
meet in and the library closes at 4:00.  At this meeting we will vote on
 a basic layout for how the game will work and if we have time start on 
the story and create a "plan of work" which is a requirement for the 
competition.  I plan on getting a group of people together over 
thanksgiving break so that we can finish the plan of work and write out a
 general storyboard. <br><br> ______________________________<br><br>-NTG<br><br><a href="http://naillproductions.synthasite.com/" target="_blank">http://naillproductions.synthasite.com</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
