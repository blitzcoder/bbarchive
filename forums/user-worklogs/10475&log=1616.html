Here's the breakdown of what's happened in the last month.<br><br>1.
 Some enemies now shoot visible projectiles that are an exact match to 
the player's bullets.  Speed is the same, but time between shots is 
higher, as is damage.<br><br>2. Added a death animation when the player dies.<br><br>3. Added a splash screen at startup.<br><br>4. Added about 30 enemies to levels 4 and 6.<br><br>5.
 Deathmatch level at level 5 is activated.  The player has to kill a 
certain number of enemies before he can reach the portal to the next 
level.<br><br>6. Added levels 6 through 12, although enemies have not been placed yet.<br><br>7.
 Improved enemy ai.  Most enemies are now presented with multiple 
choices, and some have more than one weapon to choose from.  <br><br>8. 
Added various "named" enemies that may drop special power-ups.  These 
special power-ups are dropped at roughly 1 out of 500 chance.<br><br>9. Friendly-fire is allowed.  I purposely left out a check to see if the enemy has another enemy inbetween him and the player.<br><br>10.
 I will not be releasing another demo, only the finished product when 
complete.  Some people seem to think they need to release a "demo" every
 time they change 1 variable... not me.  I hope to have it completed 
within about 2 weeks. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Tweaks</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2008-06-30)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> 1: Added Re-recoil.  The gun now comes back down on it's own after a shot.<br><br>2: The endgame function was commented out in the compiled version, so it has been uncommented!<br><br>3: The compiled version also didn't have the ranking function enabed either, so this has been enabled.<br><br>4:
 It seems the purple spheres are a bit too tough, I will probably 
decrease either their hp a bit or their attack modifier to make them a 
little easier to kill before they kill you.<br><br>5: Red spheres only 
melee, so I increased their damage by 10x!  Why?  These are so easy to 
kill that they shouldn't be able to get to the player!  <br><br>6: All 
enemies now have a random number of hit points.  Tougher enemies will 
always have tougher hit points.  Example:  Reds have anywhere from 3-7 
hp, while yellows will have something like 6-12.<br><br>7. Left\right recoil was doubled, but still slight compared to upwards recoil.<br><br>8.
 The last 2 enemies in level 3 were changed to white spheres instead of 
purple.  They are basically the same thing as machine gunners with 
lessened attack damage.  Why?  I couldn't get past them, easy as that.<br><br>Here is the newest zip:<br><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?35e42h4cwml" target="_blank">http://www.mediafire.com/?35e42h4cwml</a> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
