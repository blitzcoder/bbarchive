I'm on my way...<br><br><img src="547&amp;log=1319_files/4496399.jpg"><br><br>Get in... No pushing...<br><br><img src="547&amp;log=1319_files/4530581.jpg"><br><br>Stop fighting in the back!<br><br><img src="547&amp;log=1319_files/2965204.jpg"><br><br>You'll all just going to have to get along... it's a tight squeeze!<br><br><img src="547&amp;log=1319_files/2854457.jpg"><br><br>The
 only reason I'm showing this is because it was actually a very complex 
bit of code to get the guys to run to pick a side of the helicopter, get
 to the bases of the ramp, run up them, get inside, and then stand in a 
specifc place based on how many people are already in the helicopter... 
Oh and not to try to get in if there are already 6 people in there. And 
once they're in they parent themselves to the helicopter too...<br><br>Yes I know they don't have faces yet... and I know they don't have shadows yet!<br><br>Anyway...
 In the game you won't actually be getting anything like this close to 
them, but I thought I'd show that they all get into the helicopter 
properly as opposed to just going inside and disappearing! You can 
physically fit 6 people inside... 7 if you count the pilot... even if it
 is a bit of a squeeze!<br><br>Oh... and at the bottom of the last pic 
you can see my single surface text thing... all the weird characters you
 see there are all part of the cool drawing / undrawing of the text, it 
sort of decodes itself onto the screen which looks funky. And it's all a
 neat self contained bit of code so I just write:<pre class="code">NewText("PRISONER "+onboardcount+" ON BOARD",3000)</pre>And
 this will display the message "PRISONER 5 ON BOARD" for 3 seconds, 
scroll up any existing messages out of the way and do all the funky 
decoding onto the screen, all I need to do is call<pre class="code">UpdateText()</pre> in the main loop. <br><br> <a href="http://www.mentalillusion.co.uk/" target="_blank">Cheers Rob</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>And so it begins</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-02-26)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Well, I've have a few requests asking me to do a worklog for this so here's my first attempt at it...<br><br>The
 Helicopter game started off life as a vertical scrolling shoot'em up 
however, things quick progress into a full 3D world. The idea was to 
make a game that plays like a 2D game but still has the 3D element to 
make it feel fairly realistic...<br><br>Having played with blitz 
terrains I quickly realised I would have to write my own terrain 
system... The problem with creating your own terrain system means you 
have to write a lot more code, however, you get additional flexibility 
and functionality, obviously an editor had to be written too.<br><br>After a few attempts I came up with this as a final result...<br><br>The
 terrain is 2km². It is made up of 256 meshes (16x16), each mesh is 
32x32 quads, each quad 4units². 1 unit = 1 metre, therefore 4 * 32 * 16 =
 2048 metres. Or around 2km. Not huge, but big enough. Each 4unit quad 
has a 256x256 texture on it which effectivly gives you a detail level of
 131072 x 131072 pixels.<br>Then on top of that it's all vertex lit.<br><br>It
 starts with a 513x513 grey scale height map (0-255), the editor then 
smooths this into a 16bit heightmap (0-65535) then it's flattened, 
coloured or adjusted based on the tile that is placed between the 
points.<br><br>There's 3 smoothing passes and 3 flattening passes to 
make the roads flat, as well as a beach pass to make a severe drop when 
it hits water level so you don't get Z buffer fighting at the waters 
edge.<br><br>The editor then exports the new 16bit heightmap information as well as the tile information (including rotation of the tile).<br><br>The
 game then loads this data and creates multiple meshes based on this 
data. Creates brushes as it finds new textures and creates new surfaces 
per mesh as<br>it needs them. This works out pretty effeciant on the 
surface count per mesh as you rarely have more than 3 surfaces per mesh.
 This allows you to have a varied<br>tile set but still keep the surface count down if you keep the meshes far enough apart so they can't 'see' each other.<br><br>Got all that?<br><br>The first hit looked like this:<br><img src="547&amp;log=1319_files/4543337.jpg"><br><br>This
 then progress to using grey scale textures (or very diluted colour) and
 colouring the terrain using vertex colours, this meant that you could 
add variation to the terrain without added textures.<br><br><img src="547&amp;log=1319_files/4842078.jpg"><br><br>At this point all object placement was just random as the editor didn't have any kind of placement stuff in it yet...<br><br>Bad
 guys were added... Helicopters, Jeeps, and Tanks. This also meant an 
auto aim system had to be written so they could actually hit you, 
likewise as the game is 3rd person your gun auto aims too. This makes 
life much easier from the player point of view and I think more fun.<br><br>I
 used Noel Cowers Lotus Particle system too as my particle system was 
crap. This gave the game some of the necessary fx to make it look 
pretty.<br><br><img src="547&amp;log=1319_files/1671253.jpg"><br><br>3 
types of weapons are currently in, Cannon, Shell and Missile. This will 
probably increase as time goes on however, this does for the time being.<br><br>Next
 to come in the game was some kind of story... OK... I didn't come up 
with one, however, the idea of having to rescue people was a pretty good
 one so I added POWs who you would spring from prisions.<br><br><img src="547&amp;log=1319_files/4625348.jpg"><br><br>The sky was looking poor... This needed a face lift...<br>The water was looking poor... This needed a face lift...<br><br>So I gave them a face lift!<br><br><img src="547&amp;log=1319_files/sky%2520and%2520water.jpg"><br><br>It
 was time to add object placement into the editor... Needed to organise 
where things were and see how much it could take without getting severe 
FPS drops...<br><br>So each object has a definition file, looks something like this:<pre class="code">&lt;mesh&gt;Tree.b3d&lt;/mesh&gt;
&lt;type&gt;static&lt;/type&gt;
&lt;xsize&gt;8&lt;/xsize&gt;
&lt;ysize&gt;10&lt;/ysize&gt;
&lt;zsize&gt;8&lt;/zsize&gt;
&lt;health&gt;10&lt;/health&gt;
&lt;death&gt;fall&lt;/death&gt;
&lt;sway&gt;1&lt;/sway&gt;
&lt;randomise&gt;1&lt;/randomise&gt;</pre>The editor and game use this 
file, the editor uses it to make the boxes on the screen the right size 
for level creation. The game uses it to do pretty much everything else!<br><br>The actual level object file looks something like this:<pre class="code">&lt;OBJECT&gt;&lt;ID&gt;1&lt;/ID&gt;&lt;TYPE&gt;static&lt;/TYPE&gt;&lt;NAME&gt;radio&lt;/NAME&gt;&lt;X&gt;453&lt;/X&gt;&lt;Z&gt;229&lt;/Z&gt;&lt;ROT&gt;45&lt;/ROT&gt;&lt;/OBJECT&gt;
&lt;OBJECT&gt;&lt;ID&gt;2&lt;/ID&gt;&lt;TYPE&gt;static&lt;/TYPE&gt;&lt;NAME&gt;radio&lt;/NAME&gt;&lt;X&gt;431&lt;/X&gt;&lt;Z&gt;236&lt;/Z&gt;&lt;ROT&gt;90&lt;/ROT&gt;&lt;/OBJECT&gt;
&lt;OBJECT&gt;&lt;ID&gt;3&lt;/ID&gt;&lt;TYPE&gt;vehicle&lt;/TYPE&gt;&lt;NAME&gt;tank&lt;/NAME&gt;&lt;X&gt;482&lt;/X&gt;&lt;Z&gt;169&lt;/Z&gt;&lt;ROT&gt;90&lt;/ROT&gt;&lt;PARENT&gt;51&lt;/PARENT&gt;&lt;/OBJECT&gt;
etc
etc</pre>So when an object is loaded it checks out the definition file for that object and loads the right mesh etc etc.<br><br>The
 object definition file can be extended as much as necessary, it already
 accounts for special types of death (for example trees fall over rather
 than blow up!).<br><br>Likewise the level objects file will include 
scripting for what to do when they die... or maybe this will be in the 
object definition... not sure yet... and example would be when a prision
 is destoryed it will spawn a damaged prison and a bunch of 
prisioners... or maybe a prisioner spawner... or something... <br><br>As
 you may have noticed the type is denormalised into the level object 
file, this is because static objects are delt with in a single function 
and vehicles and other things that I've not though of yet are delt with 
in other functions. If I read the object defintion file every time to 
get the type I'd have to open and close files loads, this just makes 
life a little simpler. Obviously once the respective function is called 
with the object name it will go off and read the definition file within 
the correct function.<br><br>The update of the sky gave me an idea of a 
sort of global illumination thing going on, so on the load of the skybox
 the general hue of the sky is calculated... This then affects the 
colour of the terrain and objects on it. This means you can get some 
cool fx going on...<br><br><img src="547&amp;log=1319_files/181307.jpg"><br><img src="547&amp;log=1319_files/310131.jpg"><br><br>I
 also adjusted the shadows so as things get higher the shadow gets 
bigger and moves away in the opposite direction of the light source, 
this is a complete cheat, but looks quite nice!<br><br>The helicopter 
now has gained doors on the sides, this is mainly a cheat for getting 
the prisioners on board, the doors fold down and create ramps either 
side of the helicopter. This means that the prisoner in theory can just 
run up the ramp and not have to do any complex climbing into the 
helicopter.<br><br><img src="547&amp;log=1319_files/Landed.jpg"><br><br>So that brings you up to date! Phew!<br><br>Here's some pictures of explosions!<br><br><img src="547&amp;log=1319_files/7176443.jpg"><br><br><img src="547&amp;log=1319_files/6966044.jpg"><br><br><img src="547&amp;log=1319_files/7709310.jpg"> <br><br> <a href="http://www.mentalillusion.co.uk/" target="_blank">Cheers Rob</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
