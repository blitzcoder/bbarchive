 The biggest addition, and also the most requested feature in testing, 
is that the game now saves on exit. Testers would press escape thinking 
it had a function other than instant quit and would as a result lose 
their game. Now the game is saved exactly as you left it and no matter 
how you exited the game. The code for this is a little unrefined at the 
moment as I just dump the whole game memory to file and restore it when 
the app is restarted, but I'll clean it all up after I'm satisfied it's 
working properly in all situations.<br><br>I've managed to rope the talented <a href="http://www.jackmenhorn.com/" target="_blank">Jack Menhorn</a>
 in to do the music. Surprisingly there was a lot of interest from 
composers wanting to add their talents to the game, but as soon as Jack 
showed an interest I signed him up.  With Jack on board I thought it was
 time to finalise the music player. It was pretty much complete, but it 
needed better transitions when one track interrupts another and other 
minor changes. It's all around a more solid piece of code now.<br><br>One
 issue flagged up in testing was that players were still sometimes 
accidentally clicking the wrong tile when trying to attack monsters. 
This popped up last time as well, and I thought I'd solved it by making 
spaces with monsters in 'attract' the cursor. This obviously wasn't 
enough so I decided to finally put this problem to bed with a couple of 
major additions. The first is a floor grid. You can now, if you wish, 
have a grid overlaid on to the floor to show you beyond all doubt where 
each tile is. The second is a magnifier. You can now zoom the gameplay 
area in or out so everything is much easier to click and see. You can 
also use it to zoom out and see the whole level on the screen all at 
once. And finally I made it easier to find and use the full screen 
option. Some of the testers didn't understand that increasing the window
 size would eventually make the game go into full screen so now you can 
also use the shortcuts [cmd+F] or [F11].<br><br>There have also been 
plenty of more minor additions. Dungeon shapes are now implemented. 
These are the overall shape of the dungeon, its outline if you will. 
This means dungeon levels can be massive and sprawling or small and 
compact, as well as different shapes such as a round wizard's tower or 
skull shaped castle. The item preview now shows if the item is raising 
or lowering stats by colouring them green or red. I've nerfed swift 
items. originally items with swiftness just wouldn't have any other 
bonuses and so the thinking was that taking up a slot was their 
downside. It seems like that wasn't enough so now all items with 
swiftness will also contain some form of curse/penalty. Hopefully that 
will balance it. And finally I've added level feelings when something 
special or unusual is present on the level. I may also add a level 
difficulty indicator to this as well, but I just need a reliable way to 
calculate a level's difficulty.<br><br>Website <a href="http://www.hackslashloot.com/" target="_blank">HackSlashLoot.com</a><br>Twitter <b>@</b><a href="http://www.twitter.com/OddballDave" target="_blank"><b>OddballDave</b></a> <br><br> DaveW<br><br><img src="300&amp;log=1801_files/smallblob.gif"><b>PhysLite[</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/phys.html" target="_blank">Info</a><b>]<img src="300&amp;log=1801_files/smallblob.gif">ODD.mod[</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/mods/odd2dmodule.zip" target="_blank">Odd2D.mod</a><b>][</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/temp/aspectmodule.zip" target="_blank">Aspect.mod</a><b>][</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/temp/asciifontmodule.zip" target="_blank">AsciiFont.mod</a><b>]</b><br>"When you're the last man standing and still packing nukes you don't need experience points."<i> - Brian Van Hoose</i> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>An enchantment by any other name</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2011-04-22)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Added the enchantment name generator. Before all enchanted items were 
simply labeled enchanted, but this addition gives enchanted items a 
richer set of names. This is only superficial and has no real game 
effect. It's also a little sparse at the moment, but there'll be plenty 
of time to flesh it out later. I only wanted to get the code in and 
working for now.<br><br>I finally succumbed and added keyboard controls.
 Standard roguelike keys(yuck!) are supported as well as numpad and 
cursor keys. The only things that don't have keybindings yet are the 
game options and title screen. If I was making this game just for myself
 I wouldn't have bothered with keyboard controls as HSL is designed to 
be played with the mouse, but I understand that others prefer keys. Also
 some of the testers wanted to use a mix of keys for movement, and mouse
 for targeting.<br><br>Website <a href="http://www.hackslashloot.com/" target="_blank">HackSlashLoot.com</a><br>Twitter <b>@</b><a href="http://www.twitter.com/OddballDave" target="_blank"><b>OddballDave</b></a> <br><br> DaveW<br><br><img src="300&amp;log=1801_files/smallblob.gif"><b>PhysLite[</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/phys.html" target="_blank">Info</a><b>]<img src="300&amp;log=1801_files/smallblob.gif">ODD.mod[</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/mods/odd2dmodule.zip" target="_blank">Odd2D.mod</a><b>][</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/temp/aspectmodule.zip" target="_blank">Aspect.mod</a><b>][</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/temp/asciifontmodule.zip" target="_blank">AsciiFont.mod</a><b>]</b><br>"When you're the last man standing and still packing nukes you don't need experience points."<i> - Brian Van Hoose</i> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Wizard, I choose you!</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2011-04-18)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 I've actually been doing a lot of bug fixing and optimisation this 
week. Not really had a lot of bugs to fix during development so far, but
 as it is becoming a much larger, and complex, beast they have started 
to creep in. I have had time for a few new features though.<br><br>The 
most requested feature from testing was to be able to select your 
character. This is now in, as is selecting the quest you wish to embark 
on. When finished there will be three characters available from the 
start with the others becoming available depending upon the number of 
times you have died. These 'unlockable' characters are more powerful 
than the original three so having their availability dependant upon the 
amount of times you die seems the sensible way to do things.<br><br>As I
 mentioned in my last log tile spaces can now contain more than one 
item. This presented a problem as it was difficult to tell when a space 
had more than one item in it. I have solved this by having the items 
expand into a stack when you hover the cursor over the tile. I am also 
contemplating having monsters drop there entire inventory instead of 
just the one item as it now. This may become annoying for the player 
though as there'll be a lot more item shuffling involved. I'll probably 
try it and see how it feels.<br><br>Artifacts are now retainable from 
game to game. Each quest will contain one or more artifacts. These items
 are more powerful or unusual than enchanted items, and after being 
found once they will be included(randomly) in your inventory for other 
quests. Artifacts won't be dropped by ordinary monsters they will be 
reserved for bosses and the like.<br><br>Finally I finished adding the 
secondary effects for the special damage types. I may add some more, but
 I'll wait to see if inspiration hits. Either way I'm more than happy 
with the current ones. <br><br> DaveW<br><br><img src="300&amp;log=1801_files/smallblob.gif"><b>PhysLite[</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/phys.html" target="_blank">Info</a><b>]<img src="300&amp;log=1801_files/smallblob.gif">ODD.mod[</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/mods/odd2dmodule.zip" target="_blank">Odd2D.mod</a><b>][</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/temp/aspectmodule.zip" target="_blank">Aspect.mod</a><b>][</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/temp/asciifontmodule.zip" target="_blank">AsciiFont.mod</a><b>]</b><br>"When you're the last man standing and still packing nukes you don't need experience points."<i> - Brian Van Hoose</i> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>And the results are in</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2011-04-09)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Been working on HSL a lot this week so I've split this post into two 
sections. If your not interested in what testing taught me skip to the 
second part.<br><br><b>It was a testing time...</b><br>So the response 
to my call for testers was phenomenal. Got tons of useful feedback, and 
I've been working through the points raised all week. I'd like to share 
some observations from the testing process if nobody minds.<br><br><b>It's a scary world</b>
 I was extremely nervous about showing the game off to complete 
strangers as I had no idea what the reaction would be. I needn't have 
worried the general mood from the testers was a positive one.<br><b>I'm stupid, but I already knew that</b>
 One thing I was certain would happen was that I would have missed some 
really obvious issue, and sure enough there were a few slap my forehead 
moments when the responses came in. As I work on the game almost every 
day I'm extremely familiar with the game and therefore have no 
perspective as a new comer to the game. This was one of the most useful 
aspects of the testing, and I appreciated that a few of the testers 
tried the game without reading the 'How to' guide first.<br><b>Carrot before stick</b>
 Feedback that started with the positives felt more constructive than 
feedback that had the negatives first. I know that both styles are just 
as useful as each other but the beginning set the tone for the rest of 
the feedback. This is something that I will certainly be more mindful of
 in future when I give feedback to others.<br><b>You can't please everyone</b>
 This is important to remember. A lot of the feedback I got was 
contradictory, one person thought some part was good, another would 
think it was bad. An important aspect of sorting through the feedback 
was assessing what was due to personal taste and what was due to a 
design issue.<br><b>Getting noticed</b> Twitter was great for recruiting
 testers, and I was helped by the 2 Girls 1 Game preview. Next time I 
may consider using other social networking or tech solutions that allow 
for better two-way dialog with testers.<br><br><a href="http://twitpic.com/4ihyqh" target="_blank"><img src="300&amp;log=1801_files/4ihyqh.html"></a><br><i>The new 'distressed' GUI and the 'tool tip' styled hint at the bottom</i><br><br><b>And the result</b><br>I
 did actually work on the game a little too. The biggest change is that 
each tile can now contain more than one item. My original intention was 
to keep the game simplified, and one item per tile seemed like a good 
way to keep it that way. Enough people found this frustrating to warrant
 a rethink. The most compelling argument was having a potion dropped but
 then killing a monster over it and having the potion obliterated by the
 newly dropped item. This unfairly punishes the player for killing two 
monsters.<br><br>I added some of the damage secondary effects. Each 
damage type(fire,lightning,etc) has a secondary effect if you deal that 
damage and/or are resistant to it. I'm keeping these effects 
undocumented so the player can discover them as they play. Although when
 a secondary effect is triggered it is noted in the turn log so as not 
to confuse the player as to why it happened. For those who don't mind 
spoilers here's a taster <b>*SPOILER*</b><font class="tiny">Life Steal(Necrotic) killing a monster with necrotic damage will steal some of the life force giving the player a health boost</font>.<b>*SPOILER*</b><br><br>The
 other additions are all to do with usability. This was a key focus of 
testing and helped tremendously. I now have 'tool tip' style hints when 
hovering the mouse over stats and icons. As the name suggests hints give
 the player a sense of what each thing means without going into detail. 
They are aimed at the player who doesn't like to read help files, or 
needs their memory jogging. The tile cursor got a revamp meaning it is 
now more obvious when a feature is usable. Also you can now hover the 
cursor over an item to see how it would affect you stats. Creatures on 
the minimap now flash to distinguish them from other elements. Finally 
there have been other minor graphical and layout changes. Most notable 
of which is the new icons for swift and shadeform. Well shadeform still 
uses the same icon, but now it pulses in time with the player. <br><br> DaveW<br><br><img src="300&amp;log=1801_files/smallblob.gif"><b>PhysLite[</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/phys.html" target="_blank">Info</a><b>]<img src="300&amp;log=1801_files/smallblob.gif">ODD.mod[</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/mods/odd2dmodule.zip" target="_blank">Odd2D.mod</a><b>][</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/temp/aspectmodule.zip" target="_blank">Aspect.mod</a><b>][</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/temp/asciifontmodule.zip" target="_blank">AsciiFont.mod</a><b>]</b><br>"When you're the last man standing and still packing nukes you don't need experience points."<i> - Brian Van Hoose</i> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Sound stuff</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2011-04-03)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Been working exclusively on sound this week. The sound effects are 
procedurally generated at runtime using Brucey's wrapping of DrPetter's 
sfxr code. That means no two sword hits(or footfalls, or bow twangs, 
etc) sound the same. The sound generation code is all in, but not all 
the sound effect profiles are done yet. The music code is in too, but 
I'm just using placeholder tracks now. Music isn't going to be a major 
feature of the game, but I do want to use it as a cue for various game 
states and situations.

 I decided it was time to rework the enemy AI to make the enemies 
tactics a little less predictable. I ripped out the old code and rewrote
 it from scratch, and it's turned out great. The enemy's behaviour is 
formulated based upon three elements, the creature's intelligence, the 
creature's combat prowess, and the current situation.<br><br>There are four levels of creature intelligence, none/animal, dumb/bloodlust, normal, and smart.<br>- <i>None/animal</i>
 is for animals, like giant rats, or creature with no intelligence at 
all, like zombies and golems. Creatures with this intelligence will 
usual charge when attacked or threatened.<br>- <i>Dumb/bloodlust</i> is 
for unintelligent monsters, like Trolls, or bloodthirsty creatures, like
 barbarians. Dumb isn't much of a step up from none, but dumb monsters 
will alert comrades and formulate tactics with them, like cutting of the
 players retreat.<br>- <i>Normal</i> is the most common intellect level 
which most enemies will have. Normal has a far greater range of tactics,
 and can even decide to pickup objects from fallen comrades if it will 
improve their situation. Other tactics are hanging back and using ranged
 weapons, or retreating to gather more help.<br>- <i>Smart</i> is 
reserved for the most intelligent characters you'll encounter, mainly 
bosses and their kind. It isn't much different to normal, but those 
small variances make all the difference. Smart monsters are more 
interested in self preservation than the others and will order comrades 
to wear down the player before endangering themselves.<br><br>The 
creature's combat prowess is based upon its skill when compared to the 
player. Enemies weaker than the player are more likely to hesitate, hang
 back or even retreat. Whereas monsters stronger than the player will be
 braver and more likely to engage the player quickly, even if that means
 the player will get the first strike.<br><br>The final aspect, 
situation, is based solely on the situation the player and enemies find 
themselves in at that moment in time. For example a cornered enemy isn't
 going to hang back when faced with a player armed with a bow, he'd just
 be pelted with arrows. He's more likely to charge the player.<br><br>Using
 these three factors the enemy have a rich arsenal of behaviours that 
throw up some interesting combats. Here's a few examples from my 
testing, two goblins with normal intelligence aided by two giant rats 
with animal intellect. One goblin sports a bow so he hung back and laid 
down covering fire, the other equipped with a longsword hung back just 
long enough to let the two giant rats take the first few hits before 
joining the fray.<br><br>Another example, I opened a door to reveal a 
goblin rager, with bloodlust, who immediately charged at me. I wasn't 
too worried as I easily outmatched him, but unbeknownst to me he had 
alerted an unarmed hobgoblin, normal intellect, who wasn't in my view. 
The fight with the rager only lasted a couple of turns but in that time 
the hobgoblin had managed to alert more enemies to my presence. Before I
 realised what had happened there where now about ten enemies bearing 
down on me and my situation needless to say had become hopeless.<br><br>Wow!
 That turned into a wall of text. As you can probably gather I'm quite 
pleased with how the enemy AI worked out. In other news I've also been 
working on the visual queues for the various actions characters can 
perform. Attack animations have been in for a while, but other things 
like, item pick ups, drinking potions, etc. had no visual queue to show 
they had happened. They're not all in yet but I've got most of it done. 
I've been trying to avoid using particle effects for any of it, but some
 of my visual effects aren't up to standard so I my have to relent and 
have a bespoke few particle effects. Next I might have a go at sound, 
although I haven't even considered what I'm going to do for music yet.<br><br>Website <a href="http://www.hackslashloot.com/" target="_blank">HackSlashLoot.com</a><br>Twitter <b>@</b><a href="http://www.twitter.com/OddballDave" target="_blank"><b>OddballDave</b></a> <br><br> DaveW<br><br><img src="300&amp;log=1801_files/smallblob.gif"><b>PhysLite[</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/phys.html" target="_blank">Info</a><b>]<img src="300&amp;log=1801_files/smallblob.gif">ODD.mod[</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/mods/odd2dmodule.zip" target="_blank">Odd2D.mod</a><b>][</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/temp/aspectmodule.zip" target="_blank">Aspect.mod</a><b>][</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/temp/asciifontmodule.zip" target="_blank">AsciiFont.mod</a><b>]</b><br>"When you're the last man standing and still packing nukes you don't need experience points."<i> - Brian Van Hoose</i> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Resource management</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2011-03-17)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 The big addition since my last log is a dynamic asset loader, which can
 handle realtime alterations to the games resources. The realtime aspect
 won't really come into play outside of my testing, but does mean the 
game is more than capable of handling post release asset updates, 
additions and changes. This also nails down the games file 
structure/handling ready for creating releasable versions for testing. 
The other changes to the game are mainly internal optimisations and 
general code tidying.<br><br>On the subject of releasing a test build, the first round of testing will probably be organised through my Twitter account(<b>@</b><a href="http://www.twitter.com/OddballDave" target="_blank"><b>OddballDave</b></a>), so keep an eye out there if you're interested in getting in on the the first public build. <br><br> DaveW<br><br><img src="300&amp;log=1801_files/smallblob.gif"><b>PhysLite[</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/phys.html" target="_blank">Info</a><b>]<img src="300&amp;log=1801_files/smallblob.gif">ODD.mod[</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/mods/odd2dmodule.zip" target="_blank">Odd2D.mod</a><b>][</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/temp/aspectmodule.zip" target="_blank">Aspect.mod</a><b>][</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/temp/asciifontmodule.zip" target="_blank">AsciiFont.mod</a><b>]</b><br>"When you're the last man standing and still packing nukes you don't need experience points."<i> - Brian Van Hoose</i> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Procedural item gen continued</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2011-02-25)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">

 I feel like I've finally got a system I like for the procedural item 
generator. The old version felt too random and was easily identifiable 
as a random algorithm. The new version is much more discrete, and makes 
much better choices when allocating magic/special items. I've achieved 
this by using a tagging system. Anything that request an item from the 
generator will pass a set of 'tags' with the request. Some of the tags 
are auto-generated and some are specified by the dungeon theme. These 
tags tell the generator preferable item properties. When the generator 
needs to make a choice during the creation process it first checks the 
tags for any preferred properties and then favours those choices over 
the others. An example might be when a weapon is needed for the wizard 
to wield the 'magicuser' tag will be used, the generator now knows to 
remove any options that a wizard cannot use. The tags are extremely 
versatile and can be used for a wide variety of filtering, not just for 
character class. There are ~100 recognised tags at the moment and I'm 
far from finished, I'd say the item generator is about 50% done.<br><br>I
 did get a little sidetracked whilst figuring out the item generator, 
and added some extra gameplay features that I hadn't originally planned 
for. Hopefully this isn't the start of feature creep and I can stay 
focused now that I have a better idea of the direction I'm going. <br><br> DaveW<br><br><img src="300&amp;log=1801_files/smallblob.gif"><b>PhysLite[</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/phys.html" target="_blank">Info</a><b>]<img src="300&amp;log=1801_files/smallblob.gif">ODD.mod[</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/mods/odd2dmodule.zip" target="_blank">Odd2D.mod</a><b>][</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/temp/aspectmodule.zip" target="_blank">Aspect.mod</a><b>][</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/temp/asciifontmodule.zip" target="_blank">AsciiFont.mod</a><b>]</b><br>"When you're the last man standing and still packing nukes you don't need experience points."<i> - Brian Van Hoose</i> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Queued movement</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2011-02-15)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> <img src="300&amp;log=1801_files/c7.html">
 I was supposed to be working on the magic/special item generation, but I
 didn't like how it was turning out so I've put that on the back burner 
whilst I think how best to implement it. I did however work on queueing 
the players actions so that the player can get things done with the 
fewest amount of clicks possible. Now you can click on anywhere you've 
been and if it's still accessible then your man will make his own way 
there. This means if you find yourself having to backtrack it's much 
less of a chore. As the game works with a limited/small viewport I've 
also allowed for the player to click on the minimap to achieve the same 
effect. The queued events are interrupted if a new monster appears or if
 the player is attacked. <br><br> DaveW<br><br><img src="300&amp;log=1801_files/smallblob.gif"><b>PhysLite[</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/phys.html" target="_blank">Info</a><b>]<img src="300&amp;log=1801_files/smallblob.gif">ODD.mod[</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/mods/odd2dmodule.zip" target="_blank">Odd2D.mod</a><b>][</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/temp/aspectmodule.zip" target="_blank">Aspect.mod</a><b>][</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/temp/asciifontmodule.zip" target="_blank">AsciiFont.mod</a><b>]</b><br>"When you're the last man standing and still packing nukes you don't need experience points."<i> - Brian Van Hoose</i> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>The story so far</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2011-01-28)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> <img src="300&amp;log=1801_files/hsltitle2.html"><br><br><a href="http://www.hackslashloot.com/media/hslscreen01.png" target="_blank"><img src="300&amp;log=1801_files/hslthumb01.html"></a> <a href="http://www.hackslashloot.com/media/hslscreen02.png" target="_blank"><img src="300&amp;log=1801_files/hslthumb02.html"></a> <a href="http://www.hackslashloot.com/media/hslscreen03.png" target="_blank"><img src="300&amp;log=1801_files/hslthumb03.html"></a> <a href="http://www.hackslashloot.com/media/hslscreen04.png" target="_blank"><img src="300&amp;log=1801_files/hslthumb04.html"></a><br><br><img src="300&amp;log=1801_files/c1.html">
 This has been in development for a little while, and the few people who
 follow me on Twitter may have already seen some teasing screenshots 
already. But now I thought it was time to start a DevLog as I really 
start to ramp up development on this.<br><br><b>The story so far</b><br><img src="300&amp;log=1801_files/c2.html">
 The basic engine is in. Player and enemy movement is all working. 
Combat runs smoothly, if a little uneven at the moment. Level generation
 is working better than I'd hoped. Dungeons are created and populated 
with monsters features and items. I wanted level gen. to look like it 
could have been done by a human level designer, and for the most part 
things look so. There are only the occasional 'why is it like that?!' 
moment, but plenty of 'that looks fitting' moments. Most of the 
interface elements are in, the only missing ones are the sound related 
stuff.<br><br><img src="300&amp;log=1801_files/c3.html"> My aim is to 
have masses of content, so much in fact that most will never see all of 
it. I want players to mention something cool they saw in the game to 
other players and have the other players response be 'I've never seen 
one of those whenever I've played'. This may be too much of an 
undertaking so it's more of a 'shoot for the moon' goal. The content 
currently stands at 125 dungeon features, 85 monsters, and 46 items in 
the first dungeon theme, although that should increase dramatical before
 I'm finished. And that brings me to another aspect of the game, dungeon
 themes. Each dungeon will have a coherent theme which should mean that 
you will not get out of place monsters, items or features on any play 
through. I'm not sure how many dungeon themes I'm going for but I 
already have a lot of ideas so again this will be as many as I can.<br><br><b>Still to do</b><br><img src="300&amp;log=1801_files/c4.html">
 There is loads still to do, hence the 20% icon at the top. The game is 
still missing the whole front end, currently it goes straight into the 
game. There is no sound at all, I'll probably do that last, and look to 
getting someone in to do the music. There is very little in the way of 
effects in there, so there's still lots more visual punch is to come.<br><br><b>Additional Info</b><br>Website <a href="http://www.hackslashloot.com/" target="_blank">HackSlashLoot.com</a><br>Twitter <b>@</b><a href="http://www.twitter.com/OddballDave" target="_blank"><b>OddballDave</b></a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/search?q=%23hackslashloot" target="_blank">#hackslashloot</a><br>DevLog: <a href="http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=17415.0" target="_blank">TIGSource</a> <br><br> DaveW<br><br><img src="300&amp;log=1801_files/smallblob.gif"><b>PhysLite[</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/phys.html" target="_blank">Info</a><b>]<img src="300&amp;log=1801_files/smallblob.gif">ODD.mod[</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/mods/odd2dmodule.zip" target="_blank">Odd2D.mod</a><b>][</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/temp/aspectmodule.zip" target="_blank">Aspect.mod</a><b>][</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/temp/asciifontmodule.zip" target="_blank">AsciiFont.mod</a><b>]</b><br>"When you're the last man standing and still packing nukes you don't need experience points."<i> - Brian Van Hoose</i> </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
