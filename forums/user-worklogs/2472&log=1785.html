 Is the stupid name for my Spline Editor, which is underway.  It'll also
 become my font editor as the two programs share most aspects.<br><br>In
 fact I'll just make my spline editor allow you to do all of the things 
required to make the font textures that my text system requires.<br><br>It's
 pretty slow going, but I've decided the general layout.  I need to edit
 basic splines, transformed splines, multi-splines and visible slpines. 
 The visible splines are defined by multi-splines, which are comprised 
of transformed splines which expand on simple splines.  What a palaver.<br><br>Or
 so it seemed when I started thinking about it, but now I'm much more 
comfortable.  Doing it this way allows me to base lots of things on a 
handful of pre-defined splines without having to re-calculate the 
coefficients.<br><br>For example a single smooth spline running from 
zero to one can be transformed to fit any transition between two 
numbers.  And it can be added or multiplied into a multi-spline to alter
 that splines ultimate output.<br><br>It all may sound daft.  It sounds a
 bit daft as I type it, but I'm pretty confident it'll be fine.  And 
easily fast enough to have splines all over the damn place.  The more I 
play with them the more I see ways of using them to make my game look 
and feel "modern", if you get my meaning.<br><br>Anyway, still no shots.

 The reason I started on all the spline stuff was the fact that I wanted
 to perk up the menu screens.  Which, incidentally I did finish up to 
the point proposed in the "Ploughing through menus" post.<br><br>And the
 buttons do fly around nicely, but I wanted them to arrange themselves 
in pleasant curves.  Hence all the spline rendering stuff.<br><br>Which 
has been nice to do.  Though it's not quite finished yet.  Sometimes the
 outcome of a piece of code is astonishingly close to the initial 
concept.  Is so sweet when everything works pretty much as intended.<br><br>So now I have lovely flexible Splines, which I've been playing with wondering why I've never done this before.<br><br>One day I will post some examples of all this stuff.

 Again, as the title suggests.  Put together a spline type, partly from 
code archive code (by xMicky).  Now spline rendering which should look 
lovely if I do it right.  Am hoping to be able to have scrolling text 
stretched between two spline rails.  If all goes according to plan...<br><br>At
 very least have nice spline drawing options.  Lots of uses in special 
effects, but also for use in font rendering program.  Which will 
probably be started once spline rendering is done.<br><br>Apart from rendering, I forsee lots of uses for splines in creating natural movements and scaling for my non-Box2D objects.<br><br>Mainly I just want to see if I'll be able to render realistic looking sparks with my splines.

 As the title suggests.  This bit doesn't require learning more about 
BMax, OpenGL or Box2D.  It's just going through the logic.  What needs 
to happen, when and how.  The code hasn't been runnable for a couple of 
days.<br><br>I'm just going to go through most of the whole menu system:
  The opening screen, the player creation screen, the player selection 
screen and the game selection and score screen.  I'll do all of this

about 30 or 40 runs as the compiler informs me of my spelling and syntax
 errors, then another few days spent arranging buttons and everything 
just right.  I find doing it this way fun.<br><br>Also, a comment about a
 shot in the Gallery: AR Art by jhocking.  I'm a bit unsure, but does 
iminib3d mean I'll be able to use openGL or something simmilar with

 Using my own vector class now and everything seems neat again.  No 
leaks for now, but I suspect it was the process of going through the 
code to convert that solved the problem rather than my vector.  I prefer
 my class though, so it feels it was worth the change.<br><br>Suspect that looking for leaks will require ceaseless vigilance.  Not my idea of fun, but I'm happy for now.<br><br>Relaxed enough about it to finally get onto menu screen arrangements.<br><br>Edit - RE Delete()<br><br>It

outline of how OpenGL and Box2D worked and knew how I wanted to use 
them, but was slogging away on code that wouldn't run for weeks.  In 
fact it doesn't run now.  Anyway, it has stunted me in terms of the 
other things BMax does.  Been pretty naive about OpenGL I now realise,

  So I'm a bit more confident that the garbage collection is fine 
concerning Box2d.  Is a leak somewhere in my own code.  One day this 
will fail to suprise me.  Will pursue over the weekend. <br><br> ANGUS </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Menus and Memory Leaks</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2010-11-17)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> So I've defined my buttons and pointers and they all are working nicely, taking me to and from games just as planned.<br><br>But
 something's leaking somewhere.  Flicking from menu to game to menu to 
game seems to be eating the occasional Ks.  It's not completely 
predictable.<br><br>Nulling fields of items that refer to Box2D objects 
seems to have minimised the problem, bafflingly.  I know I have to make 
the b2world destroy bodies but should I really then have to nullify 
fields that I hold pointing to their shapes?  Even when the instance 
that holds that field is about to be nullified itself?<br><br>I also 
wonder if I should be destroying Box2d vectors... there's a delete 
method there, though I can't call it from Blitz.  If I re-name the 
method, re-build the module, then be sure to call it for all my b2vecs, 
will that work?<br><br>Come to think of it, those vectors could be 
stacking up behind the scenes and the garbage collection wouldn't show 
it anyway... would it?<br><br>Above all, should I plunge into trying to 
find the answers to my numerous questions, or should I just start 
posting them to the forums?<br><br>Anyway, I have some avenues to 
explore and it's only a tiny leak.  I can work on some other things 
while I ponder it.  I'm going to think about getting most of the title

 My larger project ground to a halt for a while.  It's still there in 
the back of my mind but loading sets of editor-defined custom types was 
doing my head in.  The news about bmx2 made me decide to dust off an 
old, much simpler, game idea which might be suitable for all sorts of 
devices.<br><br>Making this game also forces me to  come to terms with 
OpenGL and Box2d much more quickly, both of which are an inevitability 
for my larger project.  This has been a great learning experience with 
which to return to my platform game shortly.<br><br>For the time being progress on this game has been relatively quick and easy.<br><br>The
 game involves controlling a spinning bat near the bottom of a tall 
"court" which contains a few balls.  Other items may be in the court as 
well depending on the game type.<br><br>The vanilla game simply requires
 you to stop the balls touching the bottom of the court.  Each time you 
strike a ball, your score multiplier increases and you get a score based
 on that multiplier.  Sounds wierd, but with the onscreen display I 
think it becomes quite natural quickly.<br><br>I made version of the 
game before which though I loved it, I admit that the control system was
 pretty unnatural to say the least.  I have amended this and think it's 
much better now.  We'll see :)<br><br>So far I've written the underlying
 item control stuff for bats, balls, the court and backdrops, sprites 
and text in openGL and my collision listeners are there making sensible 
lists of what's hitting what.  I'll post a screenshot when I find some 
webspace to put it in.<br><br>The text display was the last thing I 
made, and the last required before I build the overall structure:  
title, option, player creation and level selection screens.  Once this 
bit (which is a bit I enjoy) is done, I'll make a few game styles to try
 it out.<br><br>Playing with the bat and balls in the court seems pretty
 good to me.  Keeping them off the ground is fun, but making them crack 
against eachother in mid-air feels very satisfying.  As I say, we'll 
see.<br><br>Am loving OpenGL despite some initial head-aches.  And am ADORING box2D.  My objects just look so sweet.<br><br>Anyway... next up: Titles and game-modes. <br><br> ANGUS </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
