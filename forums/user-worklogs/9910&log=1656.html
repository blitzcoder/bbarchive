 the game was running slowly so I decided to implement the OpenGL 
driver.  Even though the performance was more than enough, there is an 
annoying problem where the program crashes after I exit it.<br><br>I was then directed to a DX9 lib, but this did not function properly.<br><br>My
 next route was to devise a way to get the DirectDraw driver to run fast
 enough.  My solution was fullscreen mode with scaling for widescreen 
monitors (see last post).  This worked fine until I wrote a function 
that needed transparency using MaskImage, which did not work correctly 
in the DirectDraw driver.  It works fine in the integrated driver and 
OGL, but, as we established, that doesn't work.  Now, I could change my 
button drawing routine to work with solid squares instead of nicely 
bordered, resizable boxes, but I don't feel like I should have to settle
 for less to fit B+'s limitations, especially when a routine like this 
works in the other two available drivers.<br><br>I then took some advice and tried to make the game run in a B+ canvas.  Still crashes on close, and has horrible performance.<br><br>I
 am so fed up with this.   I have spent a lot of time and energy on this
 game and was making some great progress.  At least I can say canceling 
it was not on my accord.<br><br>I will spend a little bit looking for 
graphics bottlenecks in hopes I can make it run on the integrated card. 
 If I don't find anything, and BRL doesn't step in to fix these bugs, 
I'll will be saying goodbye to Crystal Conquest, as well as BlitzBasic 
as a whole. <br><br> -Sauer </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Widescreen Support</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2010-10-04)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">

find an easy to implement way to add better support, I'll do so, but for

 I've switched onto my other project lately, so not much progress here. 
 This is healthy though, and seeing as I've only invested my time in two
 projects for the past year and a half means I must be doing something 
right.<br><br>But today I was thinking about Crystal Conquest a little, 
and came to the realization that it is nearly done.  When I decide to

 a bit silly, being this far into it and wondering this, but I guess I 
never even really thought about it.  I had a vision of what I wanted the
 game to be, made it, and here we are.  Personally, I think its a bit 
suspenseful and certainly challenging, but its definitely difficult to 
judge your own creations.<br><br>I guess we'll find out.  If its not 
fun, its not fun; there was no investment lost or dream shattered.  But

 I finished the shop where you can buy items to help you solve the 
puzzles.  There are currently 6 items, as I decided that having an item 
to convert to every color tile would be redundant and offer little to 
the solving of the puzzle.<br><br>I added the credits aspect to the 
game, and now I just have to do the end of level resolution screen next 
to calculate how many credits the player gets from solving the puzzle.  <br><br>I
 did run into a problem with one of the items, the Neutralizer, which 
converts the block value to 0.  The problem is, because I'm using 
arrays, 0 is registered as no-pick.  The solutions are simple; I can 
think of another item or go into the architecture of the picks and 
switch the "no pick" number to -10 or something.  I haven't quite 
decided yet, but what I do know is that it would be really nice to have 
dynamic arrays like in python, of a C++ vector.  I could have used a 
linked list I guess...<br><br>Oh well, I'm going outside now. <br><br> -Sauer </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Stages and Mapscreen</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2010-03-29)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">

 Today was one of those times.  I had been looking at optimization 
techniques, frustrated with my fog level slowing to a crawl because of 
the tile rendering.  I had narrowed it down this far, but couldn't find a
 viable solution.<br><br>Obviously I had my memory intensive method, but
 I wanted to render the tiles like I was.  So I started looking into the
 render code, which fortunately is only in 2-3 places (once for the main
 and the other two in "special case" functions)<br><br>What I saw 
horrified me.  My code was littered with "*32" arithmetic commands!  
What the heck was I thinking? In my other game, I bit shifted like a 
madman to avoid optimization problems, but in this project (most of 
which was written around the same time) I did nothing of the sort.  Why 
this is I cannot say, but I went through and fixed all the 
multiplication in the rendering as well as throughout the code where I 
deemed it unnecessary or could go with a power of 2 and bit shift.<br><br>Still
 a problem with a rendering.  Puzzling at first, but then I looked a bit
 closer;  I know Blitz is supposed to have a fast 2D graphics, and 9 
tiles on a screen (even including lookup) should not cause a problem.  
Then I looked at my previous statement: no, 9 SPRITES draw quickly.<br><br>Is
 my tile rendering spritebased?  Yeah.  Sort of.  Half way.  The colored
 tiles are sprites, but the numbers are written on the fly using the 
text command.<br><br>Facepalm.<br><br>So I quickly generated a list of 
prerendered tiles, threw them in, and imagine that.  Hums at a cheery 60
 FPS, particle system and all, no problem.<br><br>I can't believe I 
didn't spot it before, but I'm proud of myself for figuring it out using
 a systematic approach.  After a day of "what was I thinking when I did 
this" and many facepalms, the level looks beautiful and runs great. <br><br>Can't feel too bad about that. <br><br> -Sauer </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Problems solved... somewhat</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2010-03-12)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Thought I would go ahead and make a new entry; doesn't hurt anything.<br><br>I
 fixed the bottleneck.  Not entirely sure why THAT was causing the 
slowdown, especially since it always happened after a minute or two of 
runtime, but it doesn't matter.<br><br>What I did was change the item 
selection from clicking on buttons to simply pressing down the mouse 
wheel.  I figure its easier on the users, to make faster picks and using
 items quicker.  Also, its less ugly clutter at the bottom of the 
screen, and less stuff a artist would have to do.<br><br>I also went 
through and looked for for loops that could be broken out of, and found a
 few.  If I just keep it in my head to be vigilant for optimizations by 
the time I'm complete I should have a lot of them worked out.  In all 
reality, the code is not massive by any standard (just over 1000 lines) 
so it shouldn't be too difficult.<br><br>There's still a slowdown on the
 fog level, and I think this is because of how I have to access the 
array, analyze the contents, and draw the contents nine times per frame 
(one for every tile).  There has to be a better way.<br><br>One idea I 
had was to make a 320x320 sprite that lays on top of the grid, and the 
different frames are the different "windows" that you can see through 
depending on where the mouse is on the grid.  This would probably be 
pretty fast, but take a ton of memory.  I like to try to rationalize and
 say that the game currently takes little memory and computers are so 
powerful, but I still can't bring myself to cope with a 100 frame, 
320x320 sprite.  Its insanity.<br><br>So I must be creative.  These are 
the kinds of things I like to think about before I go to bed though.  I 
do my best thinking in the shower, so maybe tomorrow morning I'll come 
up with something brilliant.<br><br>The good news is that the last level
 I have to do (the closing in level) will be really easy and not 
computationally expensive, and after that I can move on.   I'm getting 
more and more inspired to finish the game as I get closer and closer.<br><br>I'm
 a little curious as to what the reception will be.  I must be sure to 
go above and beyond so I don't get railed when I decide to release the 
alpha.<br><br>EDIT:<br>Thought I would go ahead and post an updated in 
game shot, without the ugly buttons or tiles.  This is of planet 2, 
Arok, and those bluish purple things are the null blocks.<br><img src="9910&amp;log=1656_files/l_9d903150c7134bf19818063487970a28.png"> <br><br> -Sauer </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Some progress</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2010-03-11)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 I was working on the fog level, but am currently running into a huge 
FPS loss.  Trying to think of creative ways to overcome this.  The 
closing in level will be easy so I'm going to take a lot of time to get 
this level working properly without cutting corners.<br><br>EDIT:<br><br>Alright
 well I found out that the FPS decrease has nothing to do with the fog 
level code; its actually some bottleneck in the code.  After letting the
 game run for a minute or two it slows to about 29 FPS, which is about 
half of what it is supposed to run at.<br><br>First I checked to see if 
it was in the picking mechanism and redrawing the screen (which is very 
computationally expensive in relation to the rest of the game).  I got 
two major optimizations in, one that breaks a for loop when deemed 
unnecessary and the other a function that only redraws the tiles that 
changed, not the entire grid.<br><br>Still slows to a crawl.<br><br>Now I'm going through and commenting out just about every function to isolate the problem.  More to come.<br><br>EDIT 2:<br>After
 commenting out  a good portion of my code, I found the problem to be in
 the item selection.  I don't know why it has the effect of slowing it 
down after running for a few minutes, but now it doesn't slow down 
anymore.<br><br>Now I have to implement a new item selection function.  I
 don't mind too much because I never liked how the old one looked, and 
this gives me an excuse to fix it.  <br><br>I expect small slow downs 
throughout the game, but as long as it stays over 45 FPS it will be 
fine.  The code is probably getting to a point where it could use some 
tidying, and I'll get to that ASAP. <br><br> -Sauer </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Particle systems, level stuff</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2010-02-11)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Today I redid my little particle system that is used every time a 
combination of 11 is found.  I had the traditional "throwing particles 
around" style emitter but to make it look good, it was bogging down my 
frame rate.  Also, I'm no expert on particles anyway so it didn't look 
that great.<br><br>I replaced it with a simple sprite system that shows 
an explosion.  This is simple yet effective, and any artist would be 
able to go in and make a better suited sprite.<br><br>I also added the 
"dummy" blocks for level 2, and the 'dead' world of level 5.  This 
leaves shape shifting, fog, and closing in levels.  For the closing in 
levels I'll probably convert them into dummy blocks like in level 2.<br><br>Today
 I took the time to get some images uploaded.  I went through and found 
all the images I got from google and found all of their sources.  Keep

 I went ahead and made credits, instructions and story pages for the 
main menu.  Then, I took the map screen and added smooth transitioning 
from level to level.  I also added a little space station that will 
serve as the shop.<br><br>Next up is to change the data structures to 
match the 6 planet, three stage per planet style.  Logically, after that
 would be the displaying this information on the map screen, and then 
reflecting it to the main loop.<br><br>Also, as far as game design goes,
 I'm considering making a "challenge" mode which is just a jumble of 
strange puzzle combinations.  I think this would be good, as the 
scenario portion of the game will be quite small.<br><br>Again, I'm

stated at the beginning of this project that I wanted them to be done by
 an outside source, so I'm going to treat them as placeholders and just

menu with some comments depicting a 'road map' of the pages I need.<br><br>I'm
 going to continue cleaning up the code and getting rid of some 
redundancies.  Also, I need to change the level data structure, as I 
want to implement three stages per planet, for a total of 18 stages.  
The difference in the stages will be the goal number, goal score, and 
goal time to create different levels of difficulty.<br><br>Each planet will have to have a certain special feature to the puzzle.  Here are them listed briefly:<br><br>1. No special feature, just the first level so nothing fancy (earth like planet)<br>2. A 'block' that has no value and cannot be elimated (ice planet)<br>3. A shape shifting level where some values change every now and then (red, rocky, mars like planet)<br>4. "Fog" feature where you have a limited sight around the mouse (jupiter like planet)<br>5.  No color bonuses (dead, gray planet)<br>6.  Level that slowly closes in on itself (lava planet)<br><br>There.  This post has turned into a bit of a design document.  Lets keep going shall we?<br><br>Save/Load
 will just save progress in the game, what levels have been beaten, what
 items you have, time logged, etc.  I may even do a high score thing for
 fastest solutions<br><br>Story will just be a couple of static picture story boards, which I'll find some placeholders for.  Nothing big there.<br><br>The
 shop will have numerous items.  You buy them with gold you get from 
beating older levels at fast times; the harder the level the more gold. 
 They are:<br>  -Block Bomb: creates a block of ones of 1 color<br>  -Randomizer: makes a new grid<br>  -Machine Coolant : gives you an extra 5 seconds<br>  -Jackhammer: breaks the ice blocks in level 2<br>  -Flare: breaks the fog in level 4<br>  -ColorConvert(Red): converts a block to red, one for each color<br>  -Zero Block: converts the block value to 0<br>  -others as I think, but thats a good base.<br><br>Blarg I'm tired, can't wait to work on this a little more tomorrow. <br><br> -Sauer </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Video</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-07-30)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">

with a couple of items to make the game more interesting but not 
overbearing.<br><br>First there are six levels, each with three sub 
levels.  The difference in the sub levels is the number to get increases
 per level, and the time or goal may be adjusted.  This makes a

 each planet has a special challenge based on the nature of that planet.

better job and had better software.<br><br>If he does alright on this job I may ask him to do other backgrounds or screens. <br><br> -Sauer </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>And another contradiction...</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-02-01)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 So now I changed my mind about changing the theme.  I really hate the 
map screen and the theme I changed it too.  I can't really describe what
 makes it different but I absolutely can't stand it.<br><br>Also, when 
looking at my project goals from the first post, the goal is to make 
something of the highest quality of the casual games industry, with no 
specification on the sales of the game.  I think that changing to 
another theme was in attempt to ensure better sales, but that's not what
 this project is all about is it?<br><br>Furthermore, as life gets more 
expensive the idea of hiring an artist becomes less and less a 
possibility.  Well, let me rephrase that... the idea of hiring a <i>really good</i>
 artist.  There are always people that will work for cheap or royalties,
 but just don't produce the best work.  I'll probably have to take that 
route, so I can have at least an improvement on graphics, but not 
necessarily sell worthy graphics.  Again, because sales are not a 
priority, mostly just proof that a quality product is obtainable.<br><br>I'm
 having fun finding pictures of planets, stars, nebulas, and comets and 
implementing them into my game... and I'm always saying how fun is the 
important part.<br><br>So space theme it stays! <br><br> -Sauer </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Change of Theme</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-01-29)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 After reading some articles online, as well as some input from the 
members of this forum, I've decided to change the theme of Crystal 
Conquest from space to 'explorer' or 'adventure' theme.  It seems that 
the space theme does not sit well with the portals.<br><br>I just 
started working on the map screen, which is the only thing that is 
really affected.  Since the game was going to take place on each planet,
 I can just say its on different parts of the world.  It fits in to.<br><br>I plan on changing the story to something like this:<br><br>The
 world's power reactors are on the fritz!  Powered by the power 
crystals, the reactors need to be unjammed so energy can be restored to 
the planet.  Travel the world to unjam each of the (x) elemental 
crystals and save humanity!<br><br>Why something like this would sit better with the casual crowd is beyond me, but that's what I'm hearing.<br><br>I'm
 currently working on this game and another application, so I get a good
 mix and don't get burnt out.  When I get frustrated with a particular 
aspect not working, I just switch gears and feel better.<br><br>I'm off to go work on my new map screen, which will look like some sort of global map.  Maybe I'll use Earth? <br><br> -Sauer </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Well nevermind then!</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-01-15)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Just after posting that I wouldn't have enough time to work on this 
project, I had one of my more productive days of late.  I basically 
finished items, the only thing left to do is create more of them.  The 
mechanics for how items are selected and used has been completed.<br><br>I
 noticed after playing the game a few times that you are allowed to 
select diagonally.  At first I thought I should hurry up and fix it but 
after a couple plays it really opens up more opportunities for matches 
and forces the user to plan moves by observing all of the possibilities.
  I like it!<br><br>Another 'mistake' that worked is that I realized you
 are able to hold down the mouse button and drag across to pick numbers.
  This makes play more fast paced and makes larger selections easier.<br><br>Everything
 is going swimmingly except I noticed my game runs pretty slow... a 
whopping 25 FPS.  I'm not sure if this is acceptable (the game plays 
fine for the most part) but I definitely need to do some streamlining to
 get that up a bit.  I ditched my junky particle system and that helped a
 bit but something else is slowing it down...<br><br>So far the code clocks in at 635 lines, and has been in production for 22 days.  I'm pretty happy so far with my productivity.<br><br>So next item (along with streamlining) is creating the map screen. <br><br> -Sauer </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>And back a few steps...</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-01-14)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Been really busy with school, so work on this project has been designated to weekends.<br><br>Obviously less productivity is expected. <br><br> -Sauer </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Step by Step</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-01-09)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Yes step by step is definitely the way I am taking this project, 
inching along piece by piece and trying to make everything as flexible 
as possible for the artist and myself.  As I have never worked with an 
artist before I don't know what to expect, but am trying my best to make
 it as easy as possible for him/her.<br><br>Well I finished designing 
the HUD (or at least a basic version of it) as well as began working on 
the item mechanism.  I got four basic items and their functions all 
worked out, but have done little more than tested how they will display 
on the screen.  <br><br>In the following days I will continue working on
 the items.  I have pretty much laid out a general outline of what needs
 to be done.  This is strictly gameplay wise, having nothing to do with 
final processing (resolutions, compatibility, testing etc.)<br><br>1. Items<br>2. Map Screen<br>    2.5 Mini Games, Shop, Story Development<br>3. Title Screen<br>4. Effects and loose ends<br><br>Granted
 this is pretty general but I believe that having a plan, no matter how 
broad, will be useful.  Also, to specifically write down everything that
 needs to be done would be difficult and wasteful, as casual game 
production is extremely fine tuned and sometimes ideas spawn from simple
 testing.<br><br>Well enough of my blabbering, here's a screenshot.  
Keep in mind that my art is awful and will all be replaced.  This can 
however, give a general idea of what the game will look like.  Comments 
and feedback are appreciated (as if anyone was reading this thing 
anyway) and my e-mail is in my profile.<br><br>EDIT: IMAGE REMOVED. <br><br> -Sauer </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Dilemma</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-01-07)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Today I started designing my HUD for my game, and my idea was a 
"machine" that wraps the bottom and right side of the grid.  The bottom 
would be for displaying picked items, and the right side would have two 
bars, one displaying time limit and the other displaying current score. 
 <br><br>Because the game revolves around 'powering crystals' the bars should lead to a crystal, and when full, the level is complete.  <br><br>The
 problem is that I don't know how to create proper place holders and 
implement the bars, which should be flexible because the artist will 
draw both the machine and the bars.  I guess in that sense it doesn't 
really matter what I draw... I'm just going to have to re-program it 
anyway.<br><br>I also need to begin designing the map screen as well as an improved title screen and menu. <br><br> -Sauer </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Fonts and Title</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-01-03)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 I didn't have a lot of time to work on the game today, but I did find 
some time after work to find a nice freeware font on the internet and 
find a title screen background.<br><br>The font is sci-fi but easy to 
read.  I may use it in the final product if everything blends well, but 
everything graphically is still officially temporary.  The background 
for the title screen is actually the command deck of Starship Enterprise
 from StarTrek, so that is definitely temporary, but I do want the 
command deck of a ship as the title screen, and so far I like the 
atmosphere it gives.<br><br>As far as gameplay goes I noticed that as 
the game progresses it gets extremely difficult to make matches, and the
 reason was that the grid never reset per level, meaning the grid was 
parched of potential matches.  I added a function to reset the grid 
values so this was taken care of. <br><br> -Sauer </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Molding the Prototype</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-01-01)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 I had written a prototype of the game using simple text based GUI and 
display to see if the design was up to speed.  After taking some advice 
from the forums, I believe the game now has a sufficient design plan to 
begin creating a version with placeholder graphics.  <br><br>Today I 
spent some time commenting and reorganizing my code.  I feel that I work
 more efficiently when I mark off sections of my code and label all 
functions, so I took the time to do that.  I also when online to find 
some landscape images of each of the eight planets, for backgrounds.  <br><br>My
 goal is to find/create placeholder graphics that are as similar as 
possible to what I want the final product to look like, that way it'll 
be easier on the artist when hired.<br><br>So far it appears that the main mechanics of the game are running smoothly, which is a good sign. <br><br> -Sauer </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>The Beginning</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-01-01)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Description:  A casual game where you match adjacent tiles to add to 
eleven.  If the tiles are of the same color, then a bonus is added to 
the score.  Each level has a score goal to reach in a set amount of 
time; both vary from level to level.  The game also includes items to 
use during play which can alter the time limit, goal, and numbers on the
 board.  Items can be 'purchased' with credits earned during play, or 
won by completing certain achievements.<br><br>Goals for Project:  
Create a product worthy of portals or self publication.  Product should 
meet all of the highest quality standards of the casual game industry.  
Whether the game sells well is not a priority, but simply the practice 
and pride of creating a noteworthy game.<br><br>Notes:  Game should be 
fairly short, yet provide significant challenge toward the end of the 
game.  Graphics should be crisp and professional, done by an outside 
source.  Story is interesting, but not incredibly deep.<br><br>Story:  
Many light-years away lies a solar system of eight planets that orbit a 
single sun.  As the sun grew older, it became apparent that its rate of 
growth must be controlled to avoid supernova.  To do this, StarFleet 
Command harvested the energy of the power crystals found on every planet
 with specially made reactors.  With all eight reactors working at full 
capacity, the sun could be controlled and it's longevity increased.<br><br>But
 trouble strikes when the reactors are jammed by a mysterious figure, 
holding the planets hostage to their own sun.  It is up to you, a 
StarFleet cadet, to visit each of the eight planets to restore the 
crystal reactors and save the solar system. <br><br> -Sauer </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
