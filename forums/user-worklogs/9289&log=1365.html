 Today, I've included a heightmap painting program, that allows for 
drawing heightmaps. As I'm writing this, I realise that maybe I could 
include a colormap to it as well.<br>The last few days I was busy making
 some sort of MS Assistant. A figure called 'Ricardo' shows up. You can

 to include all functions, because else I needed to change the helpfiles

 found a lot of bugs. In fact, because of these classes I have now a

 The new-old 'compiler' works really nice. It is very structurized, and 
easy to implement more commands. The program was written when I just 
started with the project, so I was still fresh.<br>There are still a few
 commands I'd like to add, for instance the 'Text' command. However, all
 commands and parameters are converted into numbers, so I need to find a
 way to pass strings to there. It is only the 'Text' command that 
handles strings, so it is not a big issue.<br>I've rewritten the GUI 
functions. The new interface makes the program more stable. Everything 
has a more solid/robust feel over it. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>wb1.03b</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-12-15)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> This is the program running:<br><img src="9289&amp;log=1365_files/screen1.PNG"><br>You can see one of the cubes exploding.

 I worked on the basic stuff again. At first, it could only run the 
entity-based commands, for clicking/showing/hiding objects, but now it 
can also load the mathematical commands, such as sin and cos.<br>I am 
working on the game property editors, to choose between plane and 
terrain, select textures/maps for the terrains and enable/disable fog 
and ambientlight. I've made a chasecam routine, and I will make the user
 select what type of control and cameramode should be used.<br><img src="9289&amp;log=1365_files/props.PNG"><br>As a test, I wrote this forest scene, in Blitz3D, not the gamebuilder:<br><img src="9289&amp;log=1365_files/forest.PNG"><br>All
 the trees are a single mesh. The terrain is 'infinitive', well not 
really, after crossing a certain boundry, the player is warped to the 
other side. Sort of like PacMan did in 2D. The trees are randomly 
placed, merged into a single mesh, and then this complete mesh is 
CopyEntitied 8 times in all different directions. That way the trees 
stay in the same spot when you are warped.<br>The water is at terrain 
height 0. With a 3rd texture I masked the terrain where the water should
 be. The water itself is a mirror and a textured plane with alpha 
enabled. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>w1.01</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-11-26)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> <img src="9289&amp;log=1365_files/bird.PNG"><br>Today

 am finally confident in the 'compound' saving routines. They *seem* to 
be working allright. I've made a few versions of the interface, in 
different colours. One for each part I am working on:<br>(1) extrude .. as good as finished, needs bugtesting still<br>(2) lathe .. still needs texture coordinates<br>(3) compound .. as good as finished, needs testing too<br>(4) world editor .. is going allright, only thing is it is getting too slow maybe. Say, 50% done.<br>(5) basic .. 'compiles' to a blitz3d program, but not really readable code, more like this:<br>X# = 1<br>X# = X# * 2<br>X# = X# + 1<br>X# = SQR(X#)<br>p1$ = X#<br>X# = 2<br>p2$ = X#<br>X# = 0<br>p3$ = X#<br>BAS_TURN p1$, p2$, p3$<br>So, not yet finished.

 the total program should be able to save games somehow. But it would 
require saving all the game data into a single folder, so that one I 
find tricky.<br><br>And 'as good as being finished' means, everything 
important works and I don't feel any structural redesigning needs to be 
done. However, the 'New' and 'Undo' buttons don't work and the program 
can't save any projects, only export models. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>1.05</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-11-12)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> <img src="9289&amp;log=1365_files/preview.png"><br>I
 discovered the saving routine couldn't save angle differences over 179 
degrees. Somehow it allways turned via the shortest side. If you wanted 
to rotate an object 360 degrees in one frame, after saving it, it didn't
 move.<br>I calculate the biggest difference in angles between two 
frames and then divide this number by 90. The result is the factor I'm 
extending the animation with.<br>So a rotation of 360 degrees will 
generate 4 times more frames than originally designed. That way all 
differences are kept within the range 0..90 (I hope).<br>Oh and I 
replaced the interface with a smooth version. I replaced the pixelated 
circles with common circles.

 I got the saving routine in 'compound' worked out. Child meshes were

 the child, but it's scaling doesn't.<br>So .. 4.49 AM ..

 Now I am working on the programming part. The block structure is based 
on Lego MindStorms, however I still like to call this language Basic.<br>I've designed new buttons, based on a mario tile.

 language has only simple instructions: move/turn/position very much the
 same as Blitz. It can only hold 26 variables A-Z, that are floats.<br>A program is executed every frame. The engine automatically adjust the game's speed to the PC speed.<br>The
 level will be a collapsed object, the entities are Animated characters,
 that are controlled by either a path or the code. The camera control 
keys are predefined in a sub-menu. <br><br>Writing the graphical programming structure was strange. An If..Endif block has 2 parts, which can't be reversed.<br>If
 you have multiple IF's, you shouldn't be able to place the 2nd Endif 
before the first one, all the 'wires' get entangled. I've solved this by
 disabling the ability to drag the Endif block and in case the If block 
ends up in a different indention level, the Endif block moves along.<br><br>Formulas can be entered too, in a Calculator-like interface. <br>Ie.:<br>Calculate-&gt;Select Variable "X"-&gt;Press "+" "1" <br>= <br>X=X+1<br><br>or<br>Calculate-&gt;Select Variable "X"-&gt;Press "1"<br>=<br>X=1<br><br>Well, will keep you updated.

 The gamebuilder is a lot more work than I expected. However, I'm not 
giving up yet. I want it to be done in January, when I start giving 
classes.<br>The idea is to create a program that allows you to create 3d
 games. However I knew almost nothing about writing 3d games, so I've 
learnt a lot on this project.<br>For a longer description, read this post:<br><a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=58501" target="_blank">http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=58501</a><br>The first tool I wanted to show is compound:<br><img src="9289&amp;log=1365_files/comp.JPG"><br><br>1)
 It can't load/append/save projects yet, but it saves animations when 
you press "Q". After saving, the editing becomes impossible, so consider
 it a very beta version.<br>2) Because objects can be parented to other 
objects, and saving animation only saves keypoints, I needed to 
interpolate the animation when saving. Every frame gets saved in 100 
steps. I know this is really overdoing it, but it was the only way I 
could get this to work. Later on, I will replace it with a more 
'intelligent' version, that determines what frames should be saved.<br>3)
 The interface .. at first I was happy with the blue bubblegum 
interface, but some people didn't like it. So I am trying to develop a 
nicer-looking interface that can replace this one. Since the interface 
is a separate module that returns strings, it is very easy to replace it
 with something else.<br><br>Still, I would like somebody to help me. 
(designing the interface/creating objects/giving 
suggestions/betatesting/help programming) In fact, any help/feedback is 
welcome, so if you have some old UV unwrapping code lying around for 
instance :Please let me know. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
