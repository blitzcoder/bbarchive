 off the air Bombers can attack multiple turns and at from any angle 
(ball turret gunners) and they are strong and can attack land targets. 
fighters on the other hand are weak but are harder to hit and they can 
perform evasive manuvers to get behind enemies and then to fill the 
enemy aircraft with lead (evasive combo's)distance and angles play a 
role here as distance increases the accuracy suffers and all weapons 
have range because distance plays a role so a sniper with a springfield 
'03 can nail a Nazi manning a machine gun from 50 feet while a machine 
gunner with a BAR can't even reach that far. <br><br> there are 10 types of people in the world those who understand binary and those who don't </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>The basics</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2007-01-12)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> before I continue I will explain the gameplay mechanics<br><br>It is an RPG at heart with few puzzle elements (stuff like using pipes to overload a facility with a toxic gas)<br><br>Ypu
