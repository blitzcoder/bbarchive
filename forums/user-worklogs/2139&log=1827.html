 Relations developed between United (Con)Federation of Planets and the 
Argalian? Imperium to better counter increasing incursion outside the 
(Con)federations borders at which resources ferried by free traders for 
the (Con)Federations consumption arrives. Regrettably the region is 
become a hotbed of pirate activity as the Imperial Navy number are 
currently fully committed at their own borders with the Ta'gral.<br><br>The
 Argalian fleet has agreed to undertake escort missions involving the 
merchant fleet travelling Imperial spacelanes. A number of fighters and 
bombers have been made available for escort duty. All the ships 
available are of Argalian specification and differ somewhat from 
(Con)federate ships. They are smaller but are considered at least equal 
in terms of operability, firepower and armour. Whilst Argalia posesses 
heavier ships these are already assigned to those purposes essential to 
Argalian security and are unlikely to remain in any region for 
sufficient time to enjoin any local skirmish but are a regular feature 
seen by patrols and escorts thru the region.<br><br>The Imperium has 
also agreed to an exchange program of officers. Partly because they now 
have more ships than crews available due to plagues affecting the inner 
planetary systems. Fortunately these are well outside the main trade 
routes and Confederate officers will not be exposed. <br><br> You have buttered your bread and now you must lie in it </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Procurement of meshes</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2011-08-04)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Possible external source for meshes: <a href="http://solcommand.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">http://solcommand.blogspot.com/</a><br><br>Here
 a variety of sci-fi meshes are available provisionally for download at 
nil cost. The models appear to be unique and well crafted and are of 
sufficient variety to populate, probably, the projects initial 
requirement. Permission is already granted to alter the meshes to user 
requirements. They are each of a single surface and will require some 
work to isolate and manipulate such features as gun turrets, cargo 
containers, bay doors and escape pods etc. Possibly the designer will be
 willing to undertake some or all work on the basis of eventual profit 
from the venture. Most likely any other meshes required may be created 
procedurally such as planets, stars, moons, comets and asteroids. <br><br> You have buttered your bread and now you must lie in it </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Offices</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2011-08-04)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Route to success<br><br>Competancy

 I believe most of the elements needed are already in the code archives.
 I'll be starting work at the end of August (2011) when other matters 
are resolved. This may take some time but I feel by limiting the initial
 scope of the project a saleable commodity will be achieved in a 
reasonable time frame.<br><br>My personal preference is to complete in 
B3D as it is more stable than the foundation stones at Giza. As the 
program is intended to run in a supervised environment forwards 
compatibility is irrelevant. <br><br> You have buttered your bread and now you must lie in it </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
