 Functions are now working. Single parameter only due to my laziness. 
Adding those in tomorrow. But you can now right your own functions with 
parameters and it all works. Since the functions variables and 
parameters are renamed to prevent memory leaking and doubling, theres no
 worry of having global variables with the same name as function 
parameters. Functions will have a neat new function of hierachy scope. 
Universal, Global, and Local are the scopes along with Public and 
Private. They effect the overwriting feature with built-in functions and
 defaults. Speed is still the same. Surprisingly saving each function as
 its own class didn't slow things down. 0ms execution for calling a 
custom function. So I hit the 1.6k lines-of-code mark and 38k 
characters. HURRAY! I'm gonna party once I hit 2k. I expect that to be 
just after class-object creation. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>PsyScr3</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2008-11-05)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> InstrWord<br>ReplaceWord<br><br>Both work.<br><br>I
 added commenting. Why I didn't earlier I don't know. So comments are in
 C style. "//" is the key. I also added block commenting by using 
"comment" and "endcomment". But there was a change to the compiler. And 
that was, I added a PreCompile function that will take up cleaning out 
the source code on memory. It will pick-out the comments and blank lines
 as well as moving the function declerations to a new type class 
PSFunction. The PSFunction class will handle the parameters, returns, 
execution, and actually holding the codeing to be executed with the 
function. I chose to do it this way so that functions could be created 
at the bottom and still be usable in the top parts of the script that 
will be executed first. The interpretation is looking to be too slow for
 active runtime. Unless it's only being called once. But for contant 
loop, no promises. Thats why byte-code compiling is for! If it only 
takes 2ms to break down and compile a script I'm sure it should surfice 
for intital loading. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>PsyScr3</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2008-11-03)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Everyday updates now.<br><br>Select/Case/Default/EndSelect where added to the engine. Now work is being done on Functions.<br><br>So functions are gonna be a project in their own.<br><br>Function parameters are treated as variables and are there-for created variables that have localized names.

 will also support default values, and all data types. The only problem I
 came across was using Instr to find and replace variables names/values.
 So I created 2 new functions from scratch InstrWord and ReplaceWord. 
They search the string for whole words and return/replace the matches. 
Examples:<br><br>ReplaceWord("Hello World","World","Blitz") would replace world with blitz. Nothing to amazing<br>ReplaceWord("Into
 Integers","Int","BANNANA") would replace nothing. Because there are no 
whole words named "Int". The function isn't case-sensitive either. I 
will be replacing the variable replacement algorithms with this new 
function. Which will remove the previous bug of variable.<br><br>The bug mixed up the variable names as in:<br><pre class="code">var weight# = 180.5
var moonWeight# = weight*10
print(moonWeight#)
</pre><br>print would then print "moon180.5" because there is already a 
variable that contains the word "weight". The new function only searches
 characters between symbols as to get the "whole word". Expect those 
functions to be posted here later.<br><br>Example of a working script. This script tests everything and works flawlessly in 3ms.<br><pre class="code">var name$ = ""

 So is ziggy giving me some competition? Lol. Just kidding, maybe he can
 join me. Unfortunatly this isn't really a small-scripting language. 
It's turning into a full fledge engine and language in it's own. 
Considering it can be interpreted, short-code compiled, and byte-code 
compiled with Assembly output and linking with other languages for 
stand-alone executables. Dare I say watch out Lua? I mean luas amazing, 
but doesn't it not have active class/object creation. With hierarchy 
style over-writing? It's like a mini-C+ within BlitzMax. But yeah, 
virtual/interpreted/compiled. Thats the idea here.<br><br>More statistics:<br>Source
 code size is over 1.6K lines, and over 26.7k characters. The source and
 engine is all from scratch, and referenced code-snipts where re-typed 
by hand, by me.<br><br>Helpful Hands:<br>If anybody has a better way to 
calculate string formulas fast and accurate I'm open to it. It needs to 
support all the data types. :( That means int, long, float, double, hex,
 and string. Don't worry about object. :) <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Update - PsychoScript 3</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2008-11-01)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">

 Um. So the work is slow. I know the scripting engine is gonna feature a
 event based system for linking into the game. Allowing hooking and 
unhooking to call-back functions. This will empower the user with the 
ultimate in modifications. I'm a bit weary cause this will allow virus 
and cheat creations on whim. But thats fun and I like it when people 
actually take the time to make the game theirs. The whole virus thing 
really struck my fancy though. Cause I can add that as a feature to the 
game. Sickness to the player. Not the virus you where probably thinking 
of but yeah, that works to. A virus would be a script containing the 
class to an object/item/weapon/etc and have a link from onUse or onEquip
 to the virus's object creation. The viruses object would immediatly 
call an infect method which would add a event hook to whatever it 
wanted. The event system would automaticly call the virus's supplied 
call-back and the damage is done. A cure would be a simple call of 
unhookEvent()<br><br>So right now I'm thinking it will get played out like this...<br><pre class="code">hookEvent(EVENT_ID%,OBJECT_REFERENCED,CALL_BACK_FUNCTION)
</pre><br>...and the same for unhookEvent()<br><br>Ahh this is gonna be 
hard. BUT FUN! Oh btw. This development on the scripting language is all
 gonna be bundled into a library for distrabution. PscychoScript3 (wip)

 Internets down, and no money to pay the bill. So commendeering this 
here laptop I shall update you on my biggest project so far. THE 
BIGGEST. Ever.<br><br>I'm expecting months of coding, partnerships, 
hardware upgrading, software upgrading, the whole shabang. I'm going at 
this project a bit (a lot) differently then anything I've done before.<br><br><b>Controllers</b><br>Not
 input controllers but library controllers. A new technique I came up 
with on the fly and I hope it works well. This technique infuses 
BlitzMax with an OOP writing technique but writing the different 
segments of application control in their own indevidual Type classes. So
 the sound engine is one class, graphics another, input another, 
networking, scripting/configuration, logic/AI, and a new one I call 
CGame. A CGame type controlls the game itself and basicly contains 
everything that makes the coding "original". The reason for me coding 
this way is that in the event I switch to 3D, I just change out one 
source file. No coding to switch around or anything. Cause the Graphics 
controller is coded universally. So the type class "CGraphics" will have
 the same name and functions. So calling gfx.Render will be the same for
 Max2D, OpenGL, DirectX3D, etc. etc. Other hierarchy examples include 
update input, networking, actual game logic, changing scripting, you get
 the idea. I anticipate it might be SLIGHTLY harsher on the CPU being 
that the code control will constantly be jumping through different 
classes, but very minor. I wanted to use this system so that I can 
develop the game in 2D now and "easily" port to 3D when I obtain an 
awesome graphics engine (and DX10 card).<br><br><b>The Mash-up</b><br>So
 many ideas and library's and all have been filling my head for this 
project. So I'm gonna try and keep writing things down so I don't 
forget. First off, continuing with OOP, is my next idea of Entities. Not
 original I know, BUT just wait. Like 3D entity's of B3D in being that 
everything is an entity I will do for this project. Even if it's 2D. But
 I want to expand it for more UNIVERSAL application. As in the entity 
class is universal, the parent coding won't care what type of entity, 
what it is, what it's for, nothing. All it will know is that it's some 
sort of game object or useful in some way. The entity class it's self 
will decifer what IT is, what actions should be taken based on that, and
 control other things. It's control should include what to do with Input
 values, when to play sounds, physics, logics, etc. <br><br>This project
 is also going to use all my other librarys and uutilities. Including 
PsychoScript3 (in development, it's amazing), ResGUI, InterDb, 
MicroPatch (in development), PsychoNet2 (in development), and a couple 
others.<br><br><b>The Game</b><br>Finally to what this is all about. To 
bad I can't tell you (I could die). Haha. Kidding, but for now it's 
secret. It's WIP Name is "Imperealize". And it involves being a 
community, raising stats, customization at it's fullest and having 
nearly full control in the games development and progress. Yes, 
development. This will be restricted to online only, but hey, so is 
steam. I'm gonna need servers and hosting and web domains and all. But 
that's what work is for.<br><br>I'll keep you all posted as soon as I can. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>ResGUI - Update</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2008-09-18)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 The module is coming along well. Three types have been created... 
TResourceHandler, TResource, and TDialog. And you only have to use the 
first one to create and control all the others.<br><br>100% of the MSDN 
declaired control types have been supported. Plus some extra lucky 
hidden ones (i.e. "msctls_updown32"). I'm adding custom-class support 
too. So<br>those lazy or hand-scripters who don't remember how to add a 
spinner (MSDN forgot to describe those...) they can just created the GUI
 element with the class MAXGUI_SPINNER. This way stuff that maxgui can 
do that editors don't can most likely be used anyways.<br><br>So far my example program to launch looks like this...<br><pre class="code">Global res:TResourceHandler = New TResourceHandler.Create("TempExample.brc")
res.BuildAll()
While True
   WaitEvent
