 The flight engine is still coming along nicely.  I've posted a couple 
of videos on YouTube.  Another cool thing is that I've been approached 
by an individual that is willing to help me bring it to fruition.<br><br>I

 This is the most serious I've ever been about completing a game, so I 
guess I'm gonna have to make a to-do list.  A few things off the top of 
my head are effects such as afterburner, wingtip contrails, engine glow,
 tracer bullet trails, and dust flying up if you land in the dirt.<br><br>I'm off work for 6 days so lets see what I can get done. <br><br> [Core2D][Sprite][MaxVerlet] </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Zama Flight Engine</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2007-09-26)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 I've been doing a lot of aerodynamics research lately and the scary 
thing is that I understand it now.  I now have the knowledge to write a 
moderately realistic flight sim.  The demo I showed a couple months ago 
is being revamped atm with all the new things I've learned.<br><br>I 
will say one thing that if you're trying to do what I'm doing (writing a
 flight sim)...once you figure out how to get the real angle of attack, 
the rest falls into place.  Because without the correct AOA, nothing 
will work.  A small hint is it's in radians in it's native form. &gt;:-)<br><br>I'm
 still looking for an aircraft to base the game around but it's not a 
major concern atm.  The flight engine is all that matters right now.  
Making sure all the linear and rotational forces are computed correctly 
is adamant.<br><br>Another cool thing I found was how to calculate the 
G-Forces a pilot experiences.  You find this out by simply dividing the 
Lift by the Weight of the aircraft (in Newtons).<br>If the Lift is 50000
 and the weight is 50000 then you are under 1 Gs of force (flying 
level).  If you're Lift is 100000 then Gs = 100000/50000 or 2 Gs.  Wings
 can handle a lot of pressure.  It's pretty crazy. <br><br> [Core2D][Sprite][MaxVerlet] </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Menial Stuffs</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2007-09-18)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Lately, I've been doing boring stuff like creating a fast lookup table 
that will give me the correct air density based on an altitude.  This 
way if you go above the aircraft's service ceiling you'll eventually 
stall out.  It was pretty easy to do actually.  My next task is 
perfecting the pitching of the plane. <br><br> [Core2D][Sprite][MaxVerlet] </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Flight Engine is back ON.</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2007-08-15)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> TFE was on hold while I studied for my next rank.  I'm happy to say that I passed the test WOOT!  Yay for a pay raise.<br><br>I'm
 again cranking up the tandem flight engine again.  My last demo has the
 basics in there but it had some major problems.  For one, the lift 
vector was only half right.  It seems the lift vector stays 
perpendicular to drag <b>AND</b> the wings lengthwise at the same time. 
 I finally got it nailed so now the lift vector is working 100% 
correctly in all phases of flight.  I have the 4 basic flight 
characteristics of thrust, drag, lift, and gravity all modeled 
correctly.  My next step is to model flight controls.  This shouldn't be
 too hard because all I have to do is calculate how much torque will be 
applied to the CG on it's respective axis based on airspeed and pilot 
inputs.<br><br>Now that I'm well versed in flight physics (serious!).  
I'm half tempted to use my newly purchase JV-ODE physics lib to do it 
all.  That would be a big help with the landing gear too.  I may do a 
test to see how it looks at least.<br><br>I'm still trying to choose the
 airplane for the game so if you have any ideas, please post them in the
 General Discussions forums in my Aircraft Vote thread.  I'm open to any
 suggestions.  Once I finish the flight physics 100% and select the 
airplane, the game should really take off.  I have like a bajillion guns
 and cannon code, smoke effects, explosions, etc etc ready to go.<br><br>No
 demo and no SS.  It might be a month or so before I have something to 
show but at least I'm hitting it up.  It won't be an Air War 1946 but 
it'll be something equally as cool. <br><br> [Core2D][Sprite][MaxVerlet] </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>(Not) On hold.

 The Tandem Flight Engine is my realistic flight physics engine I've 
been working on the past week.  No, I didn't write a flight engine in a 
week.  I started work on this in 2002 and then took a LONG break.  I 
picked it back up last week and made huge progress when I abandoned 
trying to use quaternions.  I now have a working flight physics model.<br><br>My
 favorite part at this point is landing.  You HAVE to keep the nose up 
(positive AoA) or you bite it.  The numbers aren't totally right but 
they're kinda close.  If I chop the throttle and give it about 8 degrees
 AoA and keep the airspeed at around 125 knots, it comes in like a real 
aiplane.  The lift coefficient increases with AoA increase so if you 
nose it down at low speed you're toast.  I'll post a screenshot later 
tonight. <br><br> [Core2D][Sprite][MaxVerlet] </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
