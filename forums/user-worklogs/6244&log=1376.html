 At War is a free-roaming space/trading shooter. It was originally to be
 written in DarkBASIC, and a playable demo of the engine exists in that 
form, but I made the hard decision to switch to Blitz3D and start from 
scratch. That move has paid off in spades.<br><br>The past fortnight has
 seen a lot of additions to the game, and development is speeding up now
 that most of the hard stuff is behind me:<br><br>-AI. The biggie. Ships
 can now be given goals and will happily go about them. They still get 
confused when their destination is almost directly above or below,  but 
they figure it out eventually. They can also take turns to dock with 
stations, and fly to the jumpgate without any difficulty. It's quite 
satisfying to see the universe populated by other ships at last.<br>-Effects.
 I'm adamant that this game isn't going to look as ugly as it did, so 
texture layers and spherical reflection maps are all in operation on the
 ships. This also allows for ships of different colours, although at the
 moment this tends to produce bad looking purple and bright green ships,
 as well as less garish results.<br><br>My main points of focus over the next week will be:<br>-Completing basic textures for the ships that are currently in-game.<br>-Working
 on the "unseenships" database. This basically entails the game 
"remembering" a ship when it docks or hyperspaces, so that it can launch
 later or be seen in another system if it hyperspaced ahead of the 
player. Eventually, this kind of persistance will be used in missions, 
so the player can follow other ships for assassination or spying 
purposes.<br>-Expanding the AI and setting up proper routines for 
generating ships. I want other ships to attack the player and each 
other, as well as ships being aware of each other's presence and being 
able to avoid crashing into each other.<br><br>That's all, folks. Screenshots soon, with a bit of luck.<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
