 The next version of MiniB3D will be quite a bit faster in two areas - 
skinned animations, and collisions. These two areas are probably the 
slowest aspect of MiniB3D in the current version, and so I've been 
working hard on making them as fast as possible. This has involved 
mainly rewriting the various routines to cut down on the amount of 
garbage created and also adding bits of C code.<br><br>Collisions are 
something that I've been bogged down with for quite a while now. They 
have been the last remaining sticking point of my game conversion - 
quite simply, with a few collision objects in a scene my game was 
running too slow. Collisions are now running at a much better speed, 
although there's still some work to do.<br><br>As for skinned 
animations, after a major rewrite of the bones system, you can now have 
many more animated meshes in a scene without things slowing down. On my 
fairly ancient setup, a scene with 100 animated birds that are all in 
view runs at 60fps, faster than Blitz3D.<br><br>I've also added VBO 
support in the next release, something which has been in klepto's 
version for a while and provides much faster rendering of large meshes.<br><br>I'll
 be glad when this update is done, as I want to concentrate more on the 
graphics side again. I'm getting increasingly enticed into the world of 
shader programming, but trying to resist for now... <br><br> Si. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>V0.42</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2007-06-13)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> V0.42 includes several fixes, nothing major though. I'll hopefully release it within the next three weeks.<br><br>I'm
 at something of a crossroads with MiniB3D, wondering what to do next. 
One area of disappointment expressed by users about MiniB3D is the speed
 of the collision and picking routines. This is mainly due to the 
over-reliance by MiniB3D on the vector type in the various maths 
routines - i.e. lots of small objects for the GC to deal with - which 
isn't BlitzMax's strong point. I can perform certain optimisations which
 I will do but I'm not sure I can get much more speed out of BMax alone.<br><br>So
 now I'm thinking about rewriting certain parts in C, this is slightly 
against my original mission (Max code only), although I'm sure it's OK 
for little bits here and there...<br><br>Finally, I've also been unsure 
whether to incorporate bits of the Blitz3D source code into MiniB3D. It 
was amazingly generous of Mark to make the B3D code available, but I 
feel a little hesitent about converting chunks of B3D to MiniB3D - maybe
 because that would take the skill/fun out of writing MiniB3D!<br><br>However
 I do appreciate the fact that converting parts of B3D to MiniB3D would 
make MiniB3D a more accurate conversion of B3D, which *is* the original 
point of the thing, so I'll probably end up nicking parts of it afterall
 (i.e. the difficult bits)!<br><br>So as you can see I've had several 
on-going dilemmas with where to take MiniB3D, which has halted progress 
somewhat. But hopefully things will start picking up again soon. <br><br> Si. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Octrees</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-12-17)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 The biggest addition to V0.4 is collisions. Collisions have been up and
 running for a while now but sphere -&gt; poly collision were a little 
too slow to be useable with large levels, as every triangle had to be 
checked.<br><br>After experimenting with BSPs for a while I eventually 
settled upon octrees as a way of reducing the triangle checks. Octrees 
are basically a way of partioning space, and in this instance the mesh 
(or rather a list of triangles representing the mesh) is split up into 
eight cubes, then each cube is split into eight more cubes and so on 
until each cube consists of a handful of triangles. If a collision check
 is made with a cube and returns false, then you don't need to check any
 sub cubes. This significantly reduces the no. of checks you need to 
make.<br><br>Finally you make checks with the triangles. To split a mesh
 into cubes you just need to clip the polys against a plane several 
times over.<br><br>I've just got octrees working with the picking 
commands and the performance increase is quite dramatic. Picking speed 
is now &lt;1ms for this teapot, whereas it was over 25 before. As you 
can see, the shaded regions indicate the different octree 'cubes'.<br><br><img src="6&amp;log=1369_files/octree_teapot.html"><br><br>Next
 up is to integrate octrees with sliding collisions. This is a little 
tricky as I need to add a swept-sphere-&gt;box collision check, but I 
don't anticipate it being a huge problem.<br><br>Octrees really are a 
very useful tool for game engines, not terribly difficult to use either,
 and I can think of a few more ways they can be used in MiniB3D. That 
will have to wait until after I've released 0.4 though as it's taking me
 far too long to finish this version as it is. <br><br> Si. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Update</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-03-14)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Well this is taking a little longer to complete than I would have hoped for but things are starting to come together now.<br><br>Currently

 MiniB3D is just something I'm quickly knocking together as I wish to 
port my game to the Mac and I can't really wait much longer for the 
official mod.<br><br>I started work at the start of the month and so far
 progress has been good, a full entity hierarchy system is in there, as 
is .b3d loading with multi-texturing. My aim is to replicate B3D's 
behaviour exactly in all areas, as this will make porting easier.<br><br>Next up is animation. <br><br> Si. </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
