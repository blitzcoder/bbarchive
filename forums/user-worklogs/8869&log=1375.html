 I've create as much as I feel i can release just a small techdemo for 
you guys explicit. It's not an official demo at all and lacks of lots of
 things (options for example :D) <br>Still take it or leave it, I hope I
 can work harder for you the next weeks so I can give you a proper demo 
in the end of the month.<br><br>If you do like it/hate it please I would like to know. Write a small comment in the Showcase-section in the community forum. <br>Thank you!<br><br>DEMO: <a href="http://archon2160.pbwiki.com/f/A2160TD.rar" target="_blank">http://archon2160.pbwiki.com/f/A2160TD.rar</a><br><br>note. The Djinni cannot be chosen by the both players in one game. Then it all is messy, icky and unplayable.

 I would compress all my designdocuments, visions and ideas into a few 
sentences I would say that this is all about creating the gameplay and 
multiplayerfun that Archon did deliver but still taking the concept into
 todays technology and graphics.<br>It's all about learning to play the 
12 different units and dive into several clashes with the opponent on 
the arena and still playing tactical on the "gameboard". Well, if you 
want to know more please visit the Archon 2160 wikipage at: 
http:\\archon2160.pbwiki.com<br><br>So here we go:<br>Archon2160 as an 
idea has been there for a long time but we started the development in 
Spring, 2006. We were a small dev.team where I was the Project Manager 
and Lead Artist. As time went by I realized that I was the only one 
contributing to the project I was burning for and in August, 2006 I 
decided to stop the project and try to find a whole new team. Now we all
 know that finding dedicated teammembers is hard so eventually I decided
 to start programming it myself. After a short while I decided to use 
Blitz3D (as Im a pretty lousy programmer) and this is my very first 
project in B3D so PLEASE be gentle with me and don't hammer to hard 
cause Im actually a little bit proud of achieving this much already.<br><br>I've now been working on this for a week (yes I didnt find the Worklogs until now :P) and this is what Ive got so far:<br><br>2 Playable units (to be able to play 2player you need at least 1 gamepad/joystick)<br>2 Playable guns (Flamethrower and Grenadelauncher)<br>2 different controllingtypes (8-way and carsteering)<br>Working HUD (at least the energy and weaponstatusbars)<br>Working Effects and particlesystems<br>Working Collisionsystem<br>Animated obstacles on the arena (nades still go through them (?) )<br><br><img src="8869&amp;log=1375_files/Screen1.html"><br><img src="8869&amp;log=1375_files/FirstScreen.html"><br><br>Thanks
 for reading this first post and I hope there will be a lot more soon. 
My intentions is to release a first Demo within the next few days. <br><br> Andreas Jirenius<br><br><a href="http://www.solodev.eu/" target="_blank">http://www.solodev.eu</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
