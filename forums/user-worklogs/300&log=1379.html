I wrote a lengthy worklog a few days back, but it seems to have vanished. Anyway.<br><br>I'm
 working hard to try and get v1.12 out some time this week. It's turning
 out to be a bigger update than expected, but I guess that's a good 
thing.<br><br>I've just made the loading and saving functions stream 
smart. It's a small change that won't affect most, but it does mean that
 ".plb" and ".plz" files can now be IncBin-ed. The more stream savvy can
 also do a few more imaginative things.<br><br>I've re-jigged some of the internal referancing, switching from lists, <b>slooow</b>, to managed arrays, <i>fast</i>.
 This is a major internal shake-up so there may be a some teething 
trouble and a couple of unforseen issues, but it gives a big speed boost
 to PhysicsUpdate and allows for some other positive tweaks. One 
consession is that TAdvBody objects are now referanced internally and 
must be manually freed, but this should be the only change that affects 
existing code.<br><br>I'm going to add in some higher-order-<i>esque</i>
 functionality too. Mainly to use internally, but I'll expose them for 
those that might find them useful. For those that don't know, this means
 that you'll be able to apply a single function to whole collections in 
one go. As you can imagine doing this a lot would be slow, but used in 
the right way it can be extremely useful. An example of this could be, 
if you wish to <i>Freeze</i> all the active TMass objects:<pre class="code">MassApplyToActive MassFreeze</pre><br>Or how about drawing all the TAdvBody objects in one line of code:<pre class="code">AdvBodyApplyToAll AdvBodyDraw</pre><br><br>I'm
 also removing the examples and tutorials from the update file and 
giving them a permanent download link. I was aware with so many examples
 and tutorials in the update it was getting a little cluttered. This 
will also allow others to see how coding with PhysLite looks without 
having to purchase. <br><br> DaveW<br><br><img src="300&amp;log=1379_files/smallblob.gif"><b>PhysLite[</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/phys.html" target="_blank">Info</a><b>]<img src="300&amp;log=1379_files/smallblob.gif">ODD.mod[</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/mods/odd2dmodule.zip" target="_blank">Odd2D.mod</a><b>][</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/temp/aspectmodule.zip" target="_blank">Aspect.mod</a><b>][</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/temp/asciifontmodule.zip" target="_blank">AsciiFont.mod</a><b>]</b><br>"When you're the last man standing and still packing nukes you don't need experience points."<i> - Brian Van Hoose</i> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Help!</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-02-02)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">

of the functions as possible, but with hundreds of functions in the 
documentation it may take some time. I am also going to be adding to the

 The collision zone editor is almost done. Using it is a snap and it 
speeds up PhysLite development immensely. I've just got a couple of 
features to add before putting out a public release.<br><br>v1.11 is 
almost done as well. It's a fairly big update, especially for collision 
zones, but most of the new methods are geared towards making editors for
 your PhysLite games. v1.11 has been a little delayed as I'm making it 
into a straight module as well as the usual include. The big benefit of 
this is inline help and function/method highlighting. This means I need 
to check all the bbdoc help entries to check I've not done anything 
squiffy.

 My hate/hate relationship with MaxGUI continues. The collision zone 
editor (ZED) is coming along nicely, however, due to my inability to 
shoehorn MaxGUI into any form of OO-ness I have abandoned my principles 
and gone completely procedural for the editor. This means the code will 
be a lot neater, if not completely 'clean'.<br><br>ZED has had the knock
 on effect, as I knew it would, of improving PhysLite's TZone type. 
There are tons of new methods and functions, and a few improvements and 
bug-fixes too. Quad tree's got a big optimization boost and I've cleaned
 up some of the TZone internals. All in all I'm very happy with my

 I realised this week that PhysLite has been in development, in one form
 or another, for more than three years, and later this year will have 
been on sale for two years. During that time it has seen one complete 
rewrite, 10 updates with update 11 in the works as we speak, one full 
blown editor with a second currently in development, and the source 
expand to nearly 5,000 lines of code containing approx. 500 types, 
methods and functions. All told it has been a mammoth undertaking with 
many high and low points along the way. It is in this mood of nostalgia 
that I have decided to reduce the price of PhysLite licenses for the 
month of January. So I guess if you haven't already joined the wonderful
 world of PhysLite now is the ideal time to join us. Check out the <a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/phys.htm" target="_blank">website</a> for more info. and payment details.<br><br>On
 the development side I have plowed into ZED, the TZone editor. It's 
still early days, but I've had a little more free time over the holidays
 so it's been progressing nicely. I also added the ability to pack your 
advanced body images directly into the .plb file. This was my intention 
from the start, but I'd always put off doing it for one reason or 
another. I'm glad I did as I recently came accross a very eligant way of
 implementing this which only needed the addition of four lines of code.

 First of all let me blow the cobwebs off this worklog. *Phoo* I guess 
it's been a while since I've added an entry. You'll all be happy to know
 my time away hasn't been wasted. PhysLite just hit v1.10 and I've just 
put together the first BETA build of the Advanced Body Editor. During 
the making of the editor there have been many additions to the engine 
which means v1.10 was a fairly major update. All PhysLite owners should 
have recieved the update by now, if not send me an email. A few worklog

I've been working on the first <a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/phys.htm" target="_blank">PhysLite</a> editor this month. It's the <i>Advanced Body Editor</i>, or <i>ABE</i>
 for short, and I'm finding using MaxGUI a real nightmare. This will be 
the third application I've made using MaxGUI and I still don't seem to 
be able to get the hang of creating a clean implimentation. I'm sure 
MaxGUI is great when in the right hands but it just doesn't seem to work
 intuatively to me. Anyway enough of my inadiquacies, the editor itself 
is actually working well. There are two methods of editing elements of a
 body, visually, or manually. Visual editing is done straight in the 
canvas and is a WYSIWYG style of editing. Manual editing is done using 
textfields and gadgets, and is more for tweaking values or getting very 
precise values. Currently mass, constraint, and over-all body editing is
 in and next up is rig and image editing. I'm actually considering 
expanding the usefulness of the TRig object to allow image scaling, 
tint, alpha, etc. turning it into a bit more of a complete sprite 
system. I know in a previous worklog I said I didn't want to expand it 
in this way, but I think it can only be a benefit if I do. <i>ABE</i> 
will initially be released as a Windows executable until the bugs are 
ironed out and whilst I document it. Then I'll release the source and 
see about getting a Mac and Linux build made.<br><br>After <i>ABE</i> is complete I will begin working on the <i>Zone EDitor</i>, or <i>ZED</i> as it will be known.

 Wow! Has it really been two months since the last update? I'd like to 
say that I've spent all that time working non-stop on PhysLite, but alas
 life is such that I've barely been able to touch it. The only real 
update is that I've added the ability to rotate the simulation drawing. 
This is a tough one to get your head round at first. It basically means 
that the simulation stays exactly as it is, but when it is drawn the 
whole thing appears rotated. Think LocoRoco/2D Super Monkey Ball and 
you'll get the idea.<br><br>My ToDo list is actually very small so once 
it's emptied I'm gonna start work on the object editors. Jake L has 
already started on an excellent looking editor. Not sure if he's 
planning to release it to the community, but I want to have an 
official-ish editor anyway. My intention is for the entire PhysLite 
library of functions to be as editor friendly as possible, so people can
 easily make their own game specific editors. Making my own editors will
 give me a chance to iron out any issues in that respect, and possibly 
give others a little insight into how it's done. <br><br> DaveW<br><br><img src="300&amp;log=1379_files/smallblob.gif"><b>PhysLite[</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/phys.html" target="_blank">Info</a><b>]<img src="300&amp;log=1379_files/smallblob.gif">ODD.mod[</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/mods/odd2dmodule.zip" target="_blank">Odd2D.mod</a><b>][</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/temp/aspectmodule.zip" target="_blank">Aspect.mod</a><b>][</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/temp/asciifontmodule.zip" target="_blank">AsciiFont.mod</a><b>]</b><br>"When you're the last man standing and still packing nukes you don't need experience points."<i> - Brian Van Hoose</i> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Collisions and Events</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2007-07-09)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Well I've been hard at work on PhysLite this past week, and I've just 
finished up the collision events code. Collision events give your game 
feedback for the collisions that occured during the previous update. 
This was a lot of work and involved a couple of false starts, but in the
 end I've gone for a system similar to the standard events system 
already within BlitzMax. This means that collision events can be handled
 in several ways. You can use BlitzMax's <i>Hook</i> functions to intercept events as they happen, <i>Poll</i> events from the collision events queue, or you can <i>Seek</i>
 a collision event by choosing two objects to see if a collision occured
 between the two. In fact if you wish you can use all these methods 
together to give maximum flexability. Each collision event has a 
position and force, and of course the objects involved. It's also 
possible to create your own custom collision events, although I have no 
idea why you'd wish to. So far it seems reliable and fast. I'm just 
cleaning up the code before documenting it, and I hope to have it 
finished up on Wednesday sometime.<br><br>As promised I released a 
stress test to get some feedback on PhysLites performance on different 
specs. The results were good and consistant, and I was pleased by the

 This week I've overhauled the internals of the drawing commands. They 
still work the same, but this allowed me to add a scrolling and zooming 
system. Now scrolling and zooming can be done with just two commands. No
 complicated math, just tell PhysLite which part of the simulation you 
want to display and how zoomed in/out you want to draw and PhysLite 
works out all the math for you. Also added a drawing method for 
collision zones to compliment those for bodies. However I'm very 
conscious that I don't want to turn PhysLite into a sprite system. The 
drawing commands should, and will, always be secondary to the physics.<br>I
 also spent some time on the collision zones. I've added a new style, 
hole, which is the inverse of fill. And after a suggestion from <i>Jake L</i>
 I've added custom collision responses. In fact Jake's example code 
could have been plugged straight into PhysLite, but I decided on a 
similar but subtly different approach.<br>Still no screenshots for you,

 Well finally finished the advanced body type. Loading saving and 
copying all seem to be working correctly. Had a couple of issues, but 
hopefully I've ironed them out after I went on a major bug hunt. It's 
turned out very well and is a big improvement on the code I had written 
for PhysMax. However it's also very different to the PhysMax code so it 
looks like I'll have to scrap the editor I'd written for PhysMax and 
start a new one. But the PhysLite code is far easier to use so hopefully
 it won't be too much work. Also all the moving code is in too. Now a 
body can be moved, translated, positioned, rotated, spun or turned as a 
single object, whilst still allowing all the individual components to be
 manipulated seperatly. <br><br> DaveW<br><br><img src="300&amp;log=1379_files/smallblob.gif"><b>PhysLite[</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/phys.html" target="_blank">Info</a><b>]<img src="300&amp;log=1379_files/smallblob.gif">ODD.mod[</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/mods/odd2dmodule.zip" target="_blank">Odd2D.mod</a><b>][</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/temp/aspectmodule.zip" target="_blank">Aspect.mod</a><b>][</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/temp/asciifontmodule.zip" target="_blank">AsciiFont.mod</a><b>]</b><br>"When you're the last man standing and still packing nukes you don't need experience points."<i> - Brian Van Hoose</i> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Following procedure</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2007-06-22)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 I got a little side tracked this week and added all the procedural 
functions. Now the lib can be used completely procedurally if that's 
your fancy. I did get some work done on the advanced body type and now 
there's only six(edit: make that five now) more methods to add. They are
 however the most complex methods, but hopefully shouldn't be too much 
longer. Then there's the small matter of documenting it all. PhysLite is
 now well over 2000 lines of code so I've split it into three source 
files. This should hopefully help make it more understandable and easier
 to use. <br><br> DaveW<br><br><img src="300&amp;log=1379_files/smallblob.gif"><b>PhysLite[</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/phys.html" target="_blank">Info</a><b>]<img src="300&amp;log=1379_files/smallblob.gif">ODD.mod[</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/mods/odd2dmodule.zip" target="_blank">Odd2D.mod</a><b>][</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/temp/aspectmodule.zip" target="_blank">Aspect.mod</a><b>][</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/temp/asciifontmodule.zip" target="_blank">AsciiFont.mod</a><b>]</b><br>"When you're the last man standing and still packing nukes you don't need experience points."<i> - Brian Van Hoose</i> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Building a better body</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2007-06-08)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> I've been mainly working on the advanced body type, <i>TAdvBody</i>, this week.

components allowing loading, copying and saving, as well as the usual 
moving and positioning. This will nearly double the amount of functions

 I suppose PhysLite requires a little explination. PhysMax was becoming a
 beast to maintain and I was unable to give it the time it deserved. As a
 result it's all encompassing brief was scaled down and became the new 
brief for PhysLite. This has extended the scope of PhysLite, but to a 
much more managable level than PhysMax.<br><br><i>Development news</i><br>I
 re-added shifted grid collision culling. I've decided to make it 
manually configured as setting the grid cells too small can break the 
simulation. This allows the programmer to tryout different size grids to
 see which performs best. Eventually I'd like to automate it, but this 
works for now. I've also added a new tutorial and I've started work on a

 I suppose I'd better mention what I've actually got done. I've added 
some debug drawing code. What these functions do is draw the physics 
data on the display so that collision areas and the like can be seen 
visually. I also went back and reviewed the friction code. Friction is 
by far the most complicated part of the simulation, and maybe it's a 
little too complicated for a verlet integration. Currently I'm using the
 coulomb cone, or infact circle in 2D, method and it gives extremely 
realictic results. Well I've re-jigged it a little and I've now got two 
different friction models running. I'll have to see over the coming

 This was mainly a compatibility test, to make sure the module actually 
worked on computers other than my own. There'll be more demos to come 
but they'll all be pointless if I don't finish the actual module. So 
this week I dived back into the code for <b>PhysLite</b>. Mainly adding 
extra functionality, but also trying a few optimizations. Even though 
the module is quite fast I'd like it to be faster. I've found the main 
speed issue is iterating through all the collision checks. I tried a 
shifted grid collision cull which was lightning fast, but unfortunatly 
the simulation became a little jittery when many objects were all 
bunched tightly together. I think the issue was objects changing sectors
 mid check due to their collision responses. Anyway, I've had to scrap 
that method for now. It was just <i>too</i> jittery. <br><br> DaveW<br><br><img src="300&amp;log=1379_files/smallblob.gif"><b>PhysLite[</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/phys.html" target="_blank">Info</a><b>]<img src="300&amp;log=1379_files/smallblob.gif">ODD.mod[</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/mods/odd2dmodule.zip" target="_blank">Odd2D.mod</a><b>][</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/temp/aspectmodule.zip" target="_blank">Aspect.mod</a><b>][</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/temp/asciifontmodule.zip" target="_blank">AsciiFont.mod</a><b>]</b><br>"When you're the last man standing and still packing nukes you don't need experience points."<i> - Brian Van Hoose</i> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Slow progress</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-12-05)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Been working on the <b>PhysMax</b> module this week and more specifically on the Body Loading functions. <b>PhysMax</b>

 I went back to work this week so I've not been able to dedicate a lot 
of time to this project. However, due to my continuing insomnia, I did 
manage to finish the editor. It still needs a little tweaking here and 
there, and I'm sure I'll add some extra functionality after I've used it

 It's been all boring editor stuff this week. Not my favourite thing to 
do, but necessary non the less. Managed to get most of it done.

 and images can be rigged up to the constraints. Next to do is the

 It's been over a month and nothings happened. Not my fault though as I 
was taken seriously ill and hospitalised, but enough about me. I've 
decided to split the project up into two seperate mods <b>PhysLite</b> and <b>PhysMax</b>.<br><br><b>PhysLite</b><br>This
 will contain only the physics code and nothing else. The idea being 
that PhysLite deals only with the physics. Displaying the results has to
 be dealt with else where. This part is complete although I'm sure when I
 get round to thoroughly testing it some bugs will rear their ugly 
heads.<br><br><b>PhysMax</b><br>This mod however will contain other 
useful automated sollutions for things like loading objects, and 
displaying images based on the physics simulation. I'm doing a little 
re-organising to this to automate it as much as possible. This means for
 simple situations an object can be loaded with one comand and is 
imediatly ready to interact with the rest of the simulation. This is not
 meant to be an all encompasing sollution as the games I have in mind 
for using this mod will require some specialised functionality.<br><br><b>The Editor</b><br>In
 my last worklog I eluded to the fact that I was working on an object 
editor. Well when I finally made it back to my computer and fired up the
 editor code I realised that a complete rewrite would have to be done.

 PhysMax will be a 2D physics module for Blitz Max. The project is 
already quite advanced, and the reason I'm starting a worklog so late on
 is to keep me motivated to see it through to completion.<br><br><b>The module</b><br>
	The physics part is all done. You can create bodies, give them mass, 
stiffness, friction, etc. You can create scenery and bounds for the 
bodies to interact with. Then set them loose. It's all very stable and 
save for a few optimisations is complete. Still to do however is 
collision feedback. Whilst bodies already respond to collisions 
accurately there are times when you what more info about the collisions 
for sound and visual effects. This is where collision feedback comes in.
 You'll be able to get information on collision locations, force, etc.<br><br><b>The Editor</b><br>
	This is the part I'm working on now. It's tough going. I prefer the fun
 stuff of letting my little physics objects bounce around, and I'm not 
to keen on doing the boring stuff like checking editor buttons do what 
there supposed to. At the moment you can create, place and size masses, 
and you can join them all together with constraints. Next step is to add
 parameter editting such as friction, stiffness, etc. Then finally tie 
it all together with a file format for loading them straight into the 
engine.<br><br>I'm sure there's more I've left out, but I'll save all that for a later worklog. <br><br> DaveW<br><br><img src="300&amp;log=1379_files/smallblob.gif"><b>PhysLite[</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/phys.html" target="_blank">Info</a><b>]<img src="300&amp;log=1379_files/smallblob.gif">ODD.mod[</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/mods/odd2dmodule.zip" target="_blank">Odd2D.mod</a><b>][</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/temp/aspectmodule.zip" target="_blank">Aspect.mod</a><b>][</b><a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/temp/asciifontmodule.zip" target="_blank">AsciiFont.mod</a><b>]</b><br>"When you're the last man standing and still packing nukes you don't need experience points."<i> - Brian Van Hoose</i> </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
