 As if I don't have enough projects that are 'mostly done', I am now 
mostly done with BZIP, a bb include that will allow you to use standard 
zip files for your media. I have the 'fixed huffman encoding' part done,
 now I have to start on the 'dynamic huffman encoding' part. It has been
 tough going, but I have learned quite a lot about bit manipulation. 
This will only UNZIP the files, you still will have to use winzip or 
pkzip to compress the files.<br><br>My progress has slowed down, 
however, thanks to the invasion of my house by The Sims, which I 
stupidly gave to my wife for xmas, and now my computer at home is tied 
up most of the time!!!<br><br>Happy 2002<br> <br><br> ======================================= </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>several projects</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2001-12-01)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 I am currently using every bit of free time I can steal from my work, 
my wife and my kids to program several different projects in B3d/BB.<br><br>One
 is a full-featured tilemap editor for 2d platform/scroller type games. 
With multiple layers of tiles/objects, tiles of any size, user-definable
 variables (to store with the map file for things like # of 
baddies,points,etc.). This project will be based on my Blitz 
Boulders/'Rock Runner' map editor in the showcase. Project is on hold as
 I try to complete other projects.<br><br>Next is a fairly-uncrackable 
encryption program using an algorithm I came up with when working with 
Lee (Terabit) on the security of his PAK file routines. This is mostly 
done, but needs a GUI as soon as I pick which one out there I like 
best...<br><br>Third is SNARKTRIS 3d - a 3d version of, yeah you know 
that other program with the falling bricks... This one is about 50% 
done, but I need to re-write the collision schemes from the top. This is
 my only *potentially* commercial project. I've got some cool music my 
brother made with PRO-TOOLS to go along with this.<br><br>Fourth is the 
project I am currently working on the most, hoping to get it done in 
time for the xmas comp. deadline. This started out as a 2d 
side-scroller/platformer version of a popular "2 and 1/2 D" FPS, using 
mainly the original games graphics and sounds. But then I thought it 
would be even <i>cooler</i> to do it as a 2d-in-3d! So now, it's a 2 
1/2D-in-2D-in-3d which I am pretty sure hasn't been done... if you have 
to know which game I'm talking about see my website...<br><a href="http://www.pacificadhesives.com/tfsanford/tims.htm" target="_blank">Here</a><br><br>Happy Coding, Everyone!<br> <br><br> ======================================= </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
