 Widget classes with buttons and input fields, complete with coll. 
detection for when you click the mouse on/in them, and start typing<br><br>* New collisions, pixel perfect this time around. Can have about 18k balls moving before slowdown below 60fps<br><br>* Added new brick types<br><br>*
 Added color sliders for various colored bricks in the editor. Also 
added move-snapping, duplication, copy to clipboard/paste to clipboard.<br><br>* Made a better menu system + highscores<br><br>*
 Started messing around with network. The plan is to have a server 
running, which accepts connections from the game for uploading 
highscores and replays. Server has been written and successful encrypted
 connections done from the game, working beautifully. Now it's just a 
matter of making the sql, which is dead easy.<br><br>* Scratched the 
surface on replays and had some play back. Plan is for people to upload 
their replays alongside with their highscores. Initial testing showed 
replay of 2 minutes being about 100kb(unpacked).<br><br><br>A few old 
screenshots (although they don't show much, the graphics are just really
 quickly made placeholders. Once the mechanics are all set, I will take 
necessary time to make way better graphics)<br><br><img src="9341&amp;log=1321_files/ark4.jpg"><br><br><br><img src="9341&amp;log=1321_files/ark3.jpg"> <br><br> -----------<br>Workstation: Win7 x64.

 I've been working on and off on this arkanoid/breakout clone for a 
while now, about 40 hours tops. Keep in mind that I'm very inexperienced
 in the world of programming and such :)<br><br>Summary of what I've made so far:<br>* Collisions, pretty simple stuff mostly, but it works.<br>* Startup logo and gameover screen.<br>*
 Various powerups and a powerup-handling system. Made about 10 powerups 
so far. Speed up, speed down, ball size up, ball size down, 
multi/extraballs +3,+5,+9,+15.. multiply balls x2 and x3.. paddle 
stretch, paddle narrow, etc.<br>* Powerup handling system spawns all 
powerups and hides them "inside" of bricks when level is loaded. Also 
possibility to have them generated randomly, or user defined in the 
level<br>* Made some cheezy particle effects and explosions when bricks 
are killed. These will be improved mucho once I get to the polishing 
stage and actually focus on graphics :)<br>* Made a kind of sound 
system, to keep track of all channels playing and close them down 
automatically if they're not playing anything.<br>* Matrix mode when pushing RMB, causing everything to slow down to 1/10th speed, including music and sound<br>*
 Currently working on the editor, which is currently brought up by 
pressing 'e'. You can now drag bricks around, duplicate them by holding 
shift and dragging. Lots of work to be done here though, but it's fun :)<br><br>Future stuff I must do:<br>*
 More powerups; ball cannon, laser cannon, no-clipping balls, ball on 
fire causing bricks to detonate etc., lifesaver makes a boundary below 
the paddle which breaks on ball impact, extraball<br>* More 
"bummer"-ups. Reverse of powerups, stuff people don't want to pickup. 
Mirrormode, spawns an exact paddle copy, only it's mirrored.. mirrormode
 also for balls, should get confusing :) <br>* Small minigames such as a brick coming into the screen, and you have x seconds to hit it, granting a reward.<br>* Random powerups, akin to shuffling powerups from the SNES mariokart. <br><br> -----------<br>Workstation: Win7 x64.
