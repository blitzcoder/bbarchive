 Well now you can actually shoot other NPC's, there has been loads of 
other bits done under the hood and im working on all manner of other 
sections.<br><br>Currently im adding different types of AI and testing 
it to get the game as good as it can be and give the best experience for
 the players. I am also adding different damage effects and once they 
are in I will be updating the entire demo.<br><br>On the whole front I 
am also adding in the sections for player information screens, and the 
docking screens. Once the whole screens and stuff are in there I will be
 working on the 'GALACTIC MAP' yes the entire galaxy so the players can 
then move around the entire thing.<br><br>The uploaded version is a demo
 and will be restricted to the starting system, the full version of the

 Well I have started the NPC's I can create the NPCs and see them in the
 game (same as player ship at present till more are done) I also have a 
naming system, a ship ID system and a company name system. All of these 
will also be used to do stuff for the new service which will feature in 
the ISN system. Those who have played Star Flight 2000 back in 'well' 
2000 will know what I mean, on the whole its working rather flawlessly 
which is a big plus.<br><br>Im currently working on the NPC AI so they 
actually fly around and depending on their choice of brain may decide to
 ignore you, scan you or downright try to blast you into the cosmos

 Well for those who actually have been keeping an eye on the html5 demo 
over the past few weeks will notice that its been moving ever forwards, 
over the last week we have added the following:<br><br>1) BIG space stations - the graphic atm is a placeholder but the stations are huge.<br><br>2) Zoom - yes its back, I tried a velocity based zoom but it didnt sit right for the game<br><br>3) Instructions - this shows the keys etc for the game<br><br>4) Afterburners - these were adjusted they still arent 100% perfect but with velocity lock is quite amusing<br><br>5)
 Shooting - you can show fire shots off into space, at present there is 
nothing to shoot but this is being worked on right now.<br><br>Currently
 im adding in the NPC's these ruthless pilots or panicking cannon fodder
 are going to make the whole universe less empty they will fly around 
the universe, sometimes they may even attack you. On the whole the 
entire game is coming together really nicely and the NPC's are one of 
the major  milestones especially with the combat system etc.<br><br>After
 that I will add in the screens for module placement, internal ship view
 and planetary landings etc. Also the information screens and docking 
stuff.<br><br>More soon... <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>playable demo...</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2015-04-15)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> We have a playable demo out now on <a href="http://www.edzup.co.uk/SRDemo/SRDemo.html" target="_blank">http://www.edzup.co.uk/SRDemo/SRDemo.html</a><br><br>This is updated regularly and I'm currently working on Space Stations and NPCs :) <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>HTML5</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2015-02-17)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">

 Well heres another progress report for the game, the planets are much 
better as well now that I have redesigned the planet using GIMP. What I 
have to add now is a modular space station for the game and design the 
internal sections of the ships so the player will be able to move around
 them.<br><br>For the HTML5 version I will add the data for the Aradis 
system as the target doesnt support file loading so I will have to put 
the files data into the game as code so it can be loaded.<br><br>On the 
graphics front I am also starting to add the planets and other images 
into sprite sheets so that the game will load better on HTML5 once thats
 done the game should open better and allow the demo to be released for

 the Framework front I have fixed the FileSystem class so it will

build for the game.<br><br>Next thing to sort is some small glitches with HTML5 and the planet scaling in the game.<br><br>This is a exciting game to be making and once its complete I will be releasing it on all platforms that monkey supports :)<br><br>On
 the whole the Unity version doesn't work using the webplayer all I get

 Well as you know I have created (in my oppinion) beautiful nebula 
clouds for Star Rogue (see screenshots below), after thinking about 
using Unity for the project (stop looking horrified) I thought I would 
test the best part of Star Rogue and create some nebulas.<br><br>Well 
long story short I have a system that makes the sprites and then allows 
me to attach the spacedust.cs script to them and sends em on their way. 
All is fine apart from in the nebula I get 20-40fps on a 2Ghz laptop 
with 2Gb ram, in comparison my monkey attempt gets a stonking 30-50fps 
in nebulas AND I have much more going on. At present the monkey version 
does look incredible in comparison to the Unity version as I 'also' have
 to have two cameras due to the background and zoom features.<br><br>EDIT:
 well I fixed that to find that there is a problem that the game doesnt 
play in the Unity web player, after this fraggin annoyance I have 
decided to say sod it and see about forgoing the internet web game idea 
completely in prelude to a loverly desktop/android version made with 
monkey. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Getting there...</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2015-01-17)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">

 After having a look at the Unity system, the whole procedural texture 
system we have currently and the whole 2d vs 3d debate, we have decided 
to make the entire game 2d. Before ya gasp in horror the reasons for 
this are million fold as I will explain:<br><br>1) Star flight the game all this is based upon was top down 2d this is the art direction we are using now.<br><br>2)
 with 3d using the original system I could have -65535 to 65536 sectors 
of space on the x,y,z now this is big but some of the bigger systems are
 off scale and tend to look a little screwy.<br><br>3) system sizes have
 been increased to -2billion to 2billion on the x and y, if the project 
does go 3d eventually then it would be z as well.<br><br>4) already just
 last night I have coded infinite asteroids, nebulae, mine fields and 
open space areas this lends weight to the new huge system ideal.<br><br>5)
 flying off the outer edge of the system will now put you in 
interstellar space (original star flight) where you can navigate to 
another system or reenter your the last one.<br><br>6) jump gates will 
now transport you to another system in the game which could be anywhere 
on the game map, likewise wormholes just transport you to a sector x,y 
and a offset x,y so you could end up deep in interstellar space.<br><br>7)
 the galaxy map has changed to be like sf2000's where it was billions of
 sectors across, there will be predefined systems for each race but 
there will also be procedurally generated ones for the rest.<br><br>8) 
we have a system in place so you can build your ship from components so 
you can make it as fast or as armed as you like it this is also nice as 
we also want the player to be able to make their own components if they 
have the blueprints.<br><br>9) The whole project is being coded using 
monkey, it could have been Unity but monkey is very very lightweight for
 this sort of project and I don't need overbearing 3d for it at all just
 paste, move and rotate. I also have EdzUp framework for just this sort 
of game :)<br><br>As soon as I sort the nebula density I will post a screenshot atm it looks like we hit a really dense cloud :) <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Closed</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2014-10-05)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Well we have decided to go with Unity in the end for the project, I 
have a semi working monkey version as you see but in the end the project
 hit a wall. In this case the wall was entities in the game being 
'terminated' for no apparent reason its as so the data behind them was 
being deleted without required it to be done (the only thing that flags 
it is if they are 4000 units from the player and these ships were right 
next to the player).<br><br>To this end I have canned the monkey version
 of the game and im going to Unity for all future developments, those

 Well as those that have been following the progress of Star Rogue will 
know I have been looking at different game styles for the game, I have 
settled on Frontier though mainly because sf2000 was based on Frontier 
but with Elites controls. As it stood at the time I wanted to play 
Frontier but thought there was two problems with the game. One problem 
was physics in the game and it seemed that loads of people had the same 
issue, secondly the entire universe was rather empty. After discovering 
DarkBasic (now classic) I decided to look at procedural generation to 
see if it could be done, after a year of constant work on it Star Flight
 2000 was born ( <a href="http://www.edzup.co.uk/images/sf2000.zip" target="_blank">http://www.edzup.co.uk/images/sf2000.zip</a> ).<br><br>Star
 Rogue is my next version set in the same vein as sf2000 but with much 
more than the original game and more complete. As everyone who has been 
on the forums will know I have loads and loads of prototypes and data 
but this one is much more further along than any other.<br><br>Over the 
last week I have added the Hyper tunnel and I have NPCs started which is
 about 75% ccomplete for the first iteration with tweaks later. Once 
they are all in there I will look to then galaxy map :)<br><br>After all that the BBS system will be worked on and other sections like combat etc :)<br><br>More soon... <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Stage 1 complete</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2014-09-20)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Well the editor is complete so I can move forwards with the game 
engine, to the frontier end I have been looking at the whole system and 
reworking bits. One marvellous upshot of this is system creation is down
 on my laptop from four seconds to just over one, I will test the new 
generator on android later so I can move forwards with the rest.<br><br>Next
 up will be finalising hyperspace, this I want to be like sf2000s where 
the hypertunnel is shown when going between systems. With this new 
system and adjustments it has made the hypoertunnel possible :)<br><br>I
 still have to finalise npcs and stations but they will make the game 
almost complete, after that its info screens, maps, dock screens, menus 
and saving and loading :)<br><br>More soon... <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>files...</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2014-09-16)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">

 Well today I have started coding the danger zones for Star Rogue these 
will take the form of either simple nebulae to much more well dangerous 
things like rad zones or minefields.<br><br>On the whole game wise the 
player will see these at a distance rather than stumbling blindly into 
them so you should be able to avoid them if its possible.<br><br>Another
 thing I have added is a mesh/texture area so I can specify either a 
special mesh/texture etc for things like planets, stations, asteroids 
etc it will enable me to add things so the player can go sight seeing 
around the universe as well this will make up another area for the 
player to have fun :)<br><br>On the game front I have squashed a nasty bug I had which caused the game to crash on android devices so that's a good thing.<br><br>More soon... <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>even more progress...</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2014-08-20)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Well today I finalised the wrecks in the game, these little beasties 
will be just items in the game that will be floating in space and will 
drop cargo when shot. As with everything in space there is a downside 
this (like in Freelancer) is a damage field around them that will damage
 the player when they are in it this is the price for trying to get the 
cargo.<br><br>Unlike Freelancer though not all ships will have usable 
cargo its down to the player to decide what they go for also the game 
itself will 'randomize' some of the items so not all wrecks will be the 
same every time you play yup yet another gamble.<br><br>I have to say 
coding in monkey does feel rather fresh and seems in some cases easier 
than max but as with everything there are downsides like losing access 
to lower level stuff like image manipulation but im sure it could be 
possible with something but I havent tried that yet.<br><br>On the editor front all I have to do now is;<br>1) Danger zones - yes these are asteroid fields, nebulae, mines etc<br><br>2) Specials - these are things that dont fit any of the other categories could be things like huge space debris etc.<br><br>3) Saving and Loading - always handy and required LOL :)<br><br>4) Editing - yes after everything is placed its always handy to be able to move it around afterwards :D<br><br>5)
 Base system information - this is things like the star system 
description, year it was discovered/settled etc just back story to give 
the game another layer of information that makes it more fun. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>more progress</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2014-08-18)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Well after finding this worklog again (forgot it was here lol), i have decided to add another entry :)<br><br>well
 i am now working on the editor for the game this will enable me to make
 all the systems on my tablet so i can push productivity through the 
roof as i can use my tablet anywhere :).<br><br>i am still looking for 
making the procedural generator but the levels designed for the game 
will allow me to set out a much better and richer back story and other 
stuff.<br><br>on the whole game front i have started creating the GUI 
for the editor which works brilliantly and is portable to things like c 
etc. Also thanks to Pharmhaus i have an updater system so i can update 
Star Rogue from the website, basically this means all i have to do is 
release a game exe and base systems then the game will check on starting
 to see if there is any new levels available and will download them as 
required :)<br><br>once i finish the last editor sections and put the 
first levels up i will finalise the downloader and get the first system 
of Star Rogue complete then release another demo :)<br><br>more soon... <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>more progress...</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2014-05-30)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Well after a lot of head scratching i have managed to cobble together a
 simple data file system to protect my media and game. There are still a
 few kinks to fix but its getting there.<br><br>on the game front i have
 added cameras to the mix and have started replacing the tired old 
fourteen year old graphics with more upto date stuff.<br><br>on my todo 
list is finalising the npcs, adding space stations and finally sorting 
the galactic map out. There will be LOADS to explore and alien races to 
trade with just like in star flight 2000. Galaxy wise it will be smaller
 but will have MUCH more going on than in sf2000, it will also finally 
have the back story in there as well.<br><br>more soon... <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>more done</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2014-03-25)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Getting there<br><img src="26&amp;log=1882_files/sr1.html"><br><br>And <br><img src="26&amp;log=1882_files/sr2.html"><br><br>Yes this is made with monkey and it works on me Nexus 7 :) <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>early pic</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2013-11-05)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> here's a wip pic of the generation system<br><img src="26&amp;log=1882_files/monkeysr1.html"><br><br>there is three suns in the system this is why the planets are lit the way they are, this code is monkey and minib3d <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>trials and tribulations</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2013-10-28)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Well after spending the best part of a week looking at the code, how it
 works and why i have hit a wall. Monkey with minib3d doesn't lend well 
to procedural generation due to issues with mesh creation etc. Currently
 i can create one planet etc but they ALL have to be created before the 
game starts which doesn't lend to generating at random intervals in the 
game.<br><br>to this end i will look elsewhere to complete this 
particular project as i don't want to continue to fight with the 
generator etc. I might go back to 2d monkey or once again look to other 
systems. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>first entry again ;)</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2013-10-21)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Well i have finally got around to doing the whole project in monkey 
using minib3d, on the whole its looking quite nice at the moment but i 
want the whole star system complete before jumping for joy.<br><br>on 
the whole porting from blitzmax to monkey is easy bit porting from 
dbclassic to monkey is a little harder but still doable once its upto 
speed i will complete the whole project finally.<br><br>once the star system generator is complete i will release a tech demo so everyone can see it in action :) <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
