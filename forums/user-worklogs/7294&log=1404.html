 don't think i'll even be attempting to make it real time. Bmax just 
isn't fast enough or my coding skills just aren't good enough. I prefer 
the former though suspect it's the latter :)<br><br>So it'll mostly be for a really cool screenshot system...<br><br>I.e
 Rasterized pixel shaded 3d for in game. when the player hits "Take a 
screenshot" it renders a glorious 1024x1024 hi-def render of your game 
with immaculate per pixel lighting, ray traced shadows, ray traced 
texturing, and i'm even toying with the idea of writing a little pixel 
shader language using what i've learnt doing code-monkey.<br><br>So minib3d xe could very well end up with a renderman like quality to it...<br><br>All
 big ifs, I'm still not entirely sure I want to continue developing the 
blitzmax version. or any version. I just don't see the potential for 
earning anything(With the C++ version) and I'm not allowed to sell 
anything on the blitz boards..<br><br>Maybe if I were and could afford a fulltime hobby(which cfoding a 3d engine is trust me)...<br><br>but
 who knows..everytime i play half life 2 that feeling that only writing a
 3d engine can invoke tingles down my spine and i'm back trying some new
 fx or something...<br><br>So never say never. Either way, people are 
already porting my additions to the google version, so I guess I've made
 a contributation even i I do call it quits here.<br><br><br>Wow an whole post without one silly joke...what the hell is going on!! <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Video Pleasent</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-12-01)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> <img src="7294&amp;log=1404_files/shot1jpg.jpg"><br><br><img src="7294&amp;log=1404_files/shot2jpg.jpg"><br><br>and a 3 minute video i captured of it running on my killer new laptop :) <br><br>(13mb - Requires DivX Codec to play)<br><a href="http://www.amonuk.com/antony/Demo1-TheVideo.avi" target="_blank">http://www.amonuk.com/antony/Demo1-TheVideo.avi</a> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Gaberial Number One</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-12-01)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Support is mounting. But we've become so powerful that now we are

his free will.<br><br>We've found a skilfful lawyer who has been able to

 I've just released version 1.0 and 1.1 is being uploaded as I type. 
(Why do people say as we speak when A) they're not talking to anyone and
 B) they're not bloody speaking?)<br><br>Basically it's minib3d rewrote nearly from the ground up in places and added with a sprinke of next gen fairy dust.<br><br>The effect i'm most proud of is the depth of field. in just TWO lines of code you get solid 3d depth of field.<br>The
 only thing i dislike about is the lack of fine grane control over it. 
Like being able to set to blur a specific region of 3d space.<br>But that can always be added in a future revision<br><br><br>The
 thing I want to stress MOST about this engine is, it should be viewed 
as a community engine. Now I know thats only going to happen if the 
community actually use it, but it doesn't hurt to dream big.  <br><br>So
 give it a try, try a few of the fx out, write a few shaders, and if you
 do anything cool you'd like to share, e-mail me the updated code(Please
 comment where and what you've changed so i can integrate it. ) at
