 Yes, it's that time of year again. Summer is coming, and I've come up 
with more ideas. Following past form, I'll likely do all the hard parts 
and then stop once things get boring in the programming department.<br><br>Nevertheless,
 for the time being, I'm working on a specifically co-operative First 
Person Shooter. I know what you're thinking: give a monkey a game 
development language, and he'll write a poor FPS. Which is why I've 
always steered clear of them. The amateur scene is full of examples of 
why not to even try.<br><br>I've always known that I don't know what 
really makes a good FPS, and that I could never match up to the best 
examples. It's a crowded genre, and you have to be at the top of your 
game with a big team behind you to produce something worth the time.<br><br>Co-operative
 games, on the other hand, are a little less regular. Having played an 
awful lot of Terrorist Hunt on Rainbow Six: Vegas, I've gotten a great 
feel for what I enjoy about that game, and what I don't.<br><br>So, I've
 been thinking of ways to enhance that sort of gameplay, such as mixing 
up the roles a little more. Maybe one player is in a surveillance drone,
 and can spot for other players. Or there's more of a commander role 
such as in Battlefield 2.<br><br>My thinking is that multiplayer games 
are fun, but there are advantages to single player games. In single 
player, I am enjoying an experience that has been carefully crafted from
 start to finished. In multiplayer, my enjoyment is entirely at the whim
 of the legions of players who are better than me, but it's a more 
social experience.<br><br>Co-operative play has the best qualities of 
both multi- and single- player. It's social, but myself and a group of 
friends can play through at our own pace, talking and kidding around at 
the same time we shout instructions at each other. If we lose, we lose 
together, and try again together.<br><br>This time, I have an artist 
working on the 3d models for me, so hopefully this project will be more 
of a team effort. In the meantime, I've got a simple multiplayer TCP 
environment working, and right now I'm working on switching over some of
 that to UDP, and making it a little lest host-centric. I hope to bring 
screenshots to the party next time.<br><br>Till then.<br><br>Seeya, folks! <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
