 After a short break from coding my attention has turned towards 
building the rest of Cell Block A. I've released a couple of new 
screenshots that show the more complete corridor outside the first cell.
 Weapon yielding is working well and I've textured the basic broom stick
 handle, still trying to get the player model look better and I hope to 
scan some fabrics in for the texturing soon<br><br><img src="1721&amp;log=1129_files/asylum04.html"><br> <br><br> Paul Huckstepp - AlternativeRealities<br><a href="http://www.alternativerealities.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.alternativerealities.co.uk</a><br><a href="http://www.argames.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.argames.co.uk</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Asylum - Weapon Yielding Part2</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2002-08-05)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Hurray, Weapon yielding is in, following some queries on the forums I 
sorted out the parenting issues with the weapon. I didnt realise that 
when an object is parented to a child object in a 3ds mesh it inherits a
 0,0,0 coordinate from the object, i.e. not a world coordinate. Once I 
realised that I could finally snap the object to the right hand. Next 
step is the animations for the attacks (melee and ranged) as well as the
 construction of the first floor.<br> <br><br> Paul Huckstepp - AlternativeRealities<br><a href="http://www.alternativerealities.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.alternativerealities.co.uk</a><br><a href="http://www.argames.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.argames.co.uk</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Asylum - Weapon yeilding</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2002-07-28)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 For the last few weekends I've been attempting to yield weapons (in the
 game that is) unfortunately I'm having a few difficulties with 
parenting the weapon to the right hand, for some unknown reason it 
doesnt want to know. I've coded a temporary work around but its not 100%
 perfect.<br><br>In the meantime, heres a screenshot showing the Anxiety Engine with an paranoia rating of about 40%<br><br><img src="1721&amp;log=1129_files/asylum02.html"><br> <br><br> Paul Huckstepp - AlternativeRealities<br><a href="http://www.alternativerealities.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.alternativerealities.co.uk</a><br><a href="http://www.argames.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.argames.co.uk</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Asylum</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2002-07-15)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 For the last few weeks I have been concentrating on furthering the 
research into texture mapping and lightmapping for the game environment 
and was as putting together the functionality for the inventory panel.<br><br>As
 it stands at the moment the game engine now allows usable objects to be
 picked up and dropped. When an object in the inventory is clicked a 
brief description of the object now appears in the bottom section of the
 display. I have also added visual cues on screen for objects that are 
in range and can be picked up. Objects outside of this range will 
display there tags in red, objects within range that can be picked up 
appear in white.<br><br>I am very pleased with the way the inventory is 
working at the moment and hope to add the use and journal functionality 
soon, however the journal isn't a vital component of the game just yet.<br><br>The
 anxiety engine is now complete. There was a small bug that was fixed 
this week; if the anxiety level was at 80% and the player then moved 
immediately in to a safe zone the fogging effects would get stuck 
leaving the player in darkness.<br><br>So whats next, the next stages 
for me is to try my hand at the lightmapping, I hope to be able to use 
lightmapping to improve the appearance of the asylum, and add depth by 
casting shadows, also, I'm about to try to implement the yielding of 
weapons.<br> <br><br> Paul Huckstepp - AlternativeRealities<br><a href="http://www.alternativerealities.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.alternativerealities.co.uk</a><br><a href="http://www.argames.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.argames.co.uk</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Asylum</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2002-07-10)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Seeing as Asylum is my second Blitz3d game I thought I'd add a worklog to the Blitz website.<br><br>Screenshots available : www.argames.co.uk<br><br>ASYLUM DEVELOPMENT UPDATE - 19/05/2002<br>Asylum is still going strong, after another successfully few weeks I have completed some of the troubling collision code. <br><br>I
 have now worked out a system to transfer elements from the main level 
scene and export those out seperately, this is for doors, lights and any
 object that can be moved or pickedup. <br><br>Although it doesn't sound
 very exciting, I have managed to get my first door working, doors have 
always been a bit fiddly and my first attempt left the door constantly 
swinging round and round, however I have now finished the animations 
engine and I now have a door that opens correctly and then closes when 
the player is far enough away from it. I'm extremely pleased with the 
final result. <br><br>Ok, so whats next; My next task is to create an 
exporter for the level area and the elements so that its more automatic.
 Also, I'm about to start working on the cut-scene engine, this will 
allow me to get the openning sequence started and will help move the 
story along during the game. <br><br>Thats all for now, I was hoping to 
get a screenshot together for this issue but sadly the game hasn't 
progressed visually enough for that.<br><br>Main coding complete on FPS - 04/06/2002<br>Over
 the last few weeks I have been concentrating on a number of aspects 
regarding the development of Asylum, these have been: Texturing 
solution: to make life easier when it comes to texturing the many 
objects in the game, I'm currently investigating texturetools.com Tru-V 
r2 3D Exporter: I have successfully created an export system to allow me
 to create level structures directly within the 3d modeller, this will 
allow all the data require for Blitz to be stored within the 3d model 
itself and then split into the various data files when needed. FPS Code:
 The FPS is now practically complete, I will add new features when they 
are needed, the major change in this version is the inertia, it has now 
been brought down to a much more playable speed. And I can also say that
 looking down in Asylum does reveal your feet!<br><br>First major coding session - 06/05/2002<br>Asylum
 development is back. This last week has been very productive, I've 
penned some new ideas for atmospherics and I have also begun to code the
 FPS engine for Asylum.<br><br>The FPS side currently has a fully 
working mouselook, character animation, collision detection, up-and-down
 slopes and stairs, and Jumping. The jump sequence was particularly 
complex because of the multiple heights that the player can assume, ie 
jumping from a flight of stairs means that you have further to fall. In 
the end I calculated the Y Axis Normal of the scenery collision 
detection, this can only every be pointing at an angle of more than 0 
and so must be the floor, it worked fantastically.<br><br>The next step 
is to get crouch working and then the Right-Click inventory. I am also 
actively working on the texture maps for the characters, if any one 
knows of a good texture mapping web site please let me know.<br><br>ASYLUM Main Site : www.argames.co.uk<br> <br><br> Paul Huckstepp - AlternativeRealities<br><a href="http://www.alternativerealities.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.alternativerealities.co.uk</a><br><a href="http://www.argames.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.argames.co.uk</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
