 title says it all really, this project is sitll on hold. my hours have 
reduced somewhat, im now working 9:30-6ish insetad of 6-6ish so my

 waiting for the 6-2 guy to do the late shift so i can have the rest of 
the day to myself, thats when i get more time to read/understand blitz

icicle works dream based on a level that i was having dificulties with

level on the fly and turned the polar bear into a present and finally 
got off the level.<br><br>seeing as ive not touched this for some time

 after filling in some survey to find the missing line in the download

 with these trainers enabled im still dying stupidly due to my growing 
up with qaop and this using aspl and reconfiging it to the cursor 
resulted in it crashing somewhat (perhaps i should try heracy and select
 wsad?)<br><br>but i managed to complete a few levels that were giving 
me grief on the plus4 version (looks kinda the same but sounds worse, i 
thought the SID rocked, cos thats what everyone seems to say, speccy 
owner myself) and ive found myself stuck with infinate lives on two hard
 levels that i remember and remember beating (or watching my brother do 
so i forget), one a spiral with alot of feral polar bears hunting around
 and the odd present generating penguin, the other which i almost 
completed had alot of death snow to contend with as well as too many 
polar bears trapped in a single square, how the hell you are meant to 
survive level 16 is beyond me<br>i think ill turn time back off and just
 try with the infinate lives cos the spiral level only gives you 90 
seconds to complete it and im sure it takes me longer when i dont have

 if ive counted it right there are only 16 levels to the plus4 version, 
could have sworn it was 20, unless i was reading bout the C64 version,

squeeze an extra 4 levels i guess ... once i find a c64 version that

 i got a very basic hex editor and found out 8 was the boarder wall by

</pre><br>but as they were 38 wide that meant they over shot the hex editors 32 per line limit<br><br>at
 first i couldnt tell if the first chunk i stumbled upon was the first 
level or not, the second line looked nothing like my hand drawn map or 
anything else so was it the first the last or even flipped/flopped to 
make hex editing the levels on the plus 4 that little bit harder?<br><br>what
 i wanted to do was just have the level chunk copied out into a new file
 so i could have a quick gander at it, but the hex editer i had didnt 
want to know about it so i tried another, again no joy i tried dragging 
along the text and an alert to the demo version being used scuppered 
those plans<br><br>so i just went to the top of the level data and wrote
 delete this gumph!!! so in note pad when i saw that i knew to delete 
all that was before it<br>this gave me something cleaner to work with 
but i would still liked to have been able to save the hex values as 
ascii so if it said<br><pre class="code">881FB985AA54FF53

 can probably read this in blitz and output what i want, but i wanted 
something kinda quick to work with so i could find out what was what

 paint, pretending that each colour would act as a specific tile much

screen grabs of most of the first level to get some idea of the level

 the whole level as one "giant" image but i missed of bits here and

 One Christmas Eve many many years ago Santa totally ripped off 
BoulderDash for commodor's short lived plus4 in a game called icicle 
works (it might have come out for the c64 but i never had one so i dont 
know) iir it came bundled with the computer along with god knows how 
many other cassette games and iir we never bought other games for it, it
 was bought for the bussiness apps by my dad but he could never get me 
or my brother off it with icicle works and treasure island taking up the
 lions share of tape wear and tear<br><br>then as they all seemed to the
 plus4 died a death (but we still kept it and afaik still have it) and 
we had long since migrated to the ST/Amiga (the amiga was my brothers) 
and i had gotten STOS for my birthday (which i never got into mostly due
 to the fact it was still numbered like the speccy was) and i wanted to 
remake icicle works as best as i could remember it (the machine long 
since dead so i had no levels to compare with) and my gfx skills sucked 
big time (i think im now worse at pixel 'art') so it wouldnt be icicle 
works as i rememberd just a game with a santa theme and i had found a 
fair few better boulderdash games by this time and shelved it as a "why
