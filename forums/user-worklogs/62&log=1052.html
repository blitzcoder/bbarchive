Time for a quick progress update on my remake of RDS.<br><br>I've
 been busy working on the menu system for several weeks now. Instead of 
using simple 2d menus (like I did in my Bruce Lee remake) I opted for a 
fully 3d approach. All of the menu items displayed are 3d objects 
(quads, cubes, spheres, etc.) so I can use all the lovely alpha 
transparency effects like fading options in and out. This has meant that
 it's taking much longer than usual to code the different options 
screens required, but it'll be worth it in the end.<br><br>I'm just 
about to start work on the vehicle selection screen. Once that is done I
 can leave the menu system for now (only a couple of disabled options 
are left to do) so I can get back to work on the game engine again.<br><br>I'm
 intending to rip out the physics and car control code I'm currently 
using and start from scratch. I bought a nice (and in-depth) game 
physics development book a few weeks ago so that should hopefully give 
me what I need to make the cars crashing and bouncing around like crazy 
:). This phsyics and control code is the most important as far as I am 
concerned as I want the game to play similar to the original, enhancing 
it where I can.<br><br>I've added some pictures to show you some of the latest screenshots added to my website.<br><br>To view more screenshots and be kept more up to date on my progress, go the my RDS remake website here:<br><a href="http://www.planetflibble.com/rds" target="_blank">http://www.planetflibble.com/rds</a><br><br>Regards,<br>Mark<br><br>- The track selection screen with the playlist controls visible<br><img src="62&amp;log=1052_files/screen22.html"><br><br>- The track selection screen with the 3d track preview visible<br><img src="62&amp;log=1052_files/screen21.html"><br><br>- A more up to date screenshot of the track designer in action<br><img src="62&amp;log=1052_files/screen23.html"><br> <br><br> <a href="http://blitz.planetflibble.com/" target="_blank">Bruce Lee - a remake for the PC (finished)</a><br><a href="http://rds.planetflibble.com/" target="_blank">Racing Destruction Set - a remake for the PC (work in progress)</a><br><img src="62&amp;log=1052_files/tiny1.html">  <img src="62&amp;log=1052_files/tiny2.html">  <img src="62&amp;log=1052_files/tiny3.html">  <img src="62&amp;log=1052_files/tiny4.html"> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Racing Destruction Set - progress @ 5th July 2002</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2002-07-06)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Just a brief progress update on my Racing Destruction Set remake... <br><br>First, a couple of screenshots:<br><br>- Both player cars finishing a jump<br><img src="62&amp;log=1052_files/screen15.html"><br><br>- a shot of the Track Designer<br><img src="62&amp;log=1052_files/screen17.html"><br><br>Coding
 has been going on now, slowly but surely, for 2 months now. I'm pretty 
happy with my progress so far mainly as I don't get as much time as I'd 
like to work on this (Real Life (tm) including working full time get in 
the way ). <br><br><br>What's done: <br><br>Track Designer.<br>---------------<br>I'm
 very happy with the designer. It has the same feel of the original but 
with some more added functionality to make life easier. The track 
validation is much better and it tells you exactly what type of problem 
there might be as well as showing you where the problem lies. The track 
piece display in 3d works well and I've just added a 3d preview to show 
the full track, allbeit from above view at the moment. <br><br>Basic vehicle movement and collisions. <br>--------------------------------------<br>Both
 player cars move around the track, jumping with gravity and without 
falling off the track. The track has a hidden collision wall all around 
the designed track which stops the player from leaving the track. The 
basic collision between player and track and hidden walls works well, so
 far. <br><br>Simulated 'track lanes' (or slots).<br>-----------------------------------<br>I
 am using a hidden waypoint system which is calcuated for the track 
depending on which way around the track the players can go. Each track 
piece's waypoints are divided into 3 'lanes' allowing me to work out the
 closest waypoint to the player and the closest waypoint in front of the
 player. I use this information to subtly 'steer' the player toward the 
closest lane. How much this steers needs tweaking but the basic system 
works nicely. <br><br>That's about it for now. If you want up-to-date
