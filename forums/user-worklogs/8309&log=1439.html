 first I have to say that I'm quite ready with porting all previous 
extensions to the new minib3d 0.45 Version (thx to simonh for the great 
work). But secondly I have to say that I have to go a bit deeper in 
minib3d to get everything working properly. This means a bit more 
developing time but I think a much prettier design. The first big 
difference to the previous extended Version is the Shadersystem. 
Originally integrated in the Brush system it is now completely 
independent. Currently I have 2 new Types one called TShaderMaterial as 
the parent Type of TGLSLMaterial and later on TCGMaterial. This is in my
 opinion a much cleaner way to integrate shaders. <br><br>This is a small sample about an early Shaderintegration:<br><pre class="code">Local Material:TShaderMaterial = TShaderMaterial.CreateShaderMaterial("Bump") 
Material.AddShader("bump.vert","bump.frag") 
Material.AddSampler2D("colorMap", 0, Tex[0] ) 
Material.AddSampler2D("normalMap", 1, Tex[1] )
</pre><br><br>Now some more additions:<br><br>Well take a look at this texture :<br><img src="8309&amp;log=1439_files/rtt2048x2048.webp"><br><br>Well
 nothing fancy you may think, but what If I say that it represents 
render to texture and the importent part : offscreen. That means the 
cube texture has a resolution of 2048*2048.<br><br>Well, this is done by
 integrating a new Type called TTextureBuffer based on FBOs (Framebuffer
 Objects). With this technique I was able to get rid of the ATI bug 
which makes glCopyTexImage2D damn slow if you copy the depthbuffer. With
 FBOs I was able to implement a not ready but an early version of 
Shadowmapping. Currently it is a bit buggy but I hope this will change 
when I have cleaned up and changed the Render routines. <br><br><img src="8309&amp;log=1439_files/ShadowMapTest.webp"><br><br>Well, not much news but at least a bit of progress. <br><br>Bye till next worklog. <br><br> <a href="http://www.brsoftware.de.vu/" target="_blank">http://www.brsoftware.de.vu</a><br>Console Module Current Version 1.4 with animated Image support and dividable Output and customizable commands<br><img src="8309&amp;log=1439_files/Console2005-05-3022-51-24-21thumb.webp"><br><a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=49549" target="_blank">http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=49549</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>finally some more NEWS</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2007-10-23)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 At first I have to say sorry for the big delay with miniB3D extended. 
But unfortunatly I don't have that much time currently due to other 
stuff I have to do.<br><br>Don't fear : the extended Version will be continued and I'm still working on it.<br><br>So some news about the next release:<br><br>1. incbin files (Meshes/Textures) are fully implemented. <br>Even textured meshes could be stored completely in the executable with some restrictions.<br>(texture files have to be incbined in the root without any path)<br><br>2. Fullscreen and perEntity FX System: <br>The Fullscreen FXs are already working, the perEntity <br>FX are working but not completely.<br><br>3. TextureBuffers through FBO (A seperate Version for <br>Images in plain Max2D is planned)<br><br>4. A TerrainLayersystem: <br>Some kind of foliage management system I'm currently <br>working on.<br><br>5. Last new thing will be a new Type I will introduce: TMaterial<br>This
 Type is an more advanced Brushtype espacially designed to be more

 Well, after releasing the beta of '0.41 extended' I have taken a small 
break from developing on it to get the head a bit clean. <br>You know , sometimes you get stuck and you don't find any solution but after a small break everything goes easier.<br>So, while taking the break some small ideas about minib3d were spreading in my brain.<br><br>1.
 Idea: one of the most time consuming functions in minib3d is the 
frustum handling. Well it works, but it is currently a pain to add a lot
 of entitys (more than 5000) at startup. and after that minib3d updates 
and calculates the ifrustum for every single step. <br>So, how to speed 
this up. Well today I have taken out the 'renderlist creation part' out 
of the RenderCamera Function and introduced a new type call 
TSceneManager. In fact currently it is nothing more than an abstract 
type of the old render list creation but now it could be easily extended
 and exchanged by eg octree rendering or other culling mechanism. A 
first experiment with a new scenemanager which has divided the maximum 
area into 16 boxes gives already a good speed hit (sorry no exact 
figures yet).<br><br>2. Idea: the introduction of an additional 
TScenemanager extension. Well, exactly I mean some easy and extandable 
LOD System. In my idea I was thinking about a system based on 'grid 
layers' or 'box layers'. Each layer could have different method to 
handle LOD (eg Alphafading, render an amount of entites related to the 
distance etc.). In the code you may have to do something like:<br><br>Local LODLayer:TLODLayer = CreateLODLayer(parts,LAYER_ALPHA,STEPS)<br><br>And after that you could assign entities like this:<br>EntityLODLayer(Entity,LODLAyer)<br><br>The update of each LOD will be handled within the engine and can be extended by callbacks.<br><br>But first I will finish the beta ;) <br><br>As you see, a lot to do. <br><br> <a href="http://www.brsoftware.de.vu/" target="_blank">http://www.brsoftware.de.vu</a><br>Console Module Current Version 1.4 with animated Image support and dividable Output and customizable commands<br><img src="8309&amp;log=1439_files/Console2005-05-3022-51-24-21thumb.webp"><br><a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=49549" target="_blank">http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=49549</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Some light at the horizon</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2007-04-06)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Update:<br><br>-VBO
 system has changed and it now needs to be turned on for each mesh 
seperately. This is because VBO's are only useful for static and tris 
heavy objects.<br><br>-A currently non LOD based terrain (which is designed to add LOD later) is also done. (will run fast with VBOs)<br><br>Some updates relating to the Particle system:<br><br>first screen of my current Editor build:<br><img src="8309&amp;log=1439_files/pedit.webp"><br><br>-Single Surface or Entity based Emitters<br>-Due
 to the fact that miniB3D is a bit slower in single surface 
handling(maybe an OpenGL driver issue) I'm currently working on new 
Entity Type called TFastSprite. These sprites will use the OpenGL 
internal Point_Sprite extension which only needs 1 point of th sprite 
(mid point) and then it will calculate the correct translation and 
orientation to the Cam <br>on the GPU. This trick is used by mainly all 
Particle Engines I could find. And those could handle a massive amount 
of particles on screen.<br><br>You see : progress is coming slowly but it comes.<br><br>PS: <br>I have also added 2 new Functions to miniB3D which are very useful in my opinion.<br>1. CanvasGraphics3D(Canvas:TGadget)<br>Prepares a canvas and miniB3D to work together without hacking with the SetGraphicsDirver stuff in your main code like before.<br>2.

 hi folks, this is my first worklog. The reason for this is that my 
release of the minib3d extended Version is delayed due to lack of time 
:(.<br>Well, this dosn't mean I won't work on it anymore. In fact I'm <br>working on different things regarding minib3d. <br><br>to give you a small sign whats going on:<br>- VBO Support has changed. <br>  You now have to enable it for the mesh you want to have VBO.<br>
  I have done this because after playing around with it I've come to the
 conclusion that it only is really valuable when used with highpoly and 
(mainly)static objects.<br><br>- Physics works already.<br>  A lot of things needed to be added but the main engine stays.<br><br>- A single Surface Particle Engine also already exist.<br>  At least the Framework (for simple emitters it already works)<br><br>-
 Shadows. They work but are a bit slow for animated characters. ZFail 
and ZPass are already included. Maybe I will add Projected ShadowMaps 
after I'm ready with everything else.<br><br>- All the bugfixes and additions from minib3d 0.41 are build in (as far as I could recognize them)<br><br>Also I'm working on a Demo with Physics and a charackter controller.<br><br>Next week we have Easter holidays in Germany and I hope i will get ready for an initila release.<br><br>See ya. <br><br> <a href="http://www.brsoftware.de.vu/" target="_blank">http://www.brsoftware.de.vu</a><br>Console Module Current Version 1.4 with animated Image support and dividable Output and customizable commands<br><img src="8309&amp;log=1439_files/Console2005-05-3022-51-24-21thumb.webp"><br><a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=49549" target="_blank">http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=49549</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
