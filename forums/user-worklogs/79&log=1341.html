 Sorry about the lack of updates lately - work has been flat out and 
have been doing many late nights and weekends due to lack of team mates.
  Anyway, the end is nigh (thankfully!) and will be bringing a new 
update out in the next couple of weeks.  I do have a fairly large update
 essentially ready to go with many fixes:<br><br>* Updated the usersettings to include storing the main window status ie. Position, WindowState etc<br>* Fixed an exception where a temporary project has been compiled/run and is saved to it's selected location<br>*
 Fixed a quite strange issue where if the startup page was shown and you
 created a solution or new item, the startup document in the project 
would not stay activated<br>* Fixed an issue highlighting certain compilation errors within the editor<br>* Fixed an issue identifying if a token has parameters on the very first line/word - Blitz3d/Basic plugin<br>* Fixed a long standing issue with the tabbed document lists due to not properly assigning a new Guid to the window :)<br>* Fixed spelling of Compile Output items - Blitz3d/Basic plugin<br>* Fixed an issue raising multile builds via pressing the F5 key a number of times (Thanks GFK)<br>* Fixed ongoing issues with shortcut keys (eg. F5 and CTRL+S) not always working<br>* Fixed an issue with the Import Project wizard where a default solution configuration was not selected<br>* Fixed a couple of issues in the compilation routine<br>* Updated to latest release of Actipro SyntaxEditor v4.0.0274<br>* Updated the Project Studio application stucture for more program types<br>* Updated the New Solution process to use a Guid for the internal folder structure<br>* Added a Start Page button to the Standard menu<br>* Centralised all generic program settings to easily customise the application framework for more program types<br><br>Have a couple more to add from recent reports (thanks Michael!) so once this is done I'll get a new release out.<br><br>Sorry also to those people looking for the Pro version - the Blitz3d release will be coming very shortly.<br><br>Live Mesh<br>---------<br>If
 you haven't heard about this new service from Microsoft - check it out 
(still in beta - you can apply throught Connect).  Essentially it 
provides a central repository for files which you can add a number of 
sources to access it to/from.  I've been using it as a on-line project 
repository for all my source code.  Work offline on the train, get into 
the office, go on-line and it syncs up automatically - great!  Once you 
sync up all other PCs linking to the repository will be updated as well.

 up I’m currently making some changes, enhancements and fixes to Project
 Studio that will be rolled-up into a release (Express version) in the 
next few weeks.<br><br>On the BlitzMax plug-in side of things, I’m still
 not that happy. I feel it will require some rework to get it to a level
 I believe it suitable for general use. The current implementation is 
quite complex and slow when dealing with the possible 15,000 to 20,000+ 
keywords. I’m going to investigate using LINQ to assist me to filter the
 keyword structure down to find items I require. I’ve been playing with 
it on another project I’m working on, and it’s quite amazing to be 
honest. I haven’t got a timeframe on this, but the current 
implementation will always be available with the Express version.<br><br>With
 that in mind the Professional version will be released soon for

 Well my aim of getting the Prefessional version out before Christmas is
 unfortunately not going to happen.  I really want to make sure the 
intellisense works as close to perfection before anyone puts in their 
hard-earned, so onwards we go.<br><br>That doesn't mean we are still not
 close.  The next release will infact be pretty close to finished.  I've
 been working on getting extended type feeding up the chain - was 
suprised my current implementation was a little way off where I thought 
it was.  Anyway, appears to be very solid now.  The one area I'll need 
further work is on the tooltips - extended types just don't work as yet.<br><br>I
 will get another version out before christmas for the people taking

 Ok, have gone through and basically finalised the BlitzMax Express 
version.  This will work in the same manner as the Blitz3d/Basic version
 in that you have your open files within the editor and compile the 
active file (just like the BlitzIDE).<br><br>The one added bonus I have 
included is that the intellisense will now also take into consideration 
all open files (for the language of the active file) rather than just 
the one currently active, giving you much better coverage of your files.
  It won't be as flexible as the Professional version which pulls 
intellisense info from closed files, but it will provide a pretty good 
development experience.<br><br>By the way, I've also updated the Blitz3d/Basic plugin to match!  Look for a release in the next day or so!<br><br>For
 those looking for the Professional version, just a another week or so 
to go.  Remember, this version has the full project management 
functionality as well as other features such as tasks lists and user 
defined comment lists! <br><br> Regards,<br><br>Matt<br><br>Pentium4 2.4gHz, 2GB PC2700 Ram, 128MB ATI Raedeon 9600SE, Windows XP 32bit,<br>Dell Inspiron 6400 Laptop, T7200 2.00GHz Dual Core, 2GB Ram, GeForce 7300 Go, Windows Seven 64bit </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>In the home straight....</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2007-11-11)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">

 Just released a new beta to the testers - hopefully will get a good 
response and not too many issues.  The whole intellisense stuff has been
 rejigged as outlined in previous worklogs.<br><br>The number of 
intellisense items is now controlled by the user with a number turned 
off by default.  Infact, a couple of mods take up more than half the 
intellisense items, so it is quite managable with those turned off (or a
 user-selected mix).  Have also setup an internal list to store the 
first pass validation of the main list, so that has helped speed up the 
use - works quite well me thinks!<br><br>We'll see what feedback comes 
back, but it may not be too far away from a full release! hooray!!  Been

 Well my continuing efforts to intellisense the entire BlitzMax language
 has met with some interesting results.  Just the BRL and PUB modules 
alone contain something like 13,000 items!<br><br>This is probably a 
little more than I would have expected, so speed is definitely going to 
be an issue with that amount of items (especially once you add other 
mods).  It still is pretty quick with the intellisense, but there is a 
little delay now.  I may need to look at storing the items a little 
differently....<br><br>I might also offer an alternative - access the 
currently documented items (as per the BlitzMax IDE) or access the

 The development is coming along - not spent much time as yet on tidying
 up more of the BlitzMax intellisense as I’m waiting for my holidays to 
start once my wife gives birth.<br><br>I’ve have been working on 
finalising the Code Snippets though. The snippets manager is now 
complete so you can see the snippet structure plus view and edit the 
snippets themselves in the IDE (snippets can be grouped in sections and 
sub-sections). Also formalised the user folder for them so you can add 
your own now via your program folder area in MyDocuments (or Documents 
in Vista).<br><br>Have also added a new intellisense dialog in the 
Options for BlitzMax that allows you to select the main mods you wish to

 Have started working on gathering full information from all BlitzMax 
mods for the intellisense.  I've currently implemented the commands.txt 
list, but this does not provide me with all the relationshsips between 
keywords.<br><br>I've converted the DocMods module into .Net which is 
working fine, but now that i've got a proper understanding of how this 
works there is the issue of documented keywords.  I would like to 
include all required keywords including Consts, Globals etc to ensure 
full intellisense, but as they are currently not documented, this method
 will not provide all relevant info (only items with Rem ... End Rem are
 documented - which is a good system as you don't need to know public

 Well - the last couple of days have been very productive.  All 
functionality is in and working for Blitz3d/Basic, just needs a tidy up 
and polish. <br><br>I have also added Code Snippets (just need to work

 Well, the syntax editor control from Actipro is awesome!  Can't believe
 how much I've been able to accomplish - stuff like Member Lists, 
Parameter Info, Quick Info and Word Completion are all in the 
Blitz3d/Basic language plugin. I still need to do more work on 
identifying some of the keywords correctly, but the majority is working 
great and I'm very happy with the speed.<br><br>Loading projects/files

first step is the automated tooltips when hovering over items like

 is great (must admit not seen the sort of problems [yet???] that Ziggy 
has with his editor) and once I get the parsing of these done correctly,

 Making slow progress with the syntax editor. I'm still finding the

 Finally getting there!  I've decided to freeze the development at this 
time so I can get some feedback from the testers.  It's been a long time
 coming (in fact much longer than I anticipated, with more work still to
 be completed) but I've reached a point where the product is quite 
usable to the point I can get some decent feedback.  Therefore the 
testers will be able to have a look in the next couple of days.<br><br>I'm
 certainly looking forward to getting some feedback on the product as it
 stands and hopefully some further ideas to enhance the program.<br><br>- Solution Explorer -<br>This
 has really come together the last week or so as I've added all 
functionality found within VS2005 (except drag-drop and cut/copy/paste).
  This will give the user much flexability as they can Load/Reload 
projects, show all files within the structure of the project (not just 
the ones within the project, but any folder or file!!!) and easily 
include any file simply using a popup menu - I've quite pleased with 
this I'll tell ya!!<br><br>- Options - <br>Added more dialogs to the 
Options function - it's really starting to fill out now - still have a 
bit of work to get everything in, but it's quite easy to add a new page 
and settings to the plugins.<br><br>- Finally - <br>Tidying up a couple 
of final things in the product and just getting my server re-installed 
at the moment in preparation - should be an exciting week or so coming 
up... <br><br> Regards,<br><br>Matt<br><br>Pentium4 2.4gHz, 2GB PC2700 Ram, 128MB ATI Raedeon 9600SE, Windows XP 32bit,<br>Dell Inspiron 6400 Laptop, T7200 2.00GHz Dual Core, 2GB Ram, GeForce 7300 Go, Windows Seven 64bit </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Getting There....</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-03-28)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Can't believe how time flies...<br><br>Finished
 off the Solution Explorer (well almost all, not the copy/paste as yet 
though) and began some testing of this area along with the New Project 
stuff (it all sort of ties back).  Found a few issues that made me go 
back and streamline the process a little further - it all seems to be 
working pretty well now.<br><br>- More Testing - <br>I really wanted to 
take a bit of a break and decided to do some 'user' testing - it was a 
good chance to do some end-to-end testing which I hadn't done as yet.  
Found a couple issues and thought I might as well go through some of the
 other major parts of the program - ended up tiding the Compiler, 
Debugger, the menus and toolbars functions.  It's really helped get the 
program to a very usable point now.<br><br>- Options - <br>Next up is 
the Options dialog. This needs to allow me to grab stuff from each the 
plugins, so back into the XML templates.  Got the basic stuff going now:
 Build the tree (attaching the associated 'option' dialog) and when you 
select an option it copies into a panel.  <br><br>All I need to do is 
initialise the plugins (this loads each of the options), build the tree 
and dispose when closing (saves the options).  It all ties back nicely 
into each dialog (a user control) so it's easy to update and maintain.  
Woohoo!<br><br>- Coming Up -<br>I'm currently behind schedule due to my 
cricket finals, some holidays and work - all have taken considerable

 still working on the Solution Explorer module - not too far to go now 
thank goodness!  I've re-added much of the editing functionality: 
delete, remove, create folders, add existing items etc.  This had the 
added benefit of tidying up the code for creating the tree structure.  I
 only really have the Add New Items dialog left to do - which much like 
the New Project stuff, relies on XML templates.  Also re-hooked in the 
Properties dialog as well - you can now edit/rename files/folders and 
other properties either via the Explorer tree itself or in the 
properties. <br><br>I'm starting to get real close to completing this area, which means the beta won't be too far away.<br><br>- Solution Explorer -<br>One
 area I still need to complete is the cut/copy/paste from within the 
Solution Explorer tree.  I don't see a real issue doing the work as I 
think I've got my head around all the issues, but it could turn out to 
be fairly tricky.  I'll keep you posted!<br><br>- Grid Wars -<br>As 
usual Mark Incitti has created an awesome game that shows off what can 
be done in BlitzMax.  He has always produced well developed games and is
 always willing to share his code (which I'm setting aside to check 
out!).  All the best towards the completion of this project.   Note: I 
also noticed you have started recoding Marble Insanity in BlitzMax - 
can't wait till this finally sees the light of day!<br><br>Also great to
 see the Aussies back kicking arse in the Cricket and doing it the way

 Been a pretty productive couple of days.  Brought over a fair chunck of
 the Solution Explorer Tree code and associated Properties item mapping 
(not that there is a lot to do here as it's all part of each item's 
property validation within the object's class).  Also tidied up the 
remaining code in the save dialog to prompt for any solution, projects 
and files changes.  All in all, it's now working pretty well, so I can 
now create, save, close and open solutions!<br><br>Have some further 
work to do in the Solution Tree to allow users to rename, delete, change
 files etc, but cannot see this taking much more than a couple of days. 
 Once this is all done, will need to do some serious testing to make 
sure it's all hanging together properly and closely mimics VS2005.<br><br>At
 this stage I am probably still on target for the volunteer beta testers
 to begin testing in late February or early March.  Once their underway,
 I'll start having a crack at the GUI editor and code generation.<br><br>- GUI Editor -<br>As
 for the GUI editor, I'm still tossing up about the best way to do this 
stuff.  I can probably generate the code easily enough as the editor 
creates an XML template.  Just wondering how I will go about 
re-generating the form from the code itself.<br><br>Also thinking about 
generating forms to be stand-alone (I guess as per .Net) which you would
 create a type and display, but I've not yet had much of a play with 
MaxGUI (if anyone has any suggestions, drop me an e-mail!).<br><br>Its my birthday tomorrow - 35 - where do the years go!!!<br> <br><br> Regards,<br><br>Matt<br><br>Pentium4 2.4gHz, 2GB PC2700 Ram, 128MB ATI Raedeon 9600SE, Windows XP 32bit,<br>Dell Inspiron 6400 Laptop, T7200 2.00GHz Dual Core, 2GB Ram, GeForce 7300 Go, Windows Seven 64bit </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Solution Manager - Part 1</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-01-25)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Things always appear easier on first look, but as you go deeper...<br><br>Have
 created the New Project dialog and associated functionality - this part
 is working pretty well as I didn't have to change too much code (see 
first log for further info).  Most of the Create/Load/Saving of 
solutions is just about done.  Always like getting to this point as the 
IDE gets quite usable as you can open and close stuff.  Once this has 
all been tidied up, the Solution Tree will be re-added.  I can see the 
light!!<br><br>- Project Templates - <br>What I have also done is expand
 the project templates to be fully read from the plugins.  So for each 
language, I can create an xml template for any number of project types 
(template includes all sorts of information about files, settings and 
code etc), store it as a resource and process it once the user selects 
the required project type to create.  Should allow a lot of flexability 
and easy manipulation.  Later down the track I will do some sort of user
 templates to allow users to create their own project bases which will 
be available from the dialog.<br><br>As an example I can create a 
Windows Application template that will include a form (maxgui) and base 
starting file, or specific game project templates targeting DirectX, 
OpenGL etc.<br><br>- Discard or Save - <br>As in VS2005, you can have a 
quick play with a project, compile it etc and then discard it without 
essentially saving it into your project folders.  This has added some 
extra complexitiy to the process but don't have a lot much more to do 
here - should keep your system tidy without clogging up your project 
folder with rubbish.<br><br>On a side note, at cricket last Saturday I 
finally cracked my first 100! 132 to be exact - it's only taken 21 years

 I've been wanting to a do a worklog for quite some time, so now the 
website is finally up (www.projectstudioide.com), I thought the time is 
right.  I've always loved reading these sort of things and enjoy looking
 at everyone elses.  Reminds me of the old days reading ZZap64 - Andrew 
Braybook and Martin Walker had some great diaries which were always very
 insightful (there on the net, check them out).<br><br>Anyway, currently
 working on a re-write of the Debugger Tree - it's amazing, just when 
you think you got it worked out, something doesn't quite work or is 
really slow.  <br><br>Sat back and took a bit of a look over the last 
day or so - think I've finally cracked it!!!  The Blitz IDE appears to 
objectdump around 3 levels of data - here I thought it was the whole lot
 and was wondering why mine was so slow at times (playing with 
Digesteroids source, once it was into the main loop it would take 2-3 
mins to read the entire dump!)  Anyway after comparing to the Blitz IDE I
 suddenly found this limit. I've therefore created a process which 
allows the number of levels to be set - this should give a bit of 
flexability to read a bit deeper if necessary and it's very quick now - 
good show!  <br><br>The other feature I have included is the ability to 
skip over BlitzMax module code - this will allow the user to concentrate
 on their own code and not have to worry about stepping through this 
area.<br><br>- Solution Manager -<br>Next up is re-adding the Solution 
Manager back into the code.  I've already written it in the prior 
project I started in VS2003, so need to bring it over.  Once VS2005 was 
released, I upgraded it only to find a couple of thousand 'Code 
Analysis' issues (if you haven't used or heard of this feature, it scans
 your code against coding rules and advises where/how to fix problems - 
it really helps your coding thats for sure).  After seeing all these 
issues, I restarted the project in VS2005 and along with some upgraded 
controls in .Net 2.0, I'm very happy with the results.<br><br>Anyway, got a go and change the baby's nappy - until next time!<br> <br><br> Regards,<br><br>Matt<br><br>Pentium4 2.4gHz, 2GB PC2700 Ram, 128MB ATI Raedeon 9600SE, Windows XP 32bit,<br>Dell Inspiron 6400 Laptop, T7200 2.00GHz Dual Core, 2GB Ram, GeForce 7300 Go, Windows Seven 64bit </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
