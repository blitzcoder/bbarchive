Thanks Chris :-)<br>This
 means that instead of my crappy control-snapshot-as-panel-pixmap hack, 
you now see a live version of the control in question underneath the 
invisible panel, and when you click on the panel, the underlying control
 doesn't receive the event. Yay!<br><br>It makes development that little bit easier when things work similarly on the different platforms.<br><br>Still
 so much to work on, and lots up in the air. It will be nice to get the 
focus events stuff into Max at some point cuz without that, the 
properties panel isn't really going to work very well. But I'm sure the 
BRL guys are going to give that a reasonable priority... hey guys? ;-)<br><br>The
 dragging and dropping is working very nicely now. As you drag a control
 around the form, the "current parent" of that control is highlighted by
 a green box around its perimeter. So, if you drag from the window into a
 panel, the green box then appears around the panel. Once you release 
the mouse button, the panel becomes the new parent, and the control is 
removed from the old parent.<br>One wee problem with that which I have 
an issue on both Mac and Win32, is that the banding box of a child 
inside a panel won't accept mouse events. I'm thinking that it must be 
appearing underneath the parent container's invisible panel, which is a 
tad annoying. But it must be a Brucey bug as it is consistent on both 
platforms...<br>Still, it's looking quite good for now.<br><br>Things to finish :<br>* get all the controls added. (some sliders and such aren't available yet)<br>* get the xml format finished. It's half-done at the moment. Controls are storing their information appropriately.<br><br>Things to think about :<br>*
 The code generation I've still not gone near yet. As it doesn't need to
 be done til the editor is working, it'll probably end up last on the 
list.<br>* multi-selection of controls would be nice, for things like alignment, moving in groups, etc...<br>*
 alignment helper would be useful. You move a button and a line appears 
on the form to show you that your button is lined up with another 
control. Perhaps for that and control spacing.<br>* control layout in 
relation to their parent needs worked on. So when you resize a parent, 
the child will need to act accordingly. This will need to be done via 
code so that the size/position of the child is modified if required. In 
which case the child will have to physically be restrained to its actual
 position. :-)<br> <br><br> -+ Brucey +- <br><br>Come to  <a href="http://brucey.net/programming/blitz" target="_blank">Brucey's Modules</a> for useful <b>BlitzMax Modules</b>!! . . .

 Got some basic drag and drop running now...  You can click and drag a

 you are dragging the control around, it knows which "container" it is 
currently over, so when you drop it, it is removed from the old parent

stuff, where I snapshot a control to allow me to drag it : once the 
control (for example a button) is added to the panel, you can see it 
okay, but you can't click on it - since all you see is an image of the 
panel, not the control and its children.<br>So I dunno really. Haven't tried it on Mac yet - will do when I get home later - but hopefully that will work fine.<br>No idea what I can do with the win32 stuff now. just seems to me to be such a hack to get it to work.<br><br>The

can't test it yet due to the panel events bug thingy which is 
outstanding).<br>After having a rummage through the FLTK sourcecode

 so, with all good things, I added a check for an EVENT_MOUSEENTER, and 
used ActivateGadget() on my panel. And a small test seems to confirm 
that this should work.<br><br>It does still leave me with the rather

 plan was to place an invisible panel over the control, which would 
allow the control to be visible, but being in front would accept mouse 
events in priority of the control behind.<br>This works brilliantly in 
MacOS, and just the way I thought it should do. You click on the 
"control", but in actual fact you are clicking on the panel, with which 
you can do click and drag stuff with ease...<br>However, on Win32, if 
you cover a button with a panel (regardless of the panels' alpha 
settings) and then click on the panel, you actually click on the button,
 which comes to the front and depresses. Which kind of sucks really.<br>So
 either Windows works in a strange way, or MaxGUI isn't working 
properly. Personally, I would think that whatever gadget is on top 
should be the one accepting mouse events...<br>And then we move onto 
Linux. The issue I'm stumped with currently here is that if you have a 
panel on another panel, the embedded panel doesn't pick up any mouse 
events at all... which kind of defeats any usefulness.<br><br>Unless 
anyone knows a tidy way in win32 to be able to click on a control but 
not actually click on it (somehow hide the control from the event and 
catch it elsewhere) it looks like GED ain't gonna work very well on 
anything other than Mac...  ho hum.<br>(one other possibility would be 
to sense the mouse-enter onto the control, quickly grab an image of the 
current control, remove the control, place the image into the panel, and
 use that to move it around. Then when you mouse-leave, you reload the 
control and do away with the panel image....)<br>Anyone know how to capture window section images in win32 / linux?<br>...<br> <br><br> -+ Brucey +- <br><br>Come to  <a href="http://brucey.net/programming/blitz" target="_blank">Brucey's Modules</a> for useful <b>BlitzMax Modules</b>!! . . .

 In the name of good design (not!), I realized that I could probably use
 the Item List Editor framework to create editors for the TreeView (with
 nodes and Items) and Menus (with nodes and menus).<br>So, I created a super type called <i>TListEditor</i> from which my <i>TItemListEditor</i> now extends, in the process moving generic code from the subtype to the super.<br>The TreeView and Menu editors will use a TreeView list for construction.<br>This
 brings up an interesting quandry in that the TreeView editor would also
 like to use all Item controls that the Item List does, but the

 I had this other idea for the code-generation. Instead of saying, 
*this* is the format for the generated code you must use, I thought 
instead that we could define different generator classes (subtyped from a
 super type) and you could choose your preferred option.<br>I hate to

 differently. This way, the nice folks in the community could provide 
their favourite frameworks, for integration... (heh... well, we'll see 
how that goes)<br>So all we'd need would be a nice super type that you 
would extend to which you could write your own formatting....

 I thought it might be fun, seeing as the code for the IDE is available,

 the IDE rather than as a standalone application.<br><br>I would see it split into two parts, visually...<br><br>In

 parsing needs tightening up in places). Folding works great, after some

 I'm now happy with the code-folding... It updates when the outline view
 does, using the outline view document model (which saves on a whole 
parse).<br>I tracked the "change" problem down to the fact that even 
though I was passing in the updated model, I wasn't using it... 
*doh!*... funny how the obvious is sometimes the least obvious. Anyways,
 the hours that I've spent debugging the folding stuff means at least 
it's all very clear now.<br>The "type at the end of the document" 
problem was easy to find once the folding was working. Seems I was 
adding 1 onto the size of the "type" region, which meant that it ended 
on the next line (which, if the document ended by then meant that 
folding mechanism would try and fold off the bottom, caught itself, and 
decided not to try).<br>Yay for exception handling :-)<br><br>I've done a

 added a basic Action to Hide Imports on the outlineview. Kind of a 
proof-of-concept thing, and it works well. (ie. it does what it says on 
the tin). However, it closes all the treeview branches when it 
refreshes, which ain't so good. I hope I don't have to remember the 
status of every branch (open or closed)...<br><br>We now have a 
Preference page with a single entry currently - the Blitz Max path. From
 here we've got docs, compiler and mods. Yay.<br>I suppose one should be
 able to change syntax colouring, and perhaps the font too. Can't think 
of much else for now with regards the prefs...<br><br>Building is going 
to be an important issue. However, having toyed in BMX for a while, I've
 often found myself modifying a .bmx and automatically hitting the 
"rebuild" keys, and unfortunately breaking the compile as the .bmx in 
question isn't the "main" one, but a sub...<br>Why is that an issue? - 
Mainly because it creates debug binaries, and when it comes to building 
the main .bmx, there's an error of duplicate symbols and such.<br>Should
 there be somewhere that specifies a particular .bmx as the primary, or 
do we assume the user knows what they are doing, and let them build 
whichever they wish?<br>Or make available a slew of build options, and let them have fun...<br><br>Choices, choices...<br><br>:-)<br> <br><br> -+ Brucey +- <br><br>Come to  <a href="http://brucey.net/programming/blitz" target="_blank">Brucey's Modules</a> for useful <b>BlitzMax Modules</b>!! . . .

 - I think that the outlineview may require options to show/hide things

 next step, I think, once variables are working, will be to invest some 
time into setting up some preferences - most usefully, directions to the

bmk and all the mods.<br><br>And then... it's time to have a look at importing things...<br>I
 was thinking that perhaps the best thing is for the plugin to 
automagically load all the mods into memory at startup time. Kind of 
like an online mod-library. This should save mucho time when it comes to
 determining types and content assist - since only a quick-lookup will 
be required, rather than a load-and-search.<br><br>Also, I think folding
