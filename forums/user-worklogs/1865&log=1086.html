 #3 could be "You Escape" hehe. But regardless of how the outcome of the

 didnt die at all against him. Good points however if you manage the

added in a scrolling play area, but this killed the fps rate so I took 
it back out. The difference ran from an average of 61 fps without to 30 
fps with.<br><br>The player now spawns back where they died. If they are
 in the process of drawing then the spawn is back at the line's start 
point. <br><br>The code for drawing the electricity of the storm has been redone. It is much faster now and much more controlable.<br><br>16
 channels of sound are now in game. Still a few bugs of when a sound 
should be played, but not getting the problem where sounds conflicted 
with one another.<br><br>The AI's death and the subsequent destruction of the player's circuit board looks much better.<br><br>Looking Ahead<br>-------------<br>Mostly
 now its tracking down small bugs in the game. Along with that I intend 
to give the graphics and sounds another nice going over and incorperate 
the high score entry process a facelift. Also need to come up with an 
opening title shot. The code is really getting sloppy with the new 
additions and I've identified at least 4 more routines that need 
rewritten. This will most likley free up even more FPS and make it much 
easier to navigate within the code (boy i get lost tracking things down 
now sometimes hehe)<br><br>Another Demo Update that will allow more 
levels of playing, but will not include all the features of the game

 This is my first entry into the work log and my first game developed 
with BB. I started out early in programming back when I was about 14 and
 did write a few programs using Bally Basic, Atari, and Commadore 64, 
but I didnt pursue a programming career as I got older. Back then people
 didnt think much could be made for someone to write games where i was 
living lol.<br><br>High Voltage is a bit like Qix in that you have to 
fill a percentage of the screen while dodging bad guys. There are 
special items that you can pick up along the way and different level 
bosses that you face as you progress.<br><br>Being new to BB and way out
 of programming shape I find that alot of what do can be trimmed, and 
trimmed, and then trimmed again only to be trimmed once more by someone 
with experienced eyes. HV runs a bit slow in the higher levels and my 
goal is to fix that with trimmer code, all the while improving upon the 
game and eventually moving it into a 3d environment.<br><br>Basic game 
controls with arrow keys, and the left alt to move in slow mode for more
 points. Its also got joystick control with the main fire button acting 
as your slow mode button and the secondary button acting as the "space" 
bar needed to continue past info screens.<br><br>An HV demo has just 
been compiled and released so that I can begin getting outside feedback.
 More items, bosses, action, and game efficiency will be what I 
currently work at.<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
