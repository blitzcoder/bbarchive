 is a project I effectively shelved when I started to get my associates.
 I am now taking a break from school to work and finally revisit old 
projects and hopefully get them to an enjoyable state!<br><br>The game is inspired heavily from EV: Nova, but it doesn't mean I'm doing a straight clone of it. (If you don't know what <a href="http://www.ambrosiasw.com/games/evn/" target="_blank">Escape Velocity: Nova is...</a>)
 No, I love all types of space games and I'm taking some basic ideas 
from EV and are introducing my own and from other games to produce 
something unique.<br><br>So what IS this game then? It is hard to 
describe, but it's a 2D-top-down space shooter with EV:Nova style 
physics. You'll be able to either trade peacefully, hiring fighter 
escorts to protect you along with other freighters to help haul your 
load. Or you'll be able to turn pirate and attack said freighters, 
appealing their will to live to tell them to drop their cargo. Even 
better yet, you'll be able to join the military and fight in the war 
between the two big factions. At least that's the end goal, but the 
point is to create a decently big sandbox with high replay value and PEW
 PEW LASER BEAMS! :D<br><br>Currently I'm the only one really working on
 this project as programmer/designer/etc., but I'm not alone. Friends 
have helped out in the past that still helps and I have been talking to 
my awesome music/demo buddy to get some space music going and I've been 
contacting some of my other friends to help with ship sprites and fluff.
 If you have an eye for spriting mechanical things like space ships and 
space station at these scales, or can create high res (that is, 
1024x1024, 2048x2048 and up) planets and stars, I'll love to get in 
contact with you, but currently all of this is for free and is slated to
 be freeware. So I'm not begging anyone to come join but if this project
 interests you then you don't need to hesitate to contact me at 
Galaxy613@... or go to forums.iontrailproductions.com<br><br>That's the run down so far, enjoy some screenshots:<br><br><a href="http://s257.photobucket.com/albums/hh236/Galaxy613/?action=view&amp;current=screen015.png" target="_blank"><img src="11109&amp;log=1802_files/th_screen015.xml"></a> <a href="http://s257.photobucket.com/albums/hh236/Galaxy613/?action=view&amp;current=screen014.png" target="_blank"><img src="11109&amp;log=1802_files/th_screen014.xml"></a> <a href="http://s257.photobucket.com/albums/hh236/Galaxy613/?action=view&amp;current=screen010b.png" target="_blank"><img src="11109&amp;log=1802_files/th_screen010b.xml"></a><br><br>If you wish to try out the very early build, <a href="http://iontrailpro.b1.jcink.com/index.php?showtopic=140&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=1245" target="_blank">Click Here</a><br><br>That's
 it for now, I hope to have some real gameplay going before spring hits.
 But life is exciting right now so I'll keep on chugging and see how it 
turns out. :) Thanks for taking the time to read all of this! <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
