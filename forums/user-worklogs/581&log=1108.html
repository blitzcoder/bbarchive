 Far I have mod support working so a player can easily add new factions,
 characters, vehicles, ships, maps, etc.. by just adding a folder, model
 and txt file. I have an inventory working with weapons (not onto 
medipacks and stuff yet). I have different guns with different holding 
positions working and more can be added very easily. <br><br>Terrain is 
in using multitexturing so I have a colour map that spans the entire 
map, than I have a detail texture that is tiled over the terrain that 
gives it the detail. I have vehicle and weapon respawning which is 
determined in the txt file of that vehicle or weapon. plus I have 
managed to do a couple of effects, like explosions and sky.<br><br>I 
have vehicles in, you can use a tank or humvee ( the only vehicles I 
have added so far ) which have working turrets using the mouse to 
control, bullets, gun recoil, rotation with terrain and objects (just 
the castle from marks demo), gravity and damage. Also have animated tank
 tracks. Wheeled vehicles have the wheels spinning at the rate of the 
vehicles movement, and the front wheels turn for steering. Plus the 
basic stuff like, tracked vehicles can turn no matter what their speed 
is but wheeled vehicles turn depending on their speed, vehicle will not 
turn if they are off the ground nor will the accelerate.<br><br> I have 
net code that includes player positions, current weapon, Bullets, death,
 health, chat, Current vehicle, Vehicle position, rotation, Turret 
rotation and pitch, and respawning of weapons and vehicles. I’m using 
blitzplay for the network code, I haven’t done any sort of position 
prediction or position smoothing yet.      <br><br>I still need to add or complete:<br><br>- Realistic Vehicle Physics (Including rotation inertia, impact physics and those sort of things)<br>- Ships and Planes ( A lot still to do here ) <br>-
 Multiple Game Modes, like capture the flag, deathmatch, teamplay and 
C&amp;C mode ( from Command and Conquer Renegade, it is team play with 
money which you earn from killing enemies and a regular income, and with
 that you can buy better characters, vehicles or ships. Which in turn 
get built at you base in the weapons factory, barracks, or airfield. If a
 building is destroyed then you can't build any more of units of that 
type.)<br>- Singleplayer scripts and triggers  <br>- Create a story line and a name that fits well with my game engine (any ideas would be appreciated)<br>- Character animations ( Haven’t started with this yet either ) <br>- All the Menus <br>- Scoring <br>- BOTS ( I haven’t really looked into this yet but it would be a nice feature )<br>- Game Saving<br>- Wildlife and animated fauna<br>- Models ( I haven’t made any model that are specifically for the game because I don’t have a story yet)<br>- Refine and expand the network code<br>- Probably a lot more but I can’t think of it now<br><br>Well
 that all I have to tell for now, If anyone has any suggestions for the 
story or any other part of the game, or if you would like to contribute 
to it, please email me fishy418@...  <br><br>P.S. I'll post up some screenshots soon.<br> <br><br> P4 3.2, GF6600GT, 1GB RAM </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
