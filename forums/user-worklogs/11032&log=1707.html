 Unfortunately, due to money problems, I shouldn't get the full version 
of FastExt yet, so I have to scratch the cool looking water for the time
 being.<br><br>Also, due to a lack of a good host (anything allowing the
 file size to be big enough either requires payment or doesn't allow 
direct links), I've had to scratch the automatic updater for a little 
while.  Since I plan to update this game a lot even after it's 
"complete", this is an essential part, but I don't want to pay much on a
 non-profit project.  I'll look into making separate *.exe files for 
each version that will update the game, but it might be difficult.<br><br>Expect
 a version of the game with a mostly complete movement system 
soon(ish)...maybe...  Actually, there's a lot of work on my website 
right now, so generally I only have time to work on this when I don't 
have an internet connection, so I have no idea how long it'll take to 
get an update out.  Sorry all, but my website is more important. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Update</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-10-26)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> OK, there hasn't really been an update here for a while, so I figured I would post what I've been working on.<br><br>OK,
 the main thing I'm trying to make perfect is the movement system.  In 
this game, there will be two modes of movement: regular walking and hill
 surfing.  I have the regular walking part in there perfectly now, but 
the hill surfing is difficult to make the appropriate physics for.<br><br>For
 those of you who haven't played Fallen Empires, hill surfing 
is...well...it's hard to explain.  Think of running, but propelled by 
rockets, and held about a foot or two off the ground by some sort of 
force field to reduce friction to nearly 0.  There are also rockets to 
propel you a ways into the air before running out of energy and having 
to recharge, and those coupled with the forces of gravity and landing 
the right way on a hill can propel you to insane speeds.<br><br>I've 
also been working on the looks of the game.  The first thing was the 
terrain, which was much too tall, with little space to roam around.  I 
figured out there was a problem with how it was being scaled, and that's
 been fixed.  The terrain is still a little too small to actually play 
with, but it's perfect for testing, which is what I need for now.<br><br>I've
 also downloaded the FastExt library, started learning how to use it, 
and implemented some pretty good looking water!  That coupled with a 
skybox (ripped for the library for the screenshot below, it'll be 
replaced before I upload it as an update) and I'm starting to like the 
scenery.<br><br>And then comes particle effects.  What FPS can be 
complete without great particle effects for explosions and whatever?  
The only problem is that most of my experience is with making 2D games, 
where particle effects aren't that difficult to implement without some 
sort of library.  I'm using ParticleWorks, but it's difficult to get the
 settings just right.<br><br>The worst problem, however, is finding the 
right resources.  I mean, there's not exactly an abundance of good 
quality 3D models out there without some sort of legal strings, and the 
ones that are there don't really fit into my game as I'm visualizing it.
  I'm good with making my own 3D models in many cases, but I can't do 
life forms very well at all, and I have no experience with animating, 
though I could probably learn.<br><br>And the last thing is a little 
technicality with the update manager: it can't delete files, only add 
them, and it can't update itself.  I have a couple possible solutions to
 this problem, but I'm not so sure which I'll choose yet.  Don't be 
surprised if I don't allow an automatic update to the next version, and I
 make you redownload the whole thing.<br><br>Well, here's the latest screenshot.  It's starting to look pretty nice.<br><br><img src="11032&amp;log=1707_files/waterAndSkyBox.webp"><br><br>The
 only problem is the blue around the edges of the water.  Because of the
 distortion, the part of the reflection under the terrain is showing, 
which looks horrible because it's blue.  I'm not completely sure how to 
fix that yet, but I'll figure it out... <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>v0.1 ready for download</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-10-17)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 v0.1 is ready for download now.  So far it's just a terrain, some 
water, some music, and a flying camera, but the background code is all 
set for a lot more.<br><br>Why download this?  Right now, it's just to 
mess around with, keep tabs on my project if you want, whatever.  
Development will hopefully go somewhat quickly, so if you want automatic
 updates you can download this too.<br><br>Meh, whatever, if you want to download it:<br>http://download219.mediafire.com/4pmtjbyytkbg/my1mdyjhmgb/FPS+game.zip<br><br>(Why don't link tags work here?)<br><br>It's
 not much yet, so I'm not going to try to get you to download it yet.  
Once I get something in there that makes it worth downloading, I'll tell
 you.<br><br>I'm horrible at naming things, so it's not real obvious 
which is the main executable.  Technically the main exe is 
updateManager.exe, though fps.exe will run perfectly fine.  It just 
won't check for updates.<br><br>BTW, if you're running Vista (and maybe 
with other operating systems), you may receive a warning that the 
program is trying to access the computer and needs admin permissions.  
All it's doing is downloading the latest updates.  If you don't want 
this, you can always just run the fps.exe and download updates manually.
  I'll be uploading a new complete zip with each important update.<br><br>And
 it's hosted at MediaFire because the host for my website won't let me 
upload one file above 2mb.  If I use an external ftp client, I might be 
able to up that to at least 4mb, maybe unlimited, but then I would have 
to figure out how to use the thing.  That's simply not worth the time 
yet. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>First entry</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-10-16)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 OK, I started with BlitzBasic several years ago, before Blitz3D was 
released, and got pretty good after a while.  I then moved on to 
Blitz3D, but I wasn't ready to learn more yet and got sick of it.  Since
 then I've tried and become fairly skillful at 3D modeling, 2D graphics 
creation, and just about every aspect of web development.  Now I'm back,
 inspired, and ready to put all my skills to work making a game.<br><br>My
 inspiration came from Fallen Empire: Legions, from InstantAction.  The 
movement will be similar, though not the same, but hopefully that will 
be the biggest similarity.  I'm not out to break copyrights or anything.<br><br>So
 far I'm mainly just working on all the behind the scenes code.  It 
already finds the highest (if not the best) setting your graphics card 
can handle, and automatically runs at that resolution and color depth.  
It also automatically checks for and downloads updates each time the 
program is run, though it can't update the main executable for a simple 
reason: it's running.  As soon as I work around that (probably by making
 the download manager a separate file) I'll post a download link.<br><br>I'm
 using BlitzTiles for the terrain (thanks so much Krischan for coding it
 and Yasha for directing me to it), and I'm using the Download file code
 by Devils Child found in the code archives for part of the download 
manager.  The rest (243 lines at the moment) has been programmed from 
scratch.<br><br>I haven't made any external files from scratch yet, but 
that's coming.  Terrain and terrain tex was generated in L3DT, but that 
will be replaced.  The background music included with the game at the 
moment is from the Mod Archive, but I'm not so sure about the legal 
restrictions on them yet, so they're just being used as space holders 
until further notice.<br><br>First screenshot:<br><br><img src="11032&amp;log=1707_files/firstScreen.webp"><br><br>Problems that I'm aware of:<br>1. Update manager can't update the main exe<br>2. Terrain is too small to do much good when objects will be moving as fast as they're going to in this game<br>3. Water is too transparent from the top.  (Easy fix, I only just noticed it.)<br><br>Other things I'm working on:<br>1.
 The movement system.  I haven't even started it yet, but that's coming 
as soon as I get the update manager working and a terrain that I can 
test the movement system on.<br>2. A better looking terrain and all 
around environment.  Blitz3D isn't really meant for stunning graphics, 
but some particle effects like grass and dust flying when characters are
 moving will go a long way if they don't slow down the frame rate too 
much.  I'm not sure how exactly I'm going to obtain any of this, but I'm
 working on it.<br><br>I'll post more as I think of it.  Now it's back to work on that update manager... <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
