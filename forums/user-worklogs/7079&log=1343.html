 though tit would be simple to begin with but I sonn realised the number
 of possibilities that I hadn't accounted for and had to start part of

this as my new way of storing the data is alot more complicated when

 I managed to get delete working. This was quite simple due to the 
similarity to backspace. Testing it was difficult, there are so many 
senarios that I loose track. I did the important tests, or atleast 
important to me, which are basically checking that the whole 
word/character system doesn't get ruined by it, seeing as how this is 
the basis of the textarea I've wrote.<br><br>I also have to work out a 
way to simulate a character being held down for non ascii keys, such as 
delete and the arrow keys as they don't work with with EVENT_KEYCHAR 
which handles all the horrible stuff with ascii keys. It's getting 
annoying when a test requires quite a few lines and I have to tap my way
 backwards through what I've written.<br><br>I now want to finish off 
the non ascii keys which include, up, down, home and end. Once these are
 done I can move on to the textarea GUI and the scroll bars. They 
shouldn't be difficult as I was smart enough to realise I didn't want to
 go through all the maths of getting them working!!<br><br>After that I 
will upgrade the drawing routines for the various textarea parts so that
 it runs more efficiantly and I can start work on the rest of the IDE. <br><br> ----------<br>"There is nothing like a dream to create the future"<br><a href="http://www.mattvonfat.com/" target="_blank">MattVonFat.com</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Surprised It Works</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-09-13)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 I now have backspaces working perfectly! The best part is that it 
requires a method to join two words together in order to work well. This
 is the reverse of being able to write characters and start spaces in 
the middle of a word of line so this is will help later on!<br><br>I'm 
actually surprised this works so well. Only a few minutes ago I was 
writing a method which, like alot of the methods, has a similar 
structure with the only differences being in what it does at certain 
places. I thought to myself "Oh I need to remember to add *somefunction*
 for it to work right"<br><br>I then wondered whether I had put this 
check in else where. It turned out I had but I have to admit with my 
forgetfulness when it comes to programming I'm surprised anything works.

 I got new lines added, but in a certain way. I haven't yet got it so 
you can start a new line in the middle of a line. Only at the end and 
beggining. I will probably put off doing the middle of lines until near 
the end. I also have to impliment inserting a character (not a letter, 
things like symbols and numbers) in the middle of a line. This is 
dificult as I have to spilt lists up and do a whole load of swapping 
about.<br><br>With the addition of adding lines, I now have finished off
 my MoveBack method to account for lines and I have also completed the 
move forward method!<br><br>My final addition is red boxes around words 
and green boxes around characters. I decided to add this so I could make
 sure, when testing, that everything was in the right place. I might 
explain this a bit more in the next post. Basically two words can't be 
next to each other, if you write stuff to an existing word it should be 
attached to the existing word. And this, so far, seems to be the case! <br><br> ----------<br>"There is nothing like a dream to create the future"<br><a href="http://www.mattvonfat.com/" target="_blank">MattVonFat.com</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Psychic Coding</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-09-06)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 I was estatic today when I finished off the basic character input for 
the new IDE build. Yeah, I have a new one. This must be IDE #5 I think 
but I'm determined for it to be my last restart. It uses the same 
functions as the old IDEs but rewritten. I want to get the code as 
streamline as possible because as the textarea is written from scratch I
 want to make sure it's not slow by the end.<br><br>Anyway, my reason 
for being so happy was that I wrote the MoveBack method, which moves the
 cursor back, without being able to test it as I hadn't even written the
 methods that allow you to type! All I knew was that the code didn't 
throw any errors. I also wrote the typing methods which allowed 
characters to be entered in words before I could test. But when I ran it
 it worked perfectly.<br><br>Maybe I've just gotten so good with BlitzMax and coding in general to write flawless code!

 I got up to the stage of creating the main program type. This would 
create the GUI and hold the main loop. I gave it a bit of though and, 
while I am currently using a text program type, I will try and convert 
my old one to be used with the new one...that is one of the benifits of 
OOP right? It already contains a whole load of code for handling the 
scroll bars and other stuff that I really don't want to have to rewrite 
as it was hard enough the first time!<br><br>I also gave a bit of 
thought to function folding. I think I've settled on having a stack (or 
heap - I get them muddled up) type thing, which has a first one last off
 style. I will also have a simple type, possibly:<br><br><pre class="code">Type FoldEnding
    Field ID:Int       'Some form of auto number
    Field FoldType:?   'Possibly a string or ID for the thing i'm folding
End Type
</pre><br><br>which will be added, and each time an 'End Function' or 
'End Type' thing comes up it will check the stack and take the next item
 if it's the right type. It should only really have errors if the users 
code has errors. This could easilly be added to my syntax highlighter 
and if done right not add any noticeable slowdown. <br><br> ----------<br>"There is nothing like a dream to create the future"<br><a href="http://www.mattvonfat.com/" target="_blank">MattVonFat.com</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Wonders of OOP</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-06-15)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Well I finally have a CursorBack function which moves the psoition of the cursor back (surprise).<br><br>Its

 I tested what I had so far. The simple test, which worked with a single
 line, added the text "he-lo" to the line. What should have happend, and
 did happen (after I worked out a few OOP bugs I had), was it created a 
word which held "he", created a character which held "-" and then 
created a word which held "lo".<br><br>No wthat I have this simple code 
working all the other features should be easy to work out as I have a 
ground work of how the stuff is stored.<br><br>The most imortant part 
for me to get implemented now is to be able to move the cursor position 
with the arrow keys. Apart from moving the cursor position by clicking 
with the mouse this is the hardest part of the new system. It will also 
let me see how my code will work when it comes to enetering text in the 
middle and at the beginning of words. <br><br> ----------<br>"There is nothing like a dream to create the future"<br><a href="http://www.mattvonfat.com/" target="_blank">MattVonFat.com</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Best of Both Worlds?</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-05-30)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> If only!<br><br>I haven't focused 100% on this recently (partly because I need a job!) but I have realised that this will be difficult.<br><br>It

 Well I managed to get a basic text-editor with syntax highlighting 
working. It's still quite messy though so I thought that rather than 
going through and cleaning it up now I'd try a few different things out.<br><br>I
 don't think that I have the best data storage for what I'm doing. I had
 TDocument types which stored TLine types. And the TLine types stored 
characters.<br><br>This would be good for a word processor as it means 
each character could have different formatting. But as all I want is 
words to have formatting I am going to substitute TWord for TLine. So 
now each line will contain words. This should also help with syntax as I
 no longer have to find the words as the syntaxer runs...the words are 
already stored and ready for checking.<br><br>I was going to try another
 method with TParagraph instead of TLine. But as programming is quite 
line focused as opposed to writing which is more paragraph focused I 
decided that I won't bother with this trial. But if I ever decide to 
modify my IDE to a word processor I will have a few ideas on which to do
 it. <br><br> ----------<br>"There is nothing like a dream to create the future"<br><a href="http://www.mattvonfat.com/" target="_blank">MattVonFat.com</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Syntaxing</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-05-09)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Well I added syntax highligting and found that my original version

 line checker which makes it work a whole lot better.<br><br>The screen checker has been kept for when it first loads but thats all it's used for.<br><br>What
 happens when you open a doc in it is it loads it completely then does 
syntax highlighting on what you can see on screen. Then as you get to 
work it goes through every line off screen and highlights it. This works
