 Now that we passed safely 7 days of on and off work, I'm releasing 
TURBOCHOMP as an alpha (now alpha3).  I've added a couple of things 
which are cosmetic, but also some things for slower computers (CTRL-E to
 turn off post processing effects).  There is an 800x600 cfg file in the
 download too, which you need to place in same directory as 
TURBOCHOMP.exe). <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Extensive gameplay tweaking</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2008-08-07)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Got some more work on gameplay features and basic controls.  TED now 
moves only when keys are pressed.  This helps giving more depth in 
gameplay.  The stars are now useful.  When you pick up stars, you then 
have advantages for gameplay, where a star will guarantee you 10 seconds
 extra when picking up a "time" tile.  The star will also abolish 
loosing time when tripping over the multicolor disc.  Finally, a star 
will help you teleport from/to other teleports instead of more random 
places.<br><br>I've programmed zombie AI.  Now there will be levels with
 roaming zombies!  This starts at level 16.  The zombies are pretty 
predictable in their movements.  But if they bump on each other, they go
 to other places and it get's a little interesting there.<br><br>The 
object that looks like a cucumber has a purpose now.  I call it the 
cement mix.  When you step on one, it creates a cement cube right beside
 you.  That can block your path.  So, this is something that can really 
alter gameplay a lot as it can block passages.<br><br>I fixed tons of 
bugs, but I fear there are many others that I haven't seen yet.  But, 
compared to the submission I made last monday, it is far more 
interesting!  Now I have to make more zombie infested levels, with 
cement mixes and teleports and stars :P  Oh joy!<br><br>You can get the latest version of the game here: <a href="http://hosted.filefront.com/JackMoore/" target="_blank">http://hosted.filefront.com/JackMoore/</a> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Levels, visual effects, gameplay</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2008-08-03)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 I've worked on pretty much all of the aspects of the little game.  Each
 levels are less than one minute gameplay, averaging about 30 seconds.  A
 lot of the game is based on the player's dexterity maneuvering TED 
across the mazes.  As I was developping the game, I also created levels 
(9 levels done for now, want to increase that 10 folds :P).  I find the 
levels 1 to 9 myself pretty easy!  In fact, level 1 to 9 can be done 
without loosing a life fairly easy.  Levels 10 and above will get a 
little tougher.  Gameplay elements are added as the levels progress.<br><br>The
 graphics portion will stay pretty much the same across the levels as I 
use the same tiles, but I'll try to vary the levels enough to keep 
interest.  I use Fast Extend for the Post Processing effects, various 
fades, contrast, blur effects.  Zooming is done with Fast Image through 
Grid Terminal commands.<br><br>That raps it up for today :)<br><br><img src="10319&amp;log=1625_files/turbochompbf8.html"> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>First tries at a platformer</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2008-07-31)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 I always wanted to make a simplistic 2D platformer game.  Like a 
pacman, but even simpler, but, more fun and more colorful, with music 
across the game.  With the little work I did this week, I've got a main 
character whose name is TED (The Head) who is the pacman in this game.  
Also got a level style.  The graphics are crude, but they are all 
animated, which should enhance the visuals a bit.<br><br>Some stills of the WIP game:<br><img src="10319&amp;log=1625_files/term1450739pv6.html"><br><img src="10319&amp;log=1625_files/term30083332pa8.html"><br><img src="10319&amp;log=1625_files/term101924504fb0.html"> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
