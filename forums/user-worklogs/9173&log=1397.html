 So, yesterday i went out and got a package-deal with Starcraft, 
BroodWar and Warcraft 3 for a measly $20 at the local game-store here in
 stockholm. Im not a fan of WC3 because of the heroes, xping and creeps 
and stuff. The balance of the heroes makes the other units feel 
completely useless, but i guess its a matter of learning how to play it.
 Im a long time fan of starcraft, so it was no problem jumping in and 
wopping the AI ass over and over again. I think the AI is very 
impressive in starcraft, but i also know the AI is cheating. He knows 
where you are from start, and probably knows the whole map at all times.
 But it surely makes for a good AI. I compare it to the AI in RedAlert 2
 witch i recently tried, witch basicly sits back at one base, sends a 
few tanks now and then, builds some superweapons and attacks you, not 
much more from the games i played. If you check the box "No 
superweapons", it wont be the same tech-race, instead the AI just sits 
there and sends some tanks now and then. By building a perimiter of 
units around his base you can stop his cashflow, but the sad thing is, 
once you can do that, you probably have enough to wipe his base out 
anyways. The thing that makes starcraft so interesting, is the need of 
more than one rescource. I think thats key to making the game more about
 control of key-locations, to force the player to expand once he has 
drained one area of rescources. Im gonna watch the starcraft AI 
extensively over the next few days, maybe putting a few "insane" AI's 
against eachother and se what happens.<br><br>As Always, if anyone have any hints, links or other valuable info, email me! <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Research</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-11-06)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Im currently researching how to build a RTS game. I have a fair amount 
of previous knowledge about programming and making games, so i believe i
 have what it takes, but i dont wanna do any stupid mistakes, so im 
trying to find all the right ways to do this from the start. This way i 
will hopefully have fewer surprises later on. Im currently studying 
starcraft immensly and trying to grasp all of its dimensions. (being a 
long time fan i have been playing it countless hours in lan-parties). 
One part that will be important is network-code. I will need both LAN 
functionality and online functionality. The reason for this is that it 
aint worth building an RTS if people cant play against eachother, or 
co-op against one or several cpu's. I have never built 
networkfunctionality before, so that will be an area of research. Im 
trying to figure out how to build the game so that this part can be 
added later, so i need to organize how games and players are handled. 
Basicly, i will from the beginning create a skirmish-mode, where you can
 select number-of players, and assign different cpus to different teams 
etc, and try to get all that working.<br><br>About the selectable races 
in this RTS. I have decieded that there will be 3 playable-races, of 
witch 2 are based on humans, and the 3rd is an alien race. I have 
outlined the alien-race witch will have a unique gameplay for this kind 
of game. Im trying to make the races gameplay as different as possible 
now in the designphase, they are relying on totally different 
technologies and weapons, so this will be featuring a 
rock-paper-scissors mechanics between the three races. At this point i 
wont reveal much more about the three races.<br><br>As always, if you 
have any hints or tips about how to best solve this or that problem when
 making an RTS, email me at contact@... <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>The first post</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-11-05)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Ok, i guess we all know how it goes. I have been making games for quite
 some time now, and still i have hardly ever actually completed more 
than one game. I have a couple of projects on ice at the moment. I 
believe it is because most projects is a challenge for the programmer, 
and for me atleast, i think i want to check and se if i have the skills 
and brains to solve the problems related to the gameproject at hand. 
When i have overcome the major technical difficulties i often loose some
 inspiration/lust to code and from there on its often downhill. Also, 
you can realize that this gameproject youre currently working on is way 
to big and if you just had a few other people there to help you out it 
would be really great. Anyways.. At my school (The Royal Institute of 
Technology, Stockholm Sweden) there is an annual competition called 
Swedish Game Awards. So since i found out about a year ago, i wanted to 
enter the competition. Mostly to have a goal to work towards, one that 
feels serious. Me and a classmate was supposed to be making a game for 
this year, but our project is still just in early idea-phase, so i doubt
 we will be able to enter the competition this year. <br><br>Anyways. I 
am a huge fan of Starcraft, and RTS games, (but the only one i really 
like that much so far is starcraft and age of empires). In a recent 
coarse in school we learned about abstract datatypes, problemsolving 
trees, and sorting-algorithms and more. I thought now that i know much 
more, i would like to make a more challenging game. I think that the 
devious thing about thinking, "hey, i wanna make a very simple game, 
this game is so simple it will only take a week to complete" and then 
featurecreep comes in, i think it is because of the lack of challenge in
 the coding, witch really is kind of like the ultimate game for a coder.
 We are constantly looking for new challenges. So i think this new 
RTS-game im planning feels really exciting, its luring me in more and 
more.<br><br>Anyways, i have a black book where i write down all 
gameideas that pop up in my head, so far i have filled around 140 pages 
with drawings, and some nonsense to, as well as a lot of text here and 
there. So i have started to draw and plan some basic features of 
gameplay. Today i tested RedAlert 2 and the gameplay feels so 
light-weight compared to starcraft. Its like the tanks weighs less than a
 soldier, and the buildings fall over so easy, it doesnt take much force
 to take down an enemy base, but same goes the other way around. I much 
more prefer the gameplay feel in starcraft where the buildings are much 
more durable, and where there are more punch in the fights. Thats the 
focus i will have, also, since im only one person, i will focus minimal 
efforts on the graphics, i will use placeholder gfx for everything, 
simple squares with descriptive text for buildings, basicly everyhting 
will look pretty ugly at first, but that will let me concentrate on the 
actuall game.  The only thing i might expand ealy on graphically is some
 basic units and explosions/weaponeffects, just to have something. <br><br>I
 will be on the lookout for someone to make graphics for this and other 
of my games in the future, so if you know someone good (preferably 
swedish) of if you are good, hit me an email at contact@...<br><br>Also, if anyone have any tips regarding making an RTS, please email me with any hints to the above mentioned email adress.<br><br>Until next post, later folks//steve <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
