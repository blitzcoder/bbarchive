issue.  So for months i guess nobody could run a server, this has 
prompted me to tinker with Tiny Tanks again.  I am working a lot lately

 scenery is in and working great , ive spent the last few days tweaking 
it some more and getting more map options in.  I think there should be 
things happening in a map besides what the players are doing so I added 
what ive described below.<br><br>I have added several map options, wich are tweakable per option type in the map editor .<br><br>First
 main class is teleporters, predifined scenery objects represents the 
teleporter visual representation.  In the map editor you can drop a 
teleporter class, and define wich team can use it. If its a source pad, 
or destination pad. Also you can set if the player can do both ways or 
only from source pad to destination pad.<br><br>  You can drop damage 
areas, assign particle effects to them and tell them wich teams to 
effect as well as put them on timers or intervals.  Also you can create 
the same effect for "special" actions. So far all the predefines I have 
are<br>listed below.. Each defined type can be tweaker per map by the editor<br><br><br>Damage (either pos or negative.. hurt/heal)<br>Slow<br>Speed<br>Invisible<br>Spring (toss the the player if they touch it)<br><br>Here
 is a shot showing the damage areas put into action on am map in the 
form of fire chambers that turn on for 20 seconds, then off for 5.<br><br>
  You can also see in the distance some blue things. (not a good shot of
 them) but they in 10 second intervals slow you down , while displaying 
the effect of wind cmming to them. (a magnetic ripple).<br><br>  The possibilities with just hese few classes are pretty neat.<br><br>This shot was taken in "performace mode" wich limits effects, draw range and removes the toon outlines.<br><br><img src="69&amp;log=1686_files/tinytank_progress13.gif"> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Still moving along</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-06-09)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">

glitch that, when triggered caused a player to click across the 
playfield instead of move smoothly.   <br><br>I still have no dedicated server line to test with , so all my testing is still on a private network.<br><br>I also added alot of functional improvements such as <br><br>).when
 you cap a flag, it returns to its base but can no longer be picked up 
right away.. Instead there is a 30 second window that it cannot be 
grabbed.  This has a visual cue of the flag being mostly transparent on 
its base.   I was concerned with cap trains, where one person waits on 
the base when another caps.  <br><br>). I have taken a recommendation and added soft shading to the game, removing the flat look it once had.. Screenshot below.<br><br>).

 struck with an EMP you slow down and cannot fire for awhile.  The 
victim of this attack needs an immunity to another attack for a duration
 longer than the effect itself.  I found out that you can be grieved by 
chain EMPs<br>There also needs to be a visible cue to show you are now 
immune to emp and/or under the effect of one.  otherwise it looks like a
 bug when a tank is moving half speed with no indicator why.<br><br>2.<br>Land
 Mines need a small delay to "Arm" themselves after hitting the ground. 
 immediate detonation if an enemy is nearby makes them too powerful with
 their huge damage and radius.<br>3.<br>Sniper Cannon needs quicker reload times.  and slightly higher damage.<br>4.<br>Weapon sight for sniper and repair blaster should have longer view range.<br>5.Voice Sounds somtimes play very loud, some time they dont play very load at all..

traffic light, and still allow user moddable scenery obstructions I 
created a theme, wich is around the map there may be Holographic Shield

map editor can have any scenery object attached to it anywhere on the
