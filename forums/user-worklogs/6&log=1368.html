 creating the levels - I've reached 56 out of 60 now, so hopefully I 
should be done within a couple of days. I've had a lot of fun creating 
the levels, the ideas have flowed quite freely thankfully and each level
 is quite different from the others. Level editing was made easier by 
the fact that I spent so much time on the editor, so I basically could 
create anything I wanted to very quickly and efficiently.<br><br>Without
 beating my own drum too loudly, I have to admit I'm very pleased with 
pretty much all of the level designs, and in particular some of the 
later ones are a lot of fun to play. Even though I've been making the 
game now for over two years, I still enjoy playing it, especially with a
 GameCube pad!<br><br>Anyway, apart from the remaining four levels there
 is still one or two things to be done but I'm definitely at the 99% 
done stage now and a September release now looks a certainty.<br> <br><br> Si. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>SHB</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2004-06-07)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> 7th June 2004<br><br>Can't believe it's been six months since my last worklog. Time flies...<br><br>So
 what have I done since then? Well, lots of things, all of which mean 
that SHB is thankfully nearing completion. All that's left to do is 
create a few more levels, add some more background graphics, and a few 
other bits and bobs. The game should be 99% complete by the end of the 
month, and then I intend to spend a further month tweaking it and 
polishing it before finally releasing it.<br><br>Of all the things I've 
done in the past six months, the one thing I'm probably most proud of is
 the polygon optimisation routine. Due to the fact that SHB's editor 
requires you to stick pieces together to create levels, there was 
previously a lot of polygon wasteage. However, I coded a routine that 
checks for hidden faces between all the pieces, and this has reduced 
polygon counts drastically. This optimisation along with a few others 
means that SHB runs quite well even on old graphics cards, which has 
been my aim all along.<br><br>I've also been working on the graphics quite a bit:<br><br><a href="http://www.supergerball.com/worklog/shb_07-Jun-2004_0.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="6&amp;log=1368_files/shb_07-Jun-2004_0_thumb.jpg"></a> <a href="http://www.supergerball.com/worklog/shb_07-Jun-2004_1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="6&amp;log=1368_files/shb_07-Jun-2004_1_thumb.jpg"></a><br><br><a href="http://www.supergerball.com/worklog/shb_07-Jun-2004_2.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="6&amp;log=1368_files/shb_07-Jun-2004_2_thumb.jpg"></a> <a href="http://www.supergerball.com/worklog/shb_07-Jun-2004_3.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="6&amp;log=1368_files/shb_07-Jun-2004_3_thumb.jpg"></a><br><br>The next worklog will be the last one, so fingers crossed it won't be another six months before it appears :)<br> <br><br> Si. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>SHB + Gile[s]</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2003-12-06)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> 6th December 2003<br><br>I

 Virtually finished the frontend. I've spent quite a bit of time on 
this, but I think it has been worth it as it looks quite nice and is 
quite extensive.<br><br>* Added a tutorial mode.<br><br>* Reorganised 
the internal structure of the source code. It's now much cleaner and 
easier to add additional game modes, which I will be doing soon.<br><br>*
 Split the main game into four difficulty settings - easy, medium, hard 
and super hard. Each difficulty setting has 20 unique levels, except for
 super hard which has 10. So the game has 70 levels altogether.<br><br>So this is what is left to be done:<br><br>* Design the rest of the levels.<br>* Finish creating the room backgrounds. I may use Fredborg's excellent Gile[s] program to lightmap these.<br>* Add additional game modes.<br>* Add music and sound effects.<br>* Add high score tables and online high score tables.<br><br>So,
 still quite a bit to be done, but a release early next year is still 
definitely on the cards. I had considered releasing a cut down version 
without some of the additional game modes and levels before releasing an
 improved version, but have decided to try and create maximum impact 
with the first version.<br> <br><br> Si. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Super Hamster Ball</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2003-10-30)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> 30th October 2003<br><br>Well
 that workplan thing fizzled out - I'm just not sort of developer who 
can work in a very structured way very well. So instead over the past 
few weeks I've been working on various bits and bobs.<br><br>The two 
main things I've been working on have been the menu system and a dynamic
 collision system. A dynamic collision system I felt was important 
because with a game like Super Hamster Ball, which basically consists of
 moving along platforms, it can add so much more to the game.<br><br>Of 
course though, Blitz3D does not support dynamic collisions natively, so 
it was a bit of a struggle to say the least to get them working. 
Thankfully though, in the end I managed to get a near-perfect dynamic 
collision system working, and I'm very happy with it. You can now have 
levels that have tilting platforms etc.<br><br>The menu system has been 
easy enough to program, what has been hard though has been trying to 
find a visual style for it that I liked. I've got through lots of 
different ideas and combinations over the past week or two, but 
thankfully I've now settled on something which suits the game well.<br><br>So
 now what remains to do is some more integration work between the menu 
system and game, some graphics still need to be done, and a few more 
levels designed.<br><br>Oh, and the sound fx and music still need to be 
created to, but seeeing as I have zero talent when it comes to music, I 
am hoping to hire someone who can make a few tunes and sound fx for me.<br><br>All
 being well, a first private beta of Super Hamster should be ready by 
1st December. Originally, I had hoped to release Super Hamster Ball by 
then, but I will probably need another month for polishing off, creating
 the website etc. So I will probably aim for the very start of next year
 as a release date. <br><br> Si. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Super Hamster Ball</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2003-09-10)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> 11th September 2003<br><br>Well
 I've finally taken the plunge and decided to go it alone as a 
self-employed indie games developer and also Blitz Research web/docs 
guy. Lots of factors played a part in my decision, but the main one was 
that I actually wanted to try and make a living out of something I enjoy
 doing. If I fail so be it; at least I'll have given it a go. Last 
Friday was my last day at work and I registered as self-employed on 
Monday.<br><br>So now that I will have more time on my hands now, I have
 mapped out a work plan for Super Hamster Ball for the next 12 weeks, 
dedicating one week to each particular aspect that still needs to be 
done, which should take me through to the game's completion on 
(hopefully!) December 1st.<br><br>This week is dedicated to adding more 
'hazard' types to the game that basically affect the speed or direction 
of the hamster ball. Monday I added friction surfaces and scrolling 
surfaces (conveyer belts). Yesterday I added 'pushers', or springs. <br><br>Today
 I added 'steel balls' to the game, a bit like the black marble in 
Marble Madness. Basically it's just a heavy ball that can roll around 
and knock you off the side of the level.<br><br>All was going well until
 I tried getting more than half a dozen of them running at once. Due to 
the fact that my game updates at 300 times a second (for various 
reasons), 300 physics updates for 6 or more balls, was resulting in 
massive slowdown. So to try and solve the problem, I devised a nice 
little routine which means that rather than the balls having a physics 
update per game loop each, there is just one ball physics update per 
game loop which the balls take in turn to 'share'. So now the frame rate
 remains rock steady no matter how many balls you have in the level at 
once. They all move about smoothly as well, due to some nice 
interpolation tricks.<br> <br><br> Si. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Super Hamster Ball</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2003-08-20)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Thursday 21st August 2003<br><br>Despite
 the fact that there hasn't been a worklog for nearly a year now, work 
is still progressing on Super Hamster Ball. Actually, as the project has
 progressed, the development momentum has grown and grown, to the point 
where I am spending at least a few hours a day on it now.<br><br>It will
 still be a few months before the project is completed (still aiming for
 a late 2003 release), but the end is at least is now in sight. The 
level editor, which on its own has grown into quite a large project, is 
now 99% complete in terms of functionallity. There is still some work to
 do in improving its graphical interface, but more on that later. The 
main core of the game is also virtually complete, with the remaining 
task largely being one of creating media and levels.<br><br>One of the 
reasons the editor has took so long, is that all along I have programmed
 it with the intention of releasing it as part of the game. This I feel 
is vital I feel to extend the game's longevity. However, with Super 
Hamster Ball being a 3D game, with lots of scope for changing many 
aspects of each level, it has a took a while to fit everything in, *and*
 make it accessible to your average user. Thankfully I think I've 
achieved this, however as mentioned before some work remains to be done 
on making it look less like an editor, and more like an integral part of
 the game.<br><br>As for the game, well things haven't progressed a 
great deal in the grapical stakes since I posted the last screenshot on 
the Super Hamster Ball website back in April, however, the whole look of
 the game has been decided on. Before, I was unsure what style to give 
to the levels, so for the purposes of the aforementioned screenshot, I 
used a Terragen sky-box, which kinda looked out of place.<br><br>Anyway,
 in the end I decided that the game itself would take place within the 
confines on your average family home - the inspiration for this coming 
in part from an old 8-bit game called 'Henry's House'. So, in the final 
game there will hopefully be six rooms, with 8 levels in each - these 
'rooms' being the garden, garage, kitchen, kids bedroom and attic, plus 
possibly a couple of bonus levels. Objects that you might normally 
expect to find in each location will make up the obstacles - so for 
example in the bathroom, you might have to navigate a soap object, which
 of course will be slippy to move across.<br><br>At the moment though to
 speed things up and seeing as I'm not the greatest 3D modeller in the 
world, I'm currently considering contracting the 3D work, and possibly 
even level design as well, to an outside source. I've already made 
enquiries and although the work would likely cost in the region of 
£1000, I feel it would possibly be worth it if I want to speed up 
development a little.<br><br>I'm also considering swapping my full-time 
job for a part-time one so I can spend more time on my indie game and 
Blitz commitments, however that is still to be decided.<br><br>Finally, some new screenshots.<br><br><img src="6&amp;log=1368_files/shb_21-August-2003_0.gif"><br><br>A screenshot from the editor.

 things are moving along at a steady, if not spectacular, rate. The 
level editor is coming along nicely, and using pre-formed pieces, which 
can be manipulated in lots of different ways, some really 
intricate-looking levels can be formed:<br><br><img src="6&amp;log=1368_files/shb_17-Aug-2002.jpg"><br><br>As
 for the game, not much progress has been made. I've recently being 
trying to implement a proper dynamic camera system, however this is 
proving VERY problematic - mainly due to the complex level rotating 
system. At the moment I'm not sure if I will even be able to implement 
such a camera system at all, which obviously would a big blow for the 
game. I'll keep trying though to the bitter end :)<br><br>As for off the
 field activities, there's been quite a bit happening. Firstly, and 
quite unexpectedly, the Super Hamster Ball project and website got a 
mention in Edge Magazine. Now, I have been an Edge reader since it 
started, and to have a game of mine mentioned in there was a great 
honour for me. Admittedly, it was only really because of the novel 
nature of the game's title, but hopefully once the game has been 
properly revealed, it will be able to gain another mention based on the 
quality of the program.<br><br>Also, there have been some very tentative
 discussions going on about a possible publishing agreement for SHB. The
 publisher is very new on the scene, however is fully trusted and very 
reputable. <br><br> Si. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Super Hamster Ball - The Real Work Starts</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2002-05-18)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">

 got a very nice surprise today when checking my email. Completely out 
of the blue, someone sent me an avi of a hamster model they had done for
 Super Hamster Ball, and it suits the style of the game really well. I'm
 now just waiting to hear back from the person, so hopefully I can 
receive the model as well as the avi :)<br><br>I also started the level

 I cracked the background rotation problem, and as a result, the game's

 there.<br><br>I've also been thinking about the game's level editor and physics system. I will be working on these next.<br><br>----------<br><br>Friday 10th May 2002<br><br>I
 did some character sketches today. My aim was to come up with a simple,

 also spent some time on the control system. The level now tilts 
correctly relative to the camera and also the ball moves correctly 
relative to the level. I just need to get a decent camera system worked 
out now and also get the background to rotate properly.<br><br>----------<br><br>Wednesday 8th May 2002<br><br>Today
 I started a new project. It's called 'Super Hamster Ball', and is a 3D 
ball-rolling action game in which you tilt the level to roll the ball. 
What I'm aiming for is something fun, cute, colourful, simple to play 
and something that will appeal to a wide range of players. <br><br>Programming-wise,
 today I just knocked together a quick prototype to see if the level 
tilting concept can be done. And guess what it can. I'm actually quite 
pleased with myself because this seemingly requires sphere -&gt; moving 
poly colisions. However, I have found a way around this, and you can't 
tell the difference.<br><br>Here's a screenshot from the prototype, using any old textures that I could find:<br><br><img src="6&amp;log=1368_files/shb_08-May-2002.jpg"><br><br>I have set up a website for the project.
