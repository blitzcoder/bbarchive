 Due to the massive overhaul of the EKD Engine (See separate Worklog) 
I've tinkered and streamlined the direction and proposal for PARIS as 
well.<br><br>I will also convert its general naming conventions to suit 
the EKD engine, although I will not use any existing functionality from 
the Engine. The purpose is, that although I will ensure interoperability
 so that PARIS can be used by products built with the engine - I need to
 ensure that PARIS is kept separate so it can work "stand-alone" (albeit
 plugged-in to whichever application it's being used for.<br><br>So, 
although the variable and function naming will follow the stanndards 
defined for the EKD Engine, no functions from the Engine will by used by
 PARIS, and if similar are required, well, it's a small price to pay 
that there may be these duplicates (albeit named differently - EVERY 
PARIS function/variable/Object type has the prefix "PARIS")<br>in an app[lication that is built from the Engine but making use of PARIS.<br><br>_____________________________________________<br><br>So what's the result of this tinkering?<br><br>The
 Structure has been streamlined a little. I've had to forego the rather 
unnecessary concept of No Globals - especially where tracking counters 
and Importing/Exporting are required), and even added some Constants to 
make reading Bitwise flags easier.<br><br>To aid the actual workload / 
timescale of actually programming the details such as the PARIS_Update()
 function (the 'guts' of the beast), I've decided to open it up a little
 in terms of efficiency temporarily - for example, many functions are 
currently accepting the actual TypeObject as parameters or returning 
them. This is faster of course, and easier to work with for ME - though 
later, once it's all in a more complete state, I shall go back and 
create some wrappers to use the "Friendly Name" parameters in order to 
make it more accessable for others to make use of.<br><br>Another issue 
with speed is using Single Surface systems. I'm still not entirely 
confident with this, and am not sure how best to maximise performance 
with such objects spread across multiple Particle types or Emitters.<br>This is something I hope to return to, but for now, again,m keeping it simple, I'm using good ol' B3D Sprites. (eugh!)<br><br>By making such sacrifices now, it should allow me to flush out the heart of the workings. NNot bad for a year and a half, eh? <br><br> ____________________<br><div class="quote">  <br>lawks a lordy, my bottom's on fire!<br> <br></div> ~<i>marksibly</i> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Nothing to see here folks</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2010-08-15)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Summer's been long, hot and sunny.

 concerns are to ensure the base funcitons are complete and all present.
 I've got a feeling there's a lot I'm missing but cannot seem to think 
what they are. Regardless, at some stage later, as necessity dictates or
 as feature requests they will all be identified but I'd rather have the
 work completed more orderly. <br><br> ____________________<br><div class="quote">  <br>lawks a lordy, my bottom's on fire!<br> <br></div> ~<i>marksibly</i> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>The Basics</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2010-06-07)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 This is a complete and highly powerful Particle Engine which not only 
autonomously controls all particle activity autonomousy, but can be 
easily integrated into ANY existing codebase. So it's not only good for 
starting off, but can quickly be added to existing projects, or replace 
less advantageous solutions.<br><br>Also featuring a unique ability to 
generate and modify particle effects within the runtime of your code, so
 for example, emitters can be visually placed accurately within the 
current 3D world.<br><br>Batch processing and eficient links to existing
 media as well as interaction with any in-game entities or game states 
is all possible as well as traditional user abilities to manipulate 
Emitters during the gameplay.<br><br>Will be VERY easy to control, but huge potential.<br><br>PARIS
 can be loaded/unloaded wholly or inpart within the code to preserve 
memory at all times, making it the most powerful, AND eficient Particle 
solution for Blitz 3D in existence. <br><br> ____________________<br><div class="quote">  <br>lawks a lordy, my bottom's on fire!<br> <br></div> ~<i>marksibly</i> </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
