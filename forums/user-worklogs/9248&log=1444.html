 I have started working on what was originally called "Cobalt" again, or
 anyway I've realized that I am working on something so similar they 
might as well be the same thing. This time around it is called 
IntersticeMud and I have some really specific goals as far as 
functionality and interface go that I didn't have before, hopefully 
those will help drive me towards actually getting this thing working. <br><br>To
 increase accessibility of the project, the language I'm using for 
scripts is a bit more mainstream and no longer LISP based (although I 
still like the idea of "no syntax", but that's for a different 
discussion, I realize most people don't "get it"). So anyway, right now 
I'm working with a module I've used in the past, MicroC, which has 
worked very well for me so far.<br><br>I have got the database up and 
running, using SQLite for now, but it's all based on brucey's DB modules
 so if I need to switch to MySQL, etc. it's simply a matter of changing 
the driver string and fixing up the SQL statements (all in a block of 
constants at the top, thank you). The client obviously needs a cache 
database, and that will probably always be SQLite even if the server 
needs to change at some point.<br><br>Right now I am looking at the 
networking code. At first I wanted to use something like GNet just to 
keep my own work to a minimum, but I realized I was fighting the rest of
 the design I already had in place - if I have objects that know how to 
serialize themselves to a database and get themselves back out, they 
should just know how to send themselves across the wire too. So, I'm 
working on a basic message-level protocol, something very simple, and 
will use that to enable the objects to send messages to their clones on 
other nodes. Should work pretty well and with a lot *less* code oddly 
enough than if I was trying to use GNet objects to shoehorn the data in 
there. Also, only 32 slots? Really? That just doesn't seem like enough 
for what I'm doing.<br><br>So there you have it. I wonder if I'll even actually put up a screen shot or demo of the stuff I work on here... we'll see... <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>7/7</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2008-07-07)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Okay so this is what I've been working on - a Visual Basic clone for 
BlitzMax. I know, I know, it's crazy, but I really miss the days of 
simple VB6 and it's IDE that just did two things  - provide a GUI editor
 and a way to edit code.<br><br>Basically I have a component framework 
that currently uses MaxGUI but has the option to be ripped out and 
replaced with wxMax without any changes needed to application code 
written to use the components. Form descriptions are stored in FRM files
 that are compatible with VB6's output format (for the most part), with 
code provided in bmx files with matching names. For instance, say you 
have a form called frmMain with a button called cmdSayHello. To get the 
obligatory hello message to pop up, all you would need to write in the 
code is this (the incbin and type declaration will actually be generated
 automatically):<br><br><b>frmMain.bmx</b><br><pre class="code">Incbin "frmMain.frm"

Type TfrmMain Extends VMForm

  Method cmdSayHello_Click(Event:TEvent)
    Notify "Hello world!"
  EndMethod

EndType
</pre><br><br>Everything else - creation of the window, event handling, 
everything is taken care of for you. The FRM file itself might look like
 this, but remember in the final system you'll be using a GUI editor to 
create windows:<br><br><b>frmMain.frm</b><br><pre class="code">VERSION 5.00
Begin VMForm frmMain
  Caption = "Hello"
  ClientHeight = 150
  ClientWidth = 20
  ClientTop = 100
  ClientLeft = 100
  Begin VMCommandButton cmdSayHello
    Left = 10
    Top = 10
    Width = 100
    Height = 30
    Caption = "Say Hello"
  End
End
</pre><br><br>Finally a project file tells the framework to load this 
form automatically (again this file is generated for you when you create
 a new project):<br><br><b>hello.vmp</b><br><pre class="code">Type=exe
Form=frmMain.frm
Startup="frmMain"
Name = "Hello World"
</pre><br><br>All of this is currently working, what is left to me now 
is to port my form editor over to BlitzMax and create the project 
management functions. Then I'll have something to show!<br><br><b>Edit:</b><br>Ah
 I forgot to mention originally that this will be all integrated into 
Cobalt. You will optionally be able to provide functionality in the form
 of Cobalt scripts instead of BlitzMax code. I should also clarify that 
when you do use BlitzMax code to create the app logic and compile it - <b>all</b>
 extra files are Incbin'd (including binary packages for images, etc.) 
so that there is still a single EXE / .app for the entire application. 
If you use Cobalt there will be a mess of files, probably packaged in a 
ZIP so you will have two files (a stub EXE file and a ZIP of the Cobalt 
code / FRM resources). <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>6/26</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2007-06-26)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Got a bit more done on the console control. I think I'm spending too 
much time on it, but it's the easiest way to add a GUI to Cobalt at the 
moment without having to hook up events, etc. The GUI system I have in 
place is a bit complicated, but it has to be in order to support the 
kind of networked stuff I'm trying to do.<br><br>It'd be easier if I 
could just use Print/Input, but those would obviously block network I/O.
 Can't have that. It'd be very nice if BMax supported threading, but 
that isn't a discussion I want to get into right now.<br><br>It's slow 
going but I think I'm starting to get there. I wish I'd had more time in
 the past few weeks to work on it, but you can only do so much. 
Hopefully I can get a working example put together in a little while. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Mac</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2007-06-25)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 I recently purchased a MacBook, so I'll be evaluating if I want to go 
cross platform with this code base. I actually was pretty sure I wanted 
to transition this project to a different language, but on further 
reflection that seems like a bit of a waste.<br><br>I will start looking
 at it for Mac this evening and in the next few weeks. It would be 
really cool to get this stuff running so I have something to show off,

 decided to use Brucy's SQLite database module, the interpreter is my

can now create and save lists to the database through the GUI by 
entering commands, then get them back out of the DB file after

bit of code for a nicer console than what I was using (an output 
TextArea with a separate TextField for input). I really like this, but

 have a peer network based on BNetEx running, however it doesn't have 
any actual synchronization stuff in it yet. It's basically just a 
peer-to-peer message passing library at the moment, I'll be layering the
 DB synchronization on top of this as a next step. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Things to work on</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2007-04-23)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> A few things I want to work on:<br><br>Create an ActiveVB API Viewer plugin for BlitzMax: <a href="http://blitzmax.com/Community/posts.php?topic=68929" target="_blank">http://blitzmax.com/Community/posts.php?topic=68929</a><br><br>Look in to creating a console widget for BlitzMax: <a href="http://blitzmax.com/Community/posts.php?topic=68928" target="_blank">http://blitzmax.com/Community/posts.php?topic=68928</a><br><br>A

day" thing, and versioned story editing.<br><br>Also this interactive 
programming thing. I've been playing with SecondLife lately, it's 
inspired me and at the same time maybe toned me down. I mean, they 
already did it right? The difference is in the storage system, language 
syntax, platform, and focus. So what I'm doing is totally different, but
 at the same time in sort of the same spirit as their LSL stuff. I 
really dislike a few of their decisions (it's a procedural language in a
 3D world, what?), but it seems like a good system. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Database</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2007-04-19)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 If I do the integrated database stuff in any aspect, it probably won't

 Okay, on further reflection, I'm not sure that this is how I'm going to
 do this. I am still working on the interpreter stuff, but otherwise, 
I'm just not sure. The idea of actually using a unified development 
environment is nice but I'm not sure if I would really use it.<br><br>I 
think the problem is that I just need to actually come up with a use for
 this idea. Then I'd have the inspiration to actually create it.<br><br>Anyway, as far as the interpreter goes, I've got this working:<br><pre class="code">(bind 'Name' (input 'Enter your name:'))
(if Name
  (print 'Hello, ' Name))
</pre><br>Really not too hard.

 project is meant to satisfy or at least research the many frustrations I
 have with current work models that  force a user to come up with a 
third party solution or, worse, manually sync work between multiple 
workstations (multiple desktops, laptop, pdas, etc).<br><br>The goal of 
this stuff I'm doing is to make an environment where the changes you 
make are just there on the other machine by the time you get back to it.
 If you have an internet connection, all changes are streamed to the 
remote machine while you work. If you're offline while working, the 
changes are streamed to the remote machine when a connection is 
available.<br><br>The first part of this is a database system. I'm using a simple model based on <a href="http://web.archive.org/codearcs/codearcs.php?code=1981">Cheetah DB</a> for now that stores:<br><br>ObjectID - C,5<br>Data - M<br><br>The ObjectID is used to refer to this object, Data contains a compact binary representation of the data for the object.<br><br>To
 sync objects together, I am planning on using GNet by extending it's 
TGNetObject and TGNetHost classes. My extended TGNetHost will recover an
 object from the database if it already exists, and save objects back to
 the database periodically to save user's work.<br><br>I'm leaving out a lot of the details because I haven't finished designing the whole thing yet.<br><br>One
 huge part of it will be a dynamic scripting language that runs on top 
of all this to make it all transparent to the user. I'll get into that 
later. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
