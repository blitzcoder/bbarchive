 I hate lots of screen size. In the good old days, you would know how 
big the graphics view was going to be, cos it was hard wired in, 
nowadays however you have to cater to every man and his wide screen 256 
colour dog. <br>I thought Id start the Most fantastic and brilliantly 
implemented LOMPC editor by creating a map type. Simple. But thinks I, 
the map type needs at this stage a 2d view. (Ok so the final game 
doesn’t need a 2d view, but the mission editor does), so off I trot and 
knock one together. Works brilliantly (as is to be expected), well ok 
when I say brilliantly, I mean that it works in 800 by 600 with no 
problems. When I moved over to the laptop to continue…. Yes well ok so 
maybe I forgot to allow for mode changes properly. Oh Um.<br><br>On this point, why do I always have a global screenwidth, and a global screenHeight ?<br>I’m
 not even considering using widescreen so surly ScreenHeight = 
ScreenWidth * 0.75. It would make changing the screen dimensions whilst 
in development loads easier, (well ok so I would only have to change one
 value rather than two). Never do it though, always without fail, just 
after the strict and framework, Global screenwidth,screenHeight. <br><br>Development
 of  LOMPC Brill edition, was halted on Sunday, due to my nephew turning
 up, wanting yet another tutorial on FPS Creator, ( I bought it him for 
his 11th birthday). I say tutorial, but mostly in consists of me asking 
what fun the game is if the first room you go into has twenty Uber 
baddies in it, and you die straightaway. He thinks its fun anyway.<br><br>For
 everyone who hasn’t heard of FPS Creator, it’s from the dark basic 
people, it’s written in dark ( I think), and its crap. Oh I don’t mean 
that it doesn’t do what it says it does on the box, cos it does. Andy 
(My nephew), is not the brightest smarty in the box, but at 11 he can 
knock together a passable looking level of a game. What’s rubbish about 
it is its implementation, (or rather marketing). It’s basically an 
editor for a game they didn’t produce. Honestly, it looks like someone 
wrote an fps in dark, realised how crap it was, so just released the MOD
 creator. AND do they use standard md2 or 3ds models, (let me give you a
 clue, if they did you wouldn’t need to BUY extra models from them…..).<br><br>So
 all of Sunday spent waiting for FPS to display the minute change we 
made in the level. I would recommend that you get a demo of it to see, 
it might give you some ideas, and it is a good way to introduce kids to 
programming, it is a bit drop and go, but you do need to improve the 
scripts for everything.<br><br>PS Obviously If Blitz have a comparable piece of software, get that instead. <br><br> H&amp;K </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Statement of Intent</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-05-13)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> The Only One He Ever Finished.<br><br>I
 have been “messing” with computer programming since before I was bought
 a ZX Spectrum for Christmas (16K no less). When I would sit at the back
 of boring (i.e. Most) classes reading Listings in magazines. I would 
read the listing, and try to imagine what the finished program looked 
like. (I didn’t actually have a computer remember).<br>I would scribble 
down useful looking subroutines (I still think Go sub is a good idea), 
and change them to do other things. I would go to the shops and get 
their computers to do “pretty” things. I had been expecting a ZX81, so 
when for my birthday, (Well I say my Birthday, but it was a joint 
present for both my sister and I, and we didn’t get a Christmas present 
that year), I got a lovely new Spectrum I was overjoyed.<br>For those 
that remember the first spectrums didn’t come with any software, just a 
manual with some listings in it. One at least that I remember was a 
smash through the wall with a ball game, which was fun, but nearly as 
much fun was trying to figure out why it didn’t work properly, nearly 
always it was because of typing errors, which is hard to do (type wrong)
 when all the keywords are written on the keyboard and accessed by 
single Key presses. It was nearly always because of a variable mistyped,
 but it was fun to see what your program did, and try to get it to do 
what the listing said it would do.<br>My Imagination knew no bounds, 
space battle games, D&amp;D remakes, Lego simulators etc. Then games 
started to appear in the shops, and well, you know, a real finished game
 or one that would take ages and ages (I was only twelve) to finish. So 
programming went out the window. Oh Um.<br><br>Then I bought Lords of 
Midnight, which was a fantastic game. People talk about wolfenstien as 
the first “first person” game, (which I could never understand, as surly
 3D monster maze was sooner), but LOM was in 3D. Ok admittedly it wasn’t
 really. For those who cannot remember it, (its one of the fake loading 
screens in dawinia), a brief description. <br><br>LOM<br><br>The screen 
is split into three distinct parts, ( This was quite normal in spectrum 
games because each screen buffer (haha) was split into three, so that 
increasing the pointer to the screen by 256 (screenptr +256) would move 
you down on row of pixels, and by 32 (Screenptr +32) by a whole Char 
square, Then by 2048 (screenptr +2048) would move down a screen third. 
(This with the 768 Bytes needed for the colours) was the Spectrum 
screen. (Remember the spectrum only had 16K, so a 6912Byte screen was 
quite big). That’s why for anyone who was interested the spectrum 
loading screens loaded so strangely.<br>The Top of LOM was (If I can 
remember correctly) a shield of your current character and his name, and
 I think the time of day. The Middle Third was a 3d representation of 
the world in front of you, (you could see about eight map square to the 
front), with a sprite of the characters in the square to the front. And 
the bottom was of the people and or monsters who where in the square 
with you.<br>The games came with a nice Spectrum overlay that had all 
the commands in the game. You could look round (North, northwest etc), 
explore the square you were in, move forward Try to recruit the 
characters in that square, recruit more men (when in keeps or citadels) 
etc. Then when night fell, the baddies moved (Cos they are evil and only
 move at night), and battles happened. You would get rumours of fights 
in far-flung nations, dawn would break and you would have the chance to 
move again.<br>There were two ways to win, get Morkin, (Err Frodo) to 
get the ice crown to some pool or other thus destroying DoomDarks power.
 (Tip to all evil supermen DON’T put the main part of  your power into a
 piece of jewellery, no matter how cool it looks). Or take DoomDarks 
main citadel by force of arms. You could loose by Morkin dieing, and 
either Luxor (Arigorn) dieing or loosing your main city<br><br>Oh the 
heroics of the game, rushing the wizard, (whose real name I cannot 
remember so we will call Gandalf), north in the hope of recruiting the 
northern nations. Lord Blood holding the plains of blood for as long as 
he could just to buy time, finding the dragon (Farflax I think) with 
Morkin so that he had help. Oh what memories.<br><br>Well anyway after 
playing the game a million times, (yes I said a Million), I was at a 
friends house, when I casually commented that if we could load in the 
save game position, we could give ourselves more troops. Well that was 
it. The save game position was simply a normal spectrum save without the
 header file. (i.e. If you had a header of a file the same size, you 
could play it just before the save game, and the spectrum would load in 
the save position.<br>Now For some reason LOM saved the whole map????, 
not just the position of the armies etc. And the AI instructions for the
 armies. (Well OK a linked list of where to attack next). What it didn’t
 do, (which annoys me to this day), is save all the name data for the 
map, just the name data for the top quarter or so. But It was enough.<br>An editor was born.<br>You
 could change the strength of all 32 of your allies, you could change 
who could recruit who, change the graphic of the characters (ok only to a
 pre defined graphic), change where swords, water of dawn, wolfs, 
dragons, mountains, plains etc where. You could choose how many armies 
chased the secondary character (Frodo ,err sorry Morkin), What route the
 baddie armies took, the whole shooting match. Ok so you couldn’t name 
places, the plains of Blood stayed the plains of Blood, (Or the 
maintains of Blood, or the Keep of Blood, but always … of Blood), accept
 for the Northern third.<br><br>The game was reborn. Then Doomdarks 
revenge came out. And it wasn’t as good a game, as the ones being 
produced by my friends on my editor, so we kept plying them.<br><br>Finally
 at last the editor was finished, (It was written in basic, but compiled
 with HiSoft Spectrum Compiler). And It was sent off for publication and
 riches. BUT Mike Singleton had gone and sold ALL the rights to 
TelecomSoft. (I think he went bankrupt, but not sure). And I don’t think
 the men at telecom soft even looked at it. I just got a nice letter 
saying they didn’t sell this sort of thing, but thanking me for 
bothering them.<br><br>And that was it. Never finished a another single 
thing, (cept A stupid Four player tron game in AMOS, which I had bet my 
mate could be programmed in less than an hour). I Half wrote an 
underwater “Elite” style game, a PBM fantasy game, a star craft type 
thing an absolutely brilliant sequel to rebel star raiders, (Well Before
 Enemy Unknown, and just as good), Etc. All, in my opinion well 
presented, and adequately written, and more importantly very playable. 
Yet none of them finished L<br>SO, I am going to write LOM in BlitzMaz. 
It wont be better than LOM, it wont be quicker than LOM, (Its turn based
 doh). What it will be is a reason for people to use my bloody scenario 
editor.<br><br>Now I don’t want any rubbish about how badly this remake of LOM is, cos the editor is brilliant. <br><br> H&amp;K </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
