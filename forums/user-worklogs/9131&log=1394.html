 time you play you'll get a different civilization, whether it be 
humanoid, insect, alien, robot, giant ameoba, walking plant, ghost, 
reptile, or something else.  As well as having a random civ, you have a 
random tech tree, based on the world you encounter.  The point is, you 
must adapt to your conditions or face extiction.  Different resourses 
are on different planets, so you have figure out which ones you need and
 which to avoid.  There are hazardous substances on you planet.  But 
those materials may be vital to the survival of another race.<br><br>Research
 is not just "research this tech to upgrade that thing", you spend money
 on research in various areas, like; how to combine resources, how to 
improve a specific attribute (damage, hitpoints, stealth, etc.), how to 
resist damage from something, etc.  You might get lucky and get a result
 quickly, or you might be less fortunate and spend half the game trying 
to find a better way to harvest wood.  Of course, the more urgent 
something is - like say your enemy has guns in the stone age - the 
better your chances of getting quick results - like you rapidly develop 
bullet proof leather or something. <br><br> "Blessed are the geeks, for they shall internet the Earth" </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>GUI up and running</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-12-27)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 I developed a scalable GUI for Planet X.  It should appear pretty much 
the same on any screen or resolution.  Mouse functions included like 
clicking, double clicking, dragging, etc.  Menus and buttons still in 
progress. <br><br> "Blessed are the geeks, for they shall internet the Earth" </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Early work on gameplay basics</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-12-27)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 I have written and tested the code for telling a unit where to go.  
Although I have no pathfinding code yet, I do have the ship accelerate 
and decelerate properly.  It will even backup and turn around.  I fixed 
bugs where the ship would fly circles around the destination, where it 
would avoid the destination when it was pointed the wrong way, where it 
would fly in reverse, and where it would flip rapidly back and forth for
 a few seconds once it reached the destination.  But all that is fixed.<br><br>Now for waypoints.<br><br>Then on to the pathfinding routines. <br><br> "Blessed are the geeks, for they shall internet the Earth" </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Custom File Formats</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-11-26)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> For Planet X I'm working on creating my own image format - <u>RGBAP</u> (<b>R</b>ed, <b>G</b>reen, <b>B</b>lue, <b>A</b>lpha, <b>P</b>layer
 color).  The RGB information is combined with the player color 
depending on the value of P.  The alpha is clamped onto the resulting 
RGB to produce the RBGA of each pixel.  Another way of understanding 
what is going on is to use the P as alpha information, blend the texture
 with a flat texture of player color, then use the A value as the alpha 
of the resultant texture.<br>Some sort of compression will be used to store the 40bpp texture and an editor will be included with the custom mapmaker.<br><br>I
 may or may not make a custom model format.  What I mean is, that I may 
incorporate a X format mesh into a system where I can have particle 
emitters, shadows, sprites, and anything else that might be nice - like 
attachment points for things like weapons, armor, or special effects.<br><br>Further custom file formats - like maps, AI's, etc. may follow. <br><br> "Blessed are the geeks, for they shall internet the Earth" </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>The beginnings</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-11-04)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Way back a few years ago when I was using the demo version of BlitzBasic, I began work on a RTS (<b>r</b>eal-<b>t</b>ime <b>s</b>trategy
 game).  I got far enough into it to have all the objects in there.  I 
could tell my spaceships where to go.  I could select them in groups.  
The ships would autofire on enemies within range and mine from planets 
within range.  Ships could repair themselves and others.  Debry left 
from ships could be mined for small amounts of cash.<br><br>But, it was 
way too demanding on the processor.  And loading time was also 
rediculously long.  So I started over mostly from scratch, improving 
some of the systems I had developed for the original.  Then I bought 
Blitz3D.  Now I'm working (slowly) on rewriting an improved, 3D version.<br><br>(Sorry, no screen shots)<br><br>If
 anybody is interested in the original, poorly made version, email me (I
 don't check my email very often, so it might be a week or two before I 
send the code to you).  You may use any of the ideas/graphics contained 
therein.  Just be aware that not all the code is well-written. <br><br> "Blessed are the geeks, for they shall internet the Earth" </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
