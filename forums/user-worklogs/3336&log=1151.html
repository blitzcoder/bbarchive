 I just finished preliminaries for the game, ive done some of game

for medium and large sized monsters, they would be real 3d models, but 
ill have to see how well they go together.<br>---<br>Friday 7/11<br>Added:
 Created the Melee level 6 unit, and the Air level 6 unit also, from 
that i will start to downgrade the poly count and detail and size to 
create the other lower levels, ive decided to do this so that it will be
 alot easier to create the 28 units that i need to do. The starting 
levels will have mass amount of units, and as the level progress, there 
will be less units, but they will be more detailed.<br>Added: A*

 My computer is going *coocoo* whenever i press the CTRL or f5 or number
 3, it keeps opening windows programs, as if it was binded to a 
shortcut, i initially thought that it was a virus, but no anti-virus 
program has been able to find anything, ill have to reinstall Windows or
 something, cause its really hard to program without being able to do 
fast copy and paste, and play any kind of game like this.<br>---<br>Monday 6/30<br>Note: Im gonna add the single surface system today...<br>Modified:
 Changed the stun system, now the animation is dependent on the amount 
of stun strength this gives the nice arcade feeling i was looking for. 
Also resolved some balancing issues, where the user could just always 
repeatedly press the punch and the other user could just not do anything
 until he's dead.<br>Note: Im currently thinking of implementing 
realtime clouds :D, using Perlin noise algorithm, im not sure how slow 
it might go, but it would be a nice learning experience. Im also going 
to try my hands on real time radiosity! I know... sounds pretty crazy 
idea LOL, but again it would be a nice learning experience.<br>modified: Single Particle system, ive finished implementing camerafacing.<br>---<br>Tuesday 7/1<br>Note:
 Good news, Im getting more help on the programming side ^_^, this means
 ill be able to concentrate more on graphical aspect of the game which i
 like the most :D<br>Note: I just tried perlin noise algorithm, it so 
SLOW! So I'm gonna use another method. Radiosity is extremely slow also,
 unless having those new GeForceFX video card, realtime radiosity is way
 way not a good idea, so im not gonna do radiosity in realtime anytime 
soon, but i will try my hands for pre-rendered.<br>If your canadian; HAPPY CANADA DAY :P<br>Added:
 Single Surface particle engine in to the fighting game, its very 
steady, going around 230 fps with 1000 particles with everything else 
going on. The only thing i dont like is that since its a single entity, 
its not affected by Blitz's tweenining, so everything else looks smooth,
 but the particle is abit choppy :/ compared to the other stuffs. I 
guess ill implement single surface particles only for slow stuffs, and 
ill use the normal sprite system for particle that go faster.<br>---<br>Wednesday 7/2<br>Note: Ok, im formating my computer 1 right now... I hope i backed up everything essential... *gulp*<br>While I reinstall everything, im writing down all the concept changes ive done the last hours or so...<br>1.
 I finnaly have a story, inspired by some B movie, which I seem to have 
forgotten the name... but anyways, its a world where women rule, and 
male do not exist anymore, except for 1 (ta ta tummmmmmm!), *cough* yes i
 know, not  very original but meh... I wrote more on it, but I dont 
wanna write it all here, but all womens are a clone from the last 
surviving women, ect... youll know the story once i finish the game.<br>2. Ive balanced and changed some concepts for each arenas, i have finish thinking it through yet, but heres an outline:<br>Arena 1 -&gt; Interior, use of very soft shadow<br>Arena 2 -&gt; Island Paradise, remove rain cycle, this will balance out performance issues with the other arena<br>Arena 3 -&gt; Montreal, rainy environment, with splash and very soft shadows<br>Arena 4 -&gt; Snow Base, Mass snow, deformable snow<br>Arena 5 -&gt; Demon World, Rain of fire<br>3.
 Ive also started to run through the concept and pseudo code for 
critical hit display, deformable snow and super attacks (melee), there 
will be 2 or 3 super attacks per character, they are predefined 
animation combos that uses mana, the damage is proportionaly exponent to
 the number of attacks. Ill get more on it once installation is done.<br>---<br>Thursday 7/3<br>Note:
 After reinstalling windows, the problem still occurs, so it was the 
keyboard after all XD, i just replaced it and it works now, i shoulve 
tried replacing keyboards first :/<br>---<br>Sunday 7/6<br>Note: Bad

 very much later, not gonna do much coding this week.<br>Note: Ive just 
made up my mind about the last boss in single player, the character will
 not be selectable to the user, this will allow me to really pump and 
put incredible stuff to him, i was thinking of a robe that when he

 The game is progressing slowly right now, this is the 3rd Month and 
summer coming, I might have to extend the deadline, but Im not sure yet,
 ill have to see how it goes. But the good news is that ill have more 
time to do concept arts, the next arena is situated in the city of 
Montreal(thats where I live) on top of a high building, ill need to take
 some shots with a camera and model the city. Im also thinking of the 
day time to be sunset time, yet im not sure jsut yet. So around the 
buildings are many more buildings, some mountains, a river, i might put 
some cars traveling and stuff. But I have a good instinct about this

man.... that thing can display a huge number of particle, its running at
 360-440 fps with 10 000 particles on computer 1, im gonna have to 
implement auto Camera facing and put it in the game, its gonna be so 
cool to be able to use so many particle ^^<br>---<br>Thursday 6/12<br>Modified:
 I did some work on the particle system today, it can now Life fade, 
life scale and turn, next step is to optimize the turning algorithm and

 I just had a really nice idea to add to the game, the user will be able
 to have special abilities that can be activated through special combos,
 and in single player, the user can upgrade his/her character. Ex: 
Vampiric Attack, Stunning, ect...<br>Also, as the user gets more damaged, the more armor he/she will have, this will make the fights longer and more exciting.<br>Note: Linus is also taking a shot at Level Texturing and Concept.<br>Note: Started the third Female Character<br>---<br>Thursday 5/29<br>Modified: Second Female character; jogging type female, blond, white shirt, Finished Rigging.. i wish i had Weighted bones :S<br>Modified: Third Female character; Necro-type female, very dark colors, red-head / brunette.<br>Added:
 Island Paradise Arena, if youve seen the demo, youll know what i mean, 
of course ill have to change ALOT in it, ill make less trees but much 
cooler looking trees and leaves swaying, grass, pollens, rain, night, 
waves, this map is near-last arena in the single player, the last arena 
is the Twisted version (demon world) of Island Paradise which will have 
rain of fire, magma, ect...<br>---<br>Friday 5/30<br>Modified: Island 
Paradise Arena, solved many bugs, ive decided to not have 300 trees, as 
it doesnt look as good as i had hoped, instead im going to put 3 huge 
trees with lotsa leaves swaying. Also added dripplet effects when it 
rains, eats alot of FPS but the user can enable it or disable it.<br>Note:
 I just found an even easier way to export the 2nd UV coordinates, this 
will really speed up level designs and make them look as i wanted in the
 first place.<br>---<br>Saturday 5/31<br>Modified: Island paradise 
level, itll be called something else soon, i made it so that theres a 
spotlight with fog to be added when its at night, also added 3 huge 
trees, im pondering on if I should put the old leaves or use a hack to 
do it and get speed boost... ill also need camera collision detection 
since the camera gets in the tree at times...<br>---<br>Sunday 6/1<br>Modified:

 Because of time constraints, and the fact that im doing pretty much

 And so another week starts, blitzcoder being up again. Not much else to
 say, its been raining the few days, and its gonna rain *again* for the 
next days, pretty much of a downer there. I guess i forgot to mention my
 team mates so here they are by order of recruit:<br>Main Coder/Artist: Hau Nghiep Phan (TigerZ, thats me BTW)<br>Music: Jack (forgot his family name)<br>Support Coder: Linus Levis<br>Story: Gary Rennie (CrazyGaz)<br>we
 all live in Canada, Montreal, except for Gary who lives in the US. I 
met Jack when I told one of my friends that I needed a musician for my 
games, so he refered him to me. Linus was a collegue of mine while i was
 working for, please dont laugh, Saine Marketing, he went to the same 
college as me, Dawson College, and went to the same program as me, 
Computer Science, but we didnt go in the same year, he went 2 years 
before me. And Gary is a fellow member of BlitzCoder, he's 15 i think, 
and thats a good thing for story writing, since his imagination is 
pretty much hyped up at that age.<br>Linus is gonna code the GUI, the Camera Control, the AI for now and I do pretty much everything else.<br>---<br>Monday 5/12<br>Note: I talked to Gary Rennie, and the first 3 races of the 5 races have been set out;<br>Race 1: Human (2 model almost done)<br>Race 2: Cybernetically enhanced human<br>Race 3: Half-Demon<br>Race 4: ?<br>Race 5: ? (only 1 character)<br>Theres time to figure out what the other 2 races will be, so im not too worried.<br>Modified: Human Male Character; I just finished its UV mapping, the hair was particularly annoying to do.<br>---<br>Tuesday 5/13<br>Modified: Human Male Character; Finished step 1 of texturing, Finished step 2 of texturing. Started rigging of the model.<br>Note:
 I just realized that Im gonna be behind schedule, ill need to create 
the arenas, and itll take 1 week for each arena also. So after i finish 
creating this model, ill have to create the first arena, which would be 
on Planet earth, in the clouds. Im thinking of having 5 arenas or maybe 
more, depending on the time constraints.<br>Modified: Human Male Character; Finished step 3 of texturing. Partially done Step 4 of texturing.<br>Here is the result:<br>http://invis.free.anonymizer.com/http://cgi0081.tripod.com/Human_Male_character2.jpg<br>Again
 its not finished until a story is written, ill add tatoos and finish up
 his face at that point. Ill also need to put specular(shininess) and 
finish up the rigging tomorrow. Now i need to start to create the first 
arena.<br>Note: Ill need to make the skin of the male character have 
more depth. For the first Arena, im thinking of a floating Arena, above 
the clouds, around the Arena, are ruins of Roman/Greque temples, with 
birds flying above. The man model is also bigger then the female one, 
which will have a wider collision radius, but he will have more strength
 to conpensate. Where as the female one will have more endurance and 
Mana perhaps. I've also scraped the idea of the male being mean looking 
and all, the cybernetically enhanced character will though.<br>---<br>Wednesday 5/14<br>Note:
 Arena 1; I just had an idea, the arena itself will be a replica of the 
Roman Colloseum that floats above the clouds. Well its raining AGAIN 
today, I dunno why but Im gonna put a level where its gonna rain alot, 
with alot of wind going on, thunder, cloudy skies... very..... noire...<br>Added:
 Arena 1; earth Arena, I just started the modeling for the first Arena. 
Im expecting around 9-10k polygons, but i dunno exactly yet, it will be 
very big though (size, not poly). Just tried to see how slow itll get 
once i put 10k on the scene, and... oh yeah... very good FPS ;)<br>Modified:
 Arena 1; earth Arena, I modeled it more and added UV mapping, the next 
step is to add details, and put aging effects. Polycount = 5880<br>---<br>Thursday 5/15<br>Note: Finally a beautiful day outside, yay, this will definetly help me out in arena design.<br>Modified: Arena 1; earth Arena, Im trying out different Light setups to see which one would look best for the game.<br>Modified:
 Arena 1; earth Arena, I just did another try with lightmaps, this time 
its a sunset, looks very sweet now ^^. And its time to make the arena 
old, and put textures.... right now the texture size is abit 
excessive... 2048x2048 -_-'   ill remedy it once i finish making it look
 old and stuffs. Im looking at the female character and the male 
character, i really need to redraw the female's cloth, doesnt look good.<br>OK, so heres the LightMap for the first arena, its not finished, but ull get the sense of what i mean.<br>**Took out: http://invis.free.anonymizer.com/http://cgi0081.tripod.com/Arena_Earth_1.jpg***<br>---<br>Friday 5/16<br>Modified:
 Arena 1; earth Arena, I just sliced up the Light map, and its now 5 
texture file instead of one huge texture. Ive also put soft shadow 
instead of that stencil looking shadow. Next Step, erosion of the 
coloseum... Ill be adding Drop Fog effect in the game for this arena.<br>Modified: Arena 1; earth Arena, setup for the the lightmap is now completed and final and the ingame works perfectly.<br>Modified:
 Arena 1; earth Arena, Remodeled the spectator's seats, better light map
 quality. Tested out destruction of the colosseum, doesnt look very 
good... ill have to find a way to export 2 uv map coordonates into 1 
model to use in B3D.<br>---<br>Saturday 5/17<br>Note: Well after a 
couple of hours on fondling on how to use the 2nd UV map for light 
mapping, i finnaly found a way to do it ^^ hooooray! Now i can finish up
 the first arena. Just tested it ingame, works perfectly, except that 
theres abit of a frame loss, not much though.<br>---<br>Sunday 5/18<br>Added: Arena 1; earth Arena, Volume Fog.<br>Modified:
 Human Male Character; Finished Rigging, tested the character in the 
game, works, but doesnt look as good as i thought, ill have to tweak it.<br>Modified:
 User can now choose which character he wants to fight, the female is 1 
head smaller then the male, the height difference will impact the way 
each user is played, since hitting the head does more damage then the 
torso.<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>3DFight_Week_7</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2003-05-05)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 The next 7-8 weeks will be concentrated on model creation as well as 
level design. And since in Canada, the temperature is really rising, ill
 spend most of my time running or biking outside, and enjoying the

 level design.<br>FPS Reference at 640x480 32 bit on Wednesday:<br>High: 322<br>Average: 280<br>Low: 186<br>Reference FPS taken on Computer 1<br>---<br>Monday 5/5<br>Modified: Human Female Character; Finished UV mapping.

 Human Female Character; Finished step 2 of texturing. Finished step 3 
of texturing. Step 4 of texturing partially completed. Finished rigging 
to bone. I was able to export the model into B3D and make it fight, it 
works, but since B3D doesnt have bone blending, it doesnt look as nice 
as i wanted it to be, ill have to tweak it to make it look better.<br>---<br>Wednesday 5/7<br>Modified:
 Human Female Character; the rigging is much better now, i made a 
mistake when i was exporting the mesh into B3D format the other day, its
 now solved.<br>Modified: Improved ingame visuals.<br>At step 3, this is the result.<br>http://invis.free.anonymizer.com/http://cgi0081.tripod.com/Human_Female_character3.jpg<br>the
 screenshots im posting are, of course, not pre-rendered images, but 
rather real time rendering, i retouched it to show the wireframe though.<br>The
 last step (step 4) will be finished once i get a story, since the 4th 
step of texturing is about adding details (ie: tatoos, armor, ect...) 
and so tomorrow, ill be starting the Human Male character.<br>---<br>Thursday 5/8<br>Note:
 Ive been thinking of how the first human male should look like, im 
thinking of muscular type, with boxers and a belt-like around his waist 
with black tatoos on his body, a dragon perhaps or some other sign. A 
very primitive glove wrapping around his hands and arms, with metal 
knockers, looks mean or something with perhaps cyber enhancements on his
 arms or legs.<br>Added: Human Male Character; I just started modeling 
the guy, he is muscular, has pants, big arms. Body + head - hands - neck
 = 1282 polygons<br>---<br>Saturday 5/10<br>Modified: Human Male 
Character; Modelled the details on the character, his upper body is 
naked (will definetly get black tatoos) and wears pants, Whole Body = 
1648 polygons. Later on ill give him some hair, and very baggy cloths. 
Note: Right now im thinking that his upper body wont be totaly naked, 
but rather a cloth that will cover his arm and chest, with an opening on
 the middle of the chest...<br>---<br>Sunday 5/11<br>Modified: Human 
Male Character; Ive put some Hair, the hair looks abit like dragonBall 
style, but not the same, ive added hands and boots. Whole body = 1896, 
the cloth is very basic, ive decided to go with a naked upper body, and 
pants.<br>Modified: Human Male Character; Division of the body and cloth, ill have to remodel the arm, currently it looks too big.<br>Modified:
 Human Male Character; I just remodeled the arm, and ive done some few 
optimizations, the model is now final and ready for UV mapping. 
Polycount = 1728, I havent put smoothing groups on it yet, but itll be 
done once i get on the texturing part.<br>Heres a very early screenshot:<br>***Took Out: http://invis.free.anonymizer.com/http://cgi0081.tripod.com/Human_Male_character.jpg***<br>Ill
 start UV mapping and texturing tomorrow, now i know that theres a big 
difference between the polycount on the woman and the male, but it wont 
matter all that much, the FPS difference is very small, and the male 
character will have his pants interact with the cloth engine, but im not
 sure yet if im gonna do that. I forgot to put gloves on him &gt;_&lt; 
so I just updated the model...<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>3DFight_Week_6</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2003-04-28)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Ive been mostly tired the past few days, so ill need to get some major rest.<br><br>---<br>Monday 4/28<br>Modified:

 have it host my files, but thats in a few months away.<br>---<br>Wednesday 4/30<br>Modified:
 Cloth Engine, I can now simply call CreateCloth() to create 5x5 or 
10x10 detail cloth, I think that those 2 dimensions will be enough for 
my game, i can also have multiple cloth objects created.<br>Modified: 
Cloth are now created proceduraly instead of loading from a file, the 
interconnections are still hard coded, since i dont intend of changing 
them.<br>Note: Im running abit late, since LL hasnt finished the camera 
works, and I have till today to finish the cloth engine and have it 
implemented in the 3d Fight, my guess is that the scaling will be 
annoying to do.<br>Added: The cloth is now integrated in the 3D fight 
game, theres some tweaks that i'll need to do, but nothing major i 
think. Each model can have up to 10 cloth objects, with a detail of 
10x10 each, ill need to create a 3x3 cloth model now, since 5x5 is abit 
large for some other stuff im planning, once i finish the first female 
character, i will implement pony tail physiques as well as breast 
physique. Ill need to put wind also.<br>Added: 3x3 Cloth template<br>---<br>Thursday 5/1<br>Note:
 I have now started character design, my favorite model; Female human 
character ^_^, i'm planning on having one character created each week, 
for a total of 10 characters, the hidden character and the template 
character will be done at the end. Once I finish the models, i will 
probably put theyr screenshots here. I estimate around 3-4k polygons for
 each characters.<br>Created: Female Human Character; whole body, except face = 1516 polygons<br>---<br>Friday 5/2<br>Note:
 Ill have to modify her breasts, they look too big right now, im not 
sure yet about how her face should look, the hair color is also another 
issue... blond? brunette? or redHead?<br>Modified: Female Human 
Character; whole body + head = 1780, since its easier to modify from 
blond to brunette or redhead, ill start with blond, and ill see how it 
looks brunette and redhead later on. The modelling part is almost

 Im really starting to wonder if the cloth physique is really worth 
it... Im stil gonna implement it, but with the performance hit that it 
seems to put, I might rethink. The Next month(May) will be mainly

out animations, collisions, ect... Im also planning on starting GUI

code and put it in the tutorial, hopefully, itll help people understand 
better. Once BlizCoder.com is running up again, ill contact Krylar and 
have it permanently posted on the articles/tutorial board.<br>Modified: took out the annoying crouch bug as well as the strafe bug<br>Added: Straf Back animation, better Straf Front animation<br>Added: Flash on the head, when the user gets headbutt<br>Added: Create dust when the user falls down on the ground<br>---<br>Thursday 4/24<br>Modified: squashed that annoying cornering collision bug<br>Added: Better Arena Collision with particles and player<br>Modified:
 Took out another bug, when your hit or down on the ground, you cant do 
special attacks anymore, took out also the bug when you get hit by a 
laser stream, you cant block in mid time when being hit by it.<br>Modified:
 Ouf! after a 45 minutes of recoding, i finally finished changing the 
user player code so its much easier to code, update and read.<br>---<br>Friday 4/25<br>Note:
 I just ran some code on Rigid body, and at first glance, man this thing
 can really go fast! for now its actually running at 900 frame per 
second!!!!! and thats for 8 nodes, i dunno yet how slow itll go when 
were gonna implement it as cloth (around 100-200 nodes), but im crossing
 my finger on this, I really hope it'll be really fast enough with the 
collisions and wind going on.<br>Added: Cloth! Its soooo fast! right 
now, theres 100 particles, with 171 interconnections, with gravity, 
springs and its going at 570 frame per second. All i need to do now is 
to make collisions detection<br>Modified: I have now put collisions and 
did some optimizations and added shadow mapping, at fullscreen 800x600 
32 bit, its running at 950 frames per seconds!!!<br>Note: Im waiting to see how fast the cloth system is running on others computer the topic is here:<br><a href="http://www.blitzbasic.co.nz/bbs/posts.php?topic=20465" target="_blank">http://www.blitzbasic.co.nz/bbs/posts.php?topic=20465</a><br>screenshot of the cloth engine:<br>***Took Out: http://invis.free.anonymizer.com/http://cgi0081.tripod.com/good.jpg***<br>it was taken from computer 2<br>---<br>Saturday 4/26<br>Note:
 There seems to be some problem with the cloth on ATI Radeon Video Card,
 ill have to have check it out more thouroughly and hopefully solve the 
problem.<br>Note: I had a talk with 'Crazy Gaz' (I forgot his real name)
 yesterday, and he's gonna be doing the story he seems to have a very 
good imagination. I havent been able to contact my musician for sometime
 now, his cell phone doesnt seem to be active for sometime.<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>3DFight_Week_4</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2003-04-14)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Ive gone over some game design, my other team member is progressing 
fine *I think*. I have around 2 more weeks until the main code deadline,
 I'm pretty confident that i'll finish it by then. This week, I will 
undoubtfully have a story *I hope* done, so i can start planning other 
stuffs. And on the end of the month, once the main engine is done, I 
will start posting screenshots of what we have done so far. By then the 
cloth physique should be ready as well as smooth camera control.<br>here are the Special attacks, for now:<br><br>Level 3 <br>;Laser Stream <br>;Blizzard <br>;Comet <br>;Obliteration <br>;Glacial Swarm <br>;Elemental Morph <br>;Invincibility<br>;Apocalypse<br><br>;Level 2 <br>;FireBall Swarm <br>;Piercing Ice <br>;Glacial Arc <br>;Shakira Swarm <br>;Bomb Swarm <br>;Rays <br>;Infernal <br>;Hand of Apocalypse<br><br>;Level 1 <br>;ChargeBall <br>;FireBall <br>;ShockWave <br>;Shakira <br>;Bomb <br>;Swirling Blade <br>;Double Neutron <br>;Double Ball<br><br>---<br>Monday 4/14<br>added: Player to Arena delimiter collision<br>added:
 Lightmap compatible arena, this will be done from an outside program 
since im modeling the arena, instead of using maplet or anything like 
that. Ill have to check some stuffs for multiple UV mapping on a single 
mesh in B3D since i have realtime shadow maps and pre calculated 
radiosity lightmaps. Of course if its too trouble some, ill just use 
Maplet instead.<br>---<br>Tuesday 4/15<br>added: Flash Kick animation<br>added: 'Homeworld' like trails for strong legs hits<br>added: Crouched Guard<br>LL added: Camera Zoom control<br>modified: Laser Stream Special attack, better looking<br>---<br>Wednesday 4/16<br>added: Jump Front Kick<br>added: Crouch Guard<br>modified: Better Tripping attack detection<br>modified:
 When you fall down, you dont just suddenly 'get hit animated' anymore 
and come back on your feet extremely fast as it used to<br>modified: You
 can now charge up melee attacks by pumping normal attack and doing jump
 and/or Crouch attacks right after, but only works for kicks. But by 
doing this, you can create new never before seen moves, such as: 
escelating the ennemy and face kick, or double spinning kicks and will 
allow other advanced combos<br>the basic melee attack system is almost finished<br>---<br>Thursday 4/17<br>modified: solved some Player to Player collision bug<br>added: more precise Player collision<br>added: Particles Shadow<br>added: multiple types of Smoke Trails<br>---<br>Friday 4/18<br>modified: Recharge mana, better looking effects<br>modified: Laser Stream, bigger effects<br>added: Trails for ChargeBall<br>---<br>Saturday 4/19<br>LL modified: Smooth Camera, it now zooms correctly and smooths correctly<br>note:
 in the few weeks that follow, i will change completely the collision 
system, as the one that im using now isnt precise enough, i will use a 
more precise procedure, hopefully, i wont regret it...<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>3DFight_Week_3</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2003-04-07)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Meh.. not much to say, we still havent gotten a story yet, but im 
planning on having one by the end of this month, so i can start some 
character design and Arena designs. For now There will be 10 characters 
to chose from, 4 female, 4 male, 1 hidden character, 1 template 
character so that the user can customize him.<br>FPS reference:  <br>High: 501 at 640x480 on Wednesday<br>average: 300<br>Low: 220<br>---<br>Monday 4/7<br>added: Arena objects<br>added: swaying leafs on trees for Sakura Level with shadow mapping<br>added: clouds<br>---<br>Tuesday 4/8<br>modified: Clouds setup, repositioned and optimized the trees<br>expect a screenshot very soon ;)<br>modified: Kicks, better animation kicks<br>added: tripping attacks<br>---<br>Wednesday 4/9<br>added: Combination Special attacks system<br>added: Fireball special attack, Trails, Explosions<br>added: Homing FireBall Special Attack<br>added: Mana system<br>---<br>Thursday 4/10<br>added: Laser Stream Special Attack<br>---<br>Friday 4/11<br>added: Charging Ball Special attack<br>---<br>Saturday 4/12<br>modified: *cleaned* the collision detection for special attacks so it can be use easier<br>---<br>Sunday 4/13<br>modified:
 Custom Special attack for different Character, this will allow user to 
customize his own character with his favorite Special attacks and User 
model, the user will be able to texture a template character and use it 
to fight on his local machine.<br>preadded: all 24 Special attacks so i 
can make that the main code works, 4 special attacks have already been 
done, only 20 more to go... Later on ill put 8 to 16 Special moves 
combos attack.<br>added: Powering up Mana (like Dragon Ball)<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>3DFight_Week_2</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2003-03-30)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> After thoughtful thinking, ive come to the conclusion that this project will be finished on the last day of September.<br>---<br>Monday 3/31<br>I
