 make better dungeons - perhaps check next row as well as middle row 
when placing - yes definitely...check above and below...(next row on 
either side)<br><br>24. make lightmap / shaded area around player...low res image overlay with alpha<br><br>25.
 once better dungeon generation done create doors appropriately in right
 spots (near entrances to rooms)..potentially doors are never locked 
they are just closed at first hence no keys needed.<br><br>26. have fireball trigger explosive burst upon 'life end' of emitter<br><br>27. enable secret/hidden locations (mostly done) (add to level generation - simply close off some cells)<br><br>28. develop character progression system - not sure yet...need to design.<br><br>perhaps simply add 5-10% to stats on linear xp progression (or less %)<br><br>29.
 if design character progression system need to make it one of those 
'just a little bit further' designs to cause player to continue just a 
little bit further<br><br>30. have lightning chain itself across 
creatures...so hits one then randomly chooses another to hit up to 'n' 
(variable depending on level of spell) times during its lifetime within 
visibility and range<br><br>31. develop teleport spell - random location teleport to within dungeon...limited range...increased range more powerful<br><br>32. increase mana recharge rate<br><br>33. change mana bar colour to aqua/cyan not dark blue<br><br>34. change attackdelay bar to orange<br><br>35. have background hand drawn on main screen along borders/sides...make sure text is okay still<br><br>36. adjust GameCore.items.desc generator based on numeric stats<br><br>37. yeah remove keys.<br><br>38. limit shields to 1 active at a time<br><br>39. display particle effect when spell active (activedelay&gt;0)<br><br>40. get sound effects set when hits/swooshes occur appropriately.<br><br>41. include critical chance and critical factor in attack function<br><br>42.
 have global shake value GameCore.shakex, GameCore.shakey which is 
applied to draw functions to shake environment when critical occurs 
(often - 20% of deaths are criticals) (set to 'rand(n)-n/2' and reduce 
each frame to 0)<br><br>43. that's enough for now...think of more later.. <br><br> <a href="http://mattiesgames.com/" target="_blank"><img src="3317&amp;log=1918_files/banner2a.jpg"></a><br><a href="http://www.concavetales.com/weird.php" target="_blank">Markov Chain Text</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>fantasy game 2</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">2016-07-29</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> I've got a few ideas for my next game.  I stopped work on the fantasy game I was building for a few reasons.<br><br>My
 game Star Dancer has kept me entertained for over 18 months.  That's a 
long time to be entertained by one game, especially a mobile game.<br><br>It had mostly good reviews.. rating 4.4 on average.<br><br>I want to make something which holds my interest for a similar time.<br><br>Because google has stuffed my ad account I'll instead use an in app purchase to upgrade to the full version..one off payment.<br><br>It will be a mobile rpg from first person perspective with hand drawn static backgrounds and characters. <br><br>The design is mostly done.<br><br>The code is about 15% done.<br><br>The graphics 0% done.<br><br>It will be purely offline.<br><br>It will have a story.<br><br>The
 basic interface has 4 character portaits on the right and a main window
 where movement, combat, shopping and dialog takes place.<br><br>It will be effectively turn based.  Combat will be heavily based on inventory decisions and spell decisions.<br><br>The coding is relatively easy but there is a fair amount to do.  Quite a bit actually.<br>Then all the drawings. <br>I'd say it is about 70 30 split in terms of graphics code respectively.  I include story in that graphics split.<br><br>The actual game engine I'm building for it is quite simple in design and should allow for a lot of nice features.<br><br>There
 will be limited scripting.  The flow of the story will be linear and 
exploratory.  It will not have branches and so on but rather the player 
will find things out. Dialog is more informational than tree like.  <br><br>The
 game objective will primarily be about collecting powerful magic items 
and combining them in interesting ways to be very powerful.<br><br>It will in that sense be more about character statistical development than character story development. <br><br> <a href="http://mattiesgames.com/" target="_blank"><img src="3317&amp;log=1918_files/banner2a.jpg"></a><br><a href="http://www.concavetales.com/weird.php" target="_blank">Markov Chain Text</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Still waiting for artist--but</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">2016-07-17</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> I've started taking art classes. I'm a beginner but my drawings are quite okay.<br><br>I'm
 planning my next game already as this one is currently just waiting for
 the artist to finish the graphics. Then I'll release.<br><br>I'm 
thinking I'm wasting a bit of money on this...I'd probably be better off
 not doing it but it's too late now - I've already contracted the artist
 and I'm very happy with her work so far....it's just a bit sad that 
there will be no income from this game.<br><br>Google's admob login has 
stopped working for me. Not sure why. And I have no way of contacting 
them. So my only source of revenue for the game which was going to be 
advertising has dried up. It's not the sort of game that I'd spend money
 on IAPs - i don't like them - so I'd planned on having advertising 
throughout it. <br><br>The problem is something to do with my AdSense 
account...but I can't work out what....I've not had any bad activity on 
the accounts but google has simply shut it down without giving me a 
reason and then when I reopened it it won't connect to admob meaning I 
can't put ads in my game.<br><br>I could use a different provider but I 
don't want full screen ads which is what most of them do..I wanted a 
single banner ad at the bottom of the screen for most of the time...oh 
well....them's the breaks I suppose.<br><br>Anyway on to my next game idea. <br><br> <a href="http://mattiesgames.com/" target="_blank"><img src="3317&amp;log=1918_files/banner2a.jpg"></a><br><a href="http://www.concavetales.com/weird.php" target="_blank">Markov Chain Text</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>basic metrics built and ready to capture</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">2016-06-30</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> <img src="3317&amp;log=1918_files/metrics.jpg"><br><br>Mainly waiting for artist now...... <br><br> <a href="http://mattiesgames.com/" target="_blank"><img src="3317&amp;log=1918_files/banner2a.jpg"></a><br><a href="http://www.concavetales.com/weird.php" target="_blank">Markov Chain Text</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>More to do</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">2016-06-29</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> To do on fantasy game:<br><br>1.

 is an art heavy part - the territories on the map will have 3 visual 
appearances: Neutral, Good and Evil.  think lots of skulls and gothic 
scenes for the evil territories, Bavarian castles (Disney) for the good 
and peaceful hamlets for the neutral.<br><br>Before going to battle the screens you see here will come up....<br><br>They
 will allow the user to swap out their current units with purchased 
units (gold comes from battle victories). Units have stats and 
abilities.<br><br>Battle: Turn based alternate unit activation. Each 
unit chooses 1 option from 2 available per unit on a unit by unit basis 
(ie spells/attacks/defenses etc) - until one or the other side is dead 
(units revive after combat).<br><br>If win gain a territory, if lose lose a territory. For each enemy killed gain 'x' gold to spend on units.<br><br>Game
 is single player - no multiplayer component - I've learned since my 
last game that although people like multiplayer it is impossible for me 
to gain a community to play my games that would be needed for 
multiplayer to make sense.  <br><br>It will have no ads and zero 
monetisation strategy. The game is purely a game for the sake of playing
 a game.  I am willing to forego the potential to earn $10 over the 
course of a year and instead focus on a good game.<br><br>I haven't yet decided if there will be a secondary resource and whether this will be related to the territories on the map.<br><br>Varying Difficulty will be implemented by simply adjusting the winning gold totals for AI opponents.<br><br>Here
 are a couple of early ui screenshots from the unit choice 
screen...gives you an idea of how it will hang together (maybe...if you 
can visualise this sort of thing) <br><br> <a href="http://mattiesgames.com/" target="_blank"><img src="3317&amp;log=1918_files/banner2a.jpg"></a><br><a href="http://www.concavetales.com/weird.php" target="_blank">Markov Chain Text</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Fantasy Tactical Wargame</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">2016-06-24</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Okay...I've started work on a new game.
