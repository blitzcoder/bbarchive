 The production of "The Fairy Tale" is entering its final stage, as I 
have more projects I hope I can release it before next year, but that's 
hard to say... Anyway, I'm sure that I can finish the story soon, so I 
can start on testing and buxfixing and softening the sharp ends soon... 
Soon I'll release the user's guide, if some people want to read it and 
not all typo's and grammar errors I made in there, I would be 
grateful... I'll be even more gratefull if you speak a language that I 
don't (that's any language except for English and Dutch), you make a 
translation of that documentation. I'll post details on the forums as 
soon as the documentation has been released...<br><br>My crew and I have
 already done some preperations for the next production of mine "Power 
Of The Rings III", which will be the third and final episode on my 
"Power Of The Rings" saga. As everything is still in its primal stage I 
cannot make announcements too much yet, only that a mysterious young 
girl will be the main character and that this episode will bring the 
answers to the mysteries left open in the first two episodes...<br><br>Further
 more I alos have ideas for a second episode of "The Fairy Tale", and 
also another RPG concept that will be in a style very unlikely for an 
RPG, but I'm not going into too much detail yet...<br><br>Once more is known about the things stated in this worklog, I'm going to post on the forums...<br> <br><br> -- Tric<br><br><img src="5262&amp;log=1155_files/121914_s.jpg"><br><a href="http://www.tbbs.nl/Free.php4" target="_blank">Free Stuff For Game Programmers</a><br>"Computer

 the Fairy Tale I wanted to create an RPG game is a true Fantasy 
environment, where fantasies like Dwarves, Fairies, Elves, Dragons and 
that kind of stuff comes alife...<br><br>However this kind of concept is
 really easy to get into one big cliché... My object was to create a 
strong story with all elements of an average fantasy story, without 
getting a story that would be so cliché that you know the outcome even 
before you started on it... <br><br>The story was thus the most 
important factor to work on for me, even before I started on the first 
line of code... A story of love was the first thing that came to my 
mind, and love has always been a factor that serves RPG games very well,
 so a love story would do, but since writing pure loves stories is A. 
not my forte, and B. not suited for an RPG, there had to be more... I 
decided to put out the cliché of Romeo and Juliet of a forbidden love 
out of the closet, but to give it such a twist that very old mysteries 
would come to light, and those mysteries worked out better than I 
thought, and before I knew it I amazed myself with a brilliant story for
 an RPG if I may say so myself...<br><br>For the game itself I chose the
 old-school fashioned RPG style like the old Final Fantasy games, Breath
 Of Fire, and more games from those times... Mixed in some elements from
 modern RPG games like Grandia and Wild Arms, and so I started coding...
 <br><br>Much things have been implented, like voice acting and bonus 
missions, a nice gift is that when you manage to win the game you will 
be allowed to hear the voice acting samples we rejected for obvious 
reasons :)<br><br>My friends helped me to support the game with music 
that really suits and RPG, and all together, I think a full-fledged RPG 
game is being made out of this process...<br><br>There's still a lot to 
be done... Pretty soon I'm planning to reveal some a part of the story 
so that you might have a little idea, what the story is about.... A few 
screenshots and more pictures might also be added to this worklog as 
things are progressing...<br><br>Stay tuned!<br> <br><br> -- Tric<br><br><img src="5262&amp;log=1155_files/121914_s.jpg"><br><a href="http://www.tbbs.nl/Free.php4" target="_blank">Free Stuff For Game Programmers</a><br>"Computer

 In the past I coded a game called "Power Of The Rings II" in Visual 
Basic... The game is an RPG, and the sequel to my DOS RPG Game "Power Of
 The Rings".....<br><br>However, Visual Basic is never meant to code 
games, and that made the game so instable... On most machines it refuses
 to work, and if it works it crashes continiously...<br><br>That's why I
 translated the Visual Basic code into Blitz Basic... That is easier 
said than done, since Visual Basic and Blitz are totally not alike... 
The main convertation is done... But the Blitz version does totally not 
operate as it should (which is not very surprising), so I'm working to 
fix everything that Blitz does not understand so well... <br><br>I left 
the converation project alone, but I sure don't want the game go in 
vain, especially now that the final sequal "Power Of The Rings III", 
which solves all problems for the player of POTR1 and POTR2, is slowly 
to get on the way... So the convertation on POTR2 will be resumed...<br><br>I hope I can manage to get the code into Blitz to make the game much more stable than the VB version ever was...<br><br><br><br>I can already say that the game contains lots of dungeons, voice acting, side quests, bosses and optional bosses...<br> <br><br> -- Tric<br><br><img src="5262&amp;log=1155_files/121914_s.jpg"><br><a href="http://www.tbbs.nl/Free.php4" target="_blank">Free Stuff For Game Programmers</a><br>"Computer
