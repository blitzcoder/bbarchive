 im currently not working directly on this project, although im working 
to gain knowledge that i could apply to it.  i recently picked up:<br><br>3D Game Engine Architecture by David H. Eberly<br><br>and
 am finding it a very good read that is hard to put down.  the proposed 
engine design is a bit different than others i have seen but all the key
 components are there.  the later chapters on physics and collisions may
 prove most useful for this project.<br><br>also, im working on a 
utility project that if completed, will give mod developers the ability 
to host their own mod servers outside of the realm of BRL using PHP and 
MySQL.<br> <br><br> <a href="http://www.g2-games.com/" target="_blank">G-Squared Games</a> | <a href="http://irrlicht.gprogs.com/" target="_blank">Forum for My BlitzMax Irrlicht mods &amp; Other Freebies</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>havent had a lot of time of late...</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2005-12-05)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> here is the mod in its current state.  incomplete and heavily pre-alpha stage.  has source this time.<br><br><a href="http://www.grandberg.us/gg.IrrB3D/2005_12_05_irrb3d_mod.zip" target="_blank">2005_12_05 gg.IrrB3D Mod Pre-Alpha</a><br> <br><br> <a href="http://www.g2-games.com/" target="_blank">G-Squared Games</a> | <a href="http://irrlicht.gprogs.com/" target="_blank">Forum for My BlitzMax Irrlicht mods &amp; Other Freebies</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>updates for Irrlicht v0.14</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2005-12-04)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> the mods have been updated to be Irrlicht v0.14 compatible.<br><br><a href="http://www.gprogs.com/gg.Irrlicht/2005_12_04_irrlicht_mods.zip" target="_blank">2005_12_04 gg Mods for Irrlicht v0.14/BMAX v1.14</a><br><br>and the .a and .dll files have been updated to Irrlicht v0.14:<br><br><a href="http://www.gprogs.com/gg.Irrlicht/IrrDX_v0_14.zip" target="_blank">IrrDX_v0_14.zip</a><br><br>NOTE:

 much of my free time i have been, amongst other things, busy reworking 
mods for v1.12 of bmax.  the last thing i was doing with gg.IrrB3D was 
checking the differences between B3D scale and Irrlicht scale routines. 
 i have thought about this quite a bit and have come to a conclusion 
that one of my original design goals for gg.IrrB3D is flawed.  instead 
of trying to make commands _exactly_ compatible with B3D functions both 
in parameter type and expected value, i should really just be trying to 
create the command set itself.  too much will go into conversions and 
such each loop to really make an "exact as possible" command set viable.
  the result, i will no longer be trying to exactly match B3D commands 
with gg.IrrB3D.  the commands will be there (ie near all B3D functions 
will be represented), but the parameters and values needed for the 
parameters will be what Irrlicht is expecting and more than likely 
incompatible with the _exact_ same command in B3D.  in the end this will
 definately be a good thing as it peels off a complexity layer and gets 
me back to moving forward with the command set.<br> <br><br> <a href="http://www.g2-games.com/" target="_blank">G-Squared Games</a> | <a href="http://irrlicht.gprogs.com/" target="_blank">Forum for My BlitzMax Irrlicht mods &amp; Other Freebies</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>BMAX v1.12 compatible mods</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2005-11-15)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> BMAX v1.12 compatible mods are now available:<br><br><a href="http://www.grandberg.us/gg.Irrlicht/2005_11_15_gg_mod.zip" target="_blank">2005_11_15 gg Mods for Irrlicht v0.12/BMAX v1.12</a><br><br>i have yet to redo all the samples.  for now most, if not all, should work by simply removing the FlushMem call.<br> <br><br> <a href="http://www.g2-games.com/" target="_blank">G-Squared Games</a> | <a href="http://irrlicht.gprogs.com/" target="_blank">Forum for My BlitzMax Irrlicht mods &amp; Other Freebies</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>BMAX v1.12 update</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2005-11-15)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> adds support for the new BMAX v1.12 GC without FlushMem().  also includes source!<br><br><a href="http://www.grandberg.us/gg._3Impact/2005_11_15_gg_3Impact.zip" target="_blank">2005/11/15 release of the 3Impact mod</a><br> <br><br> <a href="http://www.g2-games.com/" target="_blank">G-Squared Games</a> | <a href="http://irrlicht.gprogs.com/" target="_blank">Forum for My BlitzMax Irrlicht mods &amp; Other Freebies</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Online API Documentation</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2005-11-05)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">

 ive been working madly on the collision system and its nearly complete.
  it will be as near to the B3D system as possible, but with some very 
cool twists.  essentially the new system is modular with built-in 
elements that try to replicate the B3D system.  you can customize the 
built-in detection and response types or create completely new ones.  <br><br>the current built-in detection types are:<br><br>Const CD_SPHERE_SPHERE:Int=1<br>Const CD_SPHERE_POLY:Int=2<br>Const CD_SPHERE_POLY_STATIC:Int=3<br>Const CD_SPHERE_BOX:Int=4<br>Const CD_BOX_BOX:Int=5<br><br>the current built-in response types are:<br><br>Const CR_NOTHING:Int=0<br>Const CR_STOP:Int=1<br>Const CR_SLIDE_XYZ:Int=2 ' slides on all axis (full slide)<br>Const CR_SLIDE_XZ_UP:Int=3 ' slides just on UP, X &amp; Z axis<br><br>hopefully
 with the customization capabilities i have included, moving to a 
different collision system (ie Newton or ODE) would be fairly easy

 the goal of gg.IrrB3D is to create a flexible framework based on the 
B3D command set for use in BMAX.  the underlying renderer will be 
Irrlicht via the Irrlicht mods.  while there will hopefully be a 
one-to-one function for every B3D 3D and 2D command, some parameters 
will be different.  while you can use the functions, under the framework
 will be OO.  this means that the functions are simply wrappers for 
method calls on objects.  this means that essentially you wouldnt even 
need to call the functions and that you can extend the base IrrB3D types
 to add functionality as desired.<br> <br><br> <a href="http://www.g2-games.com/" target="_blank">G-Squared Games</a> | <a href="http://irrlicht.gprogs.com/" target="_blank">Forum for My BlitzMax Irrlicht mods &amp; Other Freebies</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>initial release!</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2005-10-01)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> here you go :)  the initial mod release is ready.  follow the install directions in the CHM in the docs directory.<br><br><a href="http://www.grandberg.us/gg._3Impact/2005_10_01_gg_3Impact.zip" target="_blank">2005/10/01 release of the 3Impact mod</a><br><br>enjoy :)<br> <br><br> <a href="http://www.g2-games.com/" target="_blank">G-Squared Games</a> | <a href="http://irrlicht.gprogs.com/" target="_blank">Forum for My BlitzMax Irrlicht mods &amp; Other Freebies</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>looking good</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2005-09-28)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">

 as what happens often in the programming world, when i had time to stop
 and think i came up with a better design in mind for the 3Impact mod.  
what does this mean?  it means it will be _much_ easier to use out of 
the box and that it will help utilize some of the benefits of BMAX 
giving the developer a bit more flexibility than just using 3Impact 
alone.  of course, you do not have to use  any of the features im adding
 if you wish and just use the straight 3Impact commands.  the drawback 
is that although i had the entire 3Impact interface ready for BMAX and i
 was converting samples, now i am back to being finished down to BODY.<br><br>on
 a side note, since i am putting a lot of extra work above and beyond 
just an interface mod it will need to be maintained by me and thus when 
the mod is released it will be called gg._3Impact.<br> <br><br> <a href="http://www.g2-games.com/" target="_blank">G-Squared Games</a> | <a href="http://irrlicht.gprogs.com/" target="_blank">Forum for My BlitzMax Irrlicht mods &amp; Other Freebies</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>sick with flu :(</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2005-09-20)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">

	   ' For example, If up-arrow is pressed, we add a 10 meter Long vector
	   ' To the accumulator. Its direction is towards Z-positive world axis.

	   ' We want To re-orientate the resulting acceleration vectors so that they
	   ' are camera relative. For example, we want an acceleration towards X+ axis To be
	   ' re-orientated so that it becomes an acceleration towards the Right of the screen.
	   ' To achieve this, we first store the camera orientation in a quaternion variable.
	   ' Note: most physics engine quantities (locations, forces, torques, etc) can be stored

	   ' say that it is the current camera orientation, but it is a rotation actually. 
	   ' So, we basically apply that orientation To the given vector. The result

	   ' Controls are easier now that applied acceleration has been made camera-relative.
	   ' Still we aren't done yet. Controlling the ball when the camera is pitched (for
	   ' example facing downward) isn't very easy. For some reason, it would be easier
	   ' If acceleration vector direction was always parallel To the XZ (ground) plane.
	   ' To constrain the vector To the XZ plane we just have To force its Y
	   ' coordinate To zero. Note that this may reduce vector length (intensity) on
	   ' extreme camera pitching, but it is ok For this simple example.

'  By WeirdPumpkin.

'  This demo is based on the AlphaTexture demo. It has been modified To handle any number of masked objects,
'  automatically calculating the correct rendering priority order with a fast linked-list algorithm.
'  If you can find a better way, either by improving the sorting Or finding a workaround which eliminates the
'  entire need For sorting, please let me know.

'  The user controls the red ball. Move the red ball around And between the other balls, And knock them around.
'  You should find that distant balls are always visible through closer balls, regardless of which balls obscure which.
'  If you find a Case where this isn't so - let me know as well.

'  You can increase the number of balls easily. Just set the Balls constant, And specify locations For the balls.
'  Apart from that, the rest is handled automatically.

 porting was going better than expected but there was a looming issue in
 the back of my mind.  i was essentially creating an extremely large and
 untested module from an extremely large, tested engine.  i had been 
trying to think of what to do about that and i finally came up with a 
solution.  the good news is i should get out a working module much 
faster and it should meet most of my original goals of the port.  the 
only issue is that it will not be a full port yet.  i worked out a way 
that i can seamlessly replace any C++ class in Irrlicht with a BMAX type
 using a design similar to how i bound types to classes for the original
 Irrlicht mod.  this allows me to just replace what is needed to make it
 crossplatform/BMAX (ie. I/O classes and video driver classes) while 
keeping a majority of the already tested C++ code that is currently fine
 in all environments.  in addition, i can replace C++ classes as i go 
with the goal of this mod being to end up with all C++ classes replaced.
  a few cool things about this... <br><br>a) i can use all the classes i have already ported when the time is right so im not just throwing away all i have done so far.  <br>b) i can test as i go.  replace a class and test the new BMAX code versus the old C++ code.<br>c) when all classes have been replaced, i can use the types i created for this mod for the final full-port mod<br>d)
 this will be a direct modification of gg.Irrlicht and will be fully 
compatible with gg.IrrBMAX.  so hopefully all you need to do is a 
recompile.<br><br>so thats it.  no time estimate yet, but the amount of 
classes i have to port to get something working directly from BMAX has 
dropped significantly.<br> <br><br> <a href="http://www.g2-games.com/" target="_blank">G-Squared Games</a> | <a href="http://irrlicht.gprogs.com/" target="_blank">Forum for My BlitzMax Irrlicht mods &amp; Other Freebies</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Irrlicht port status</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2005-07-27)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> updated - <b>2005/8/10</b> - ON HOLD...

 currently the port is slated as mod gg.IrrConv but i believe that will 
change.  as soon as the port is done im going to break it out into the 
individual namespaces so that individual components can be used.  this 
means that things like the IO namespace can be used in any project on 
its own without the need to include the entire Irrlicht mod set.  also, 
each namespace will be broken into interface and implementation.  this 
means that if you want, you can substitute your own version of something
 like the IO types by importing the IO interface and creating your own 
types.  <br><br>GFX DRIVERS: initially i plan to support OpenGL.  after 
that, i will make a good attempt at the DX stuff.  if anything, i will 
keep the DX stuff wrapped and write an interaction layer that will allow
 BMAX to use the C++ DX classes.  the ultimate goal is to have all 
drivers that Irrlicht has including the software driver.<br><br>DIFFERENCES:
 like the wrapper, im going to try to keep as true to Irrlicht as 
possible.  also, converting from the wrapper to the port should be 
fairly painless.  the major naming convention change will be that the 
T_irr prefix will be just T.  another big change is that im going to try
 to enhance the factory capability a bit to help in customizing of 
things like scenenodes.  this new functionality will be there, but it 
will not be required to use.  last, any classes where there was a 
reasonable counterpart in BMAX i have converted to use that.  ie. the 
arrays containing structs and classes in Irrlicht were essentially BMAX 
TList object.<br> <br><br> <a href="http://www.g2-games.com/" target="_blank">G-Squared Games</a> | <a href="http://irrlicht.gprogs.com/" target="_blank">Forum for My BlitzMax Irrlicht mods &amp; Other Freebies</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Is all quiet?</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2005-07-25)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 while i have not yet updated the current wrappers to v0.11 (and 
depending on how things go i may not), i am still working with 
Irrlicht...  i am working on a full BMAX port of the Irrlicht engine.  
this means hopefully everything (may exclude the DX stuff for now) will 
be native BMAX code and perfectly portable to all OS without the need to
 link any libs or provide any DLLs.  i have no idea how its going to 
turn out performance-wise so lets hope for the best :)<br><br>STATUS: 
the Interface (all IClassname classes), structs, and core classes have 
been completely ported and i have started porting the actual 
implementation classes.  no telling when i will be done (i would guess 
at least a month out), but i will do my best to update here as i get to 
certain milestones.<br><br>WHY!?!? - well... without binding (see below 
for info on binding) every single class, i felt the wrap just didnt give
 the flexiblity that i felt Irrlicht in BMAX needed to really take off 
(mac support and other misc things too).  if at some point i deem the 
conversion not worth it, i will convert the wrapper to the current 
version of Irrlicht at that time and begin binding all classes.<br><br>NOTE

 is a BMAX type wrap of the Irrlicht 3D engine utilizing the functions 
exposed by gg.Irrlicht.  each wrap function should corrospond with a 
method in a BMAX type.  care was taken to make the BMAX types as similar
 to their C++ counterpart as possible.  ideally, you can find 
information about a certain type or type method simply by looking it up 
in the Irrlicht manual.  using the types should be very similar to 
working with the C++ classes.  this makes understanding examples written
 in C++ easy.<br><br>- folder convention<br><br>each namespace in 
Irrlicht has its own folder in gg.IrrBMAX.  these folders contain the 
type wrapper files for the classes in the given namespace.  the lone 
exception is the "bound" directory.  this directory houses any bound 
type (see binding) that also has an unbound type.<br><br>- file convention<br><br>each
 Irrlicht class file has a corrosponding type .bmx file.  the name of 
the file directly reflects the name of the type inside.  for example, 
the type wrap for Irrlicht class ITexture will be in a file called 
itexture.bmx.<br><br>- naming convention<br><br>type names are the same 
as their C++ counterpart but with the prefix T_irr.  i named them this 
way to help guarantee uniqueness among the other modules in case the 
BMAX developer chooses to not use the Framework command.  so for 
example, ITexture in C++ becomes T_irrITexture in BMAX.  all methods 
should be named the same as the C++ class methods with the exception of 
methods that are overloaded.  due to BMAX not allowing method 
overloading these have been broken out into multiple methods in the BMAX
 types.  i tried to name these something that corrosponded with the 
parameters being passed in.  for example, if vector3df had 2 methods 
called set(), one with 3 integer parameters and another with a vector3df
 parameter, i would call the 2 methods in BMAX setFromVals() and 
setFromVect().<br><br>- base types<br><br>there are 2 base types in 
gg.IrrBMAX, bound and unbound.  each type contains 2 subtypes, managed 
and unmanaged.  managed types are maintained for the most part by the 
Irrlicht 3D engine.  an instance extended from a managed type can be set
 to Null but it will still be there because Irrlicht still has a 
reference to it.  any type based on T_irrIUnknown will be managed.  
unmanaged types are usually used as parameters or type fields such as 
vectors or dimensions.  managed types are components of Irrlicht that 
are added to the Irrlicht system such as meshes, scenenodes, and images.
  Irrlicht stores pointers to these components and manages them.<br><br>- create vs new<br><br>since
 there are no parametertized New() methods in BMAX, all instances of 
types are created using that types "create" functions.  you should _not_
 use the keyword "New" to create BMAX type instances.  for many types, 
there are multiple create functions.  all create and return an instance 
of the type, but each accepts different parameters.  for example, to 
create an instance of T_irrVector3df you could:<br><br>Local temp:T_irrVector3df=T_irrVector3df.createFromVals(1,2,3) <br>  or<br>Local temp:T_irrVector3df=T_irrVector3df.createFromVect(vect2)<br><br>- pointers to C++ class instances<br><br>each
 instance of a BMAX type contains a pointer to an instance of an 
Irrlicht C++ class.  this pointer is used to call the methods and access
 the properties of the instance.  for the most part, pointers are 
maintained behind the scenes by the BMAX types.  each type has a method 
called createFromHandle().  this method creates a new instance of the 
type and attaches a pointer to a C++ class to it.  there are 2 
parameters, the first being the pointer and the second is a logical 
telling the type whether it needs to manage the pointer or not.  if you 
need to manually create type instances based on a C++ instance pointer, 
this is the function to use.<br><br>- extending types<br><br>most types 
in gg.IrrBMAX are types that wrap a C++ class and thus are set to 
"Final", disallowing extending of the type.  this decision was made to 
avoid confusion.  for example, if you extended T_irrISceneNode, overrode
 a few methods, and then passed that on to the Irrlicht engine, you 
might expect your extended code to run but it will not.  the only time 
this will work is using bound types (see binding).  there are some 
unbound types without the "Final" but these are types that have other 
unbound types extending from them.  the only types that are truly 
extendable for use by both the Irrlicht engine and your code in BMAX are
 the bound types.<br><br>- binding<br><br>bound types allow BMAX code to
 be called by the C++ Irrlicht engine.  essentially an instance of a C++
 class stores a reference to an instance of a BMAX type.  it passes this
 reference to the bound BMAX functions so that the appropriate method 
can be called.  bound functions reside inside of the type definition 
making a bound type self contained.  if you wish to manually remove an 
unmanaged, bound type you must call the Destroy() method.  for managed 
types, this calls the corrosponding drop() method.  for unmanaged types,
 this deletes the corrosponding C++ pointer.  be sure that nothing else 
holds a reference to the unmanaged type when you call its Destroy() 
method.<br><br>- bound type create functions<br><br>one of the drawbacks
 of using a create function to create a type instance is that when you 
extend a type, you must override any function that performs a "New".  
worse yet, any function that calls the function performing the new must 
be overridden because if called from within the base type, the base 
version is called.  some example code that shows this problem is:<br><pre class="code">Framework BRL.Basic

Type t1
	Function test1()
		test2()
	EndFunction
	
	Function test2()
		DebugLog("t1")
	EndFunction
EndType

Type t2 Extends t1
	Function test2()
		DebugLog("t2")
	EndFunction
EndType

t2.test1()
</pre><br>in the above example, you might expect "t2" to be displayed, 
but not so.  even though you overrode test2(), since test2() is being 
called from a function you didnt override, the t1 version is called.  to
 get around this, i implemented the generate() function.  each time you 
extend a bound type, you must override the generate function and return 
an instance of the new type, but it needs to be cast to the base type.  
this generate function is then used as the first parameter to all the 
create functions.  to implement this methodology in the above sample:<br><pre class="code">Framework BRL.Basic

Type t1
	Function test1(pTest2())
		pTest2()
	EndFunction
	
	Function test2()
		DebugLog("t1")
	EndFunction
EndType

Type t2 Extends t1
	Function test2()
		DebugLog("t2")
	EndFunction
EndType

t2.test1(t2.test2)

 is a functional wrap of the Irrlicht 3D engine.  all possible methods 
of nearly all Irrlicht classes are wrapped by extern defined C 
functions.  these functions accept a pointer to an instance of an 
Irrlicht class along with all parameters and then calls the appropriate 
method.<br><br>- folder convention<br><br>each namespace in Irrlicht has
 its own folder in gg.Irrlicht.  these folders contain the wrapper files
 for the classes in the given namespace.  the lone exception is the 
"bound" directory.  this directory houses any bound class (see binding) 
that also has an unbound functional wrap.<br><br>- file convention<br><br>each
 Irrlicht class wrap is broken into 2 files.  a _wrap.h file that 
defines the wrapper C functions and a _wrap.bmx file that exposes those 
functions publicly to BMAX.  the name of the file directly corrosponds 
with the name of the Irrlicht class so for example, ITexture has 2 files
 called itexture_wrap.h and itexture_wrap.bmx<br><br>- naming convention<br><br>the
 exposed function names follow the format IrrNamespace_Class_method 
where namespace, class, and method all depend on the class being wrapped
 and what namespace it falls under.  for the most part, all functions 
are named precisely, but there is an exception.  since there are no 
overloaded methods in BMAX, each overloaded version of a method must be a
 seperate function.  i tried to name these something that corrosponded 
with the parameters being passed in.  for example, if vector3df had 2 
constructors, one with 3 integer parameters and another with a vector3df
 parameter, i would call the 2 constructors _newFromVals() and 
_newFromVect().  constructor functions use _new() for the method name.<br><br>- enumerations<br><br>all
 enumerations in Irrlicht have been broken out into their own files.  
these files are housed in the appropriate namespace directory and are 
included publicly in gg.Irrlicht.  the name of the enumeration has 
stayed the same, but without the enumeration prefix.  the enumeration 
prefix is used as the name of the file.<br><br>- binding<br><br>there 
are some C++ classes that are able to be "bound" to a BMX type.  these 
classes are a subclass of an Irrlicht C++ class and essentially map each
 method to a corrosponding function in BMAX using function pointers.  
these classes also store an instance of a BMX type to a property.  this 
allows the BMX instance of the type to fall out of scope or be set to 
null without breaking the binding.  when a bound function is invoked in 
BMX, it uses this binding to call the appropriate code for the BMX type 
instance.  this allows the C++ code to call code written in BMAX as if 
it were in C++ (see sample 03.CustomSceneNode).  <br><br>NOTE: 
gg.IrrBMAX wraps the bindings up so that you wont have to deal with them
 manually.  you essentially extend a bound type and override the methods
 as you would have in C++.<br><br>- differences<br><br>1) all 
interaction between BMAX and the C++ wrapper functions use pointers for 
anything other than base variable types.  the pointers passed in must be
 managed by the caller if needed.  for example, if the caller creates a 
pointer to an instance of SColor using the SColor_new() function, they 
must be sure to call the SColor_del() function to delete the pointer 
when they are done.  all classes that are not based on IUnknown have a 
corrosponding _del() function to allow deletion of the created pointer 
and a _new() function to create a new instance and return a pointer.  
the C wrapper functions handle all needed conversions for the pointer 
parameters to the original parameters. <br><br>NOTE: the unbound Types in gg.IrrBMAX handle _del() and _drop() pointer management automatically.<br><br>2)
 array parameters or return values that were straight arrays have been 
converted to use the Irrlicht array&lt;T&gt; template class.  the C 
wrapper functions handle all needed conversions.<br><br>3) anything that
 returned a const reference to a variable returns a new instance pointer
 to disallow any changes to the original.<br><br>4) there are several wrapped versions of array&lt;T&gt; classes to try to handle pretty much anything you might need.<br><br>5)
 most properties requiring direct access have been exposed using 
functions.  these functions usually start with get and set and are 
combined with the property name.  so if there was a property defined 
called Box, the corrosponding get/set methods would be _getBox() and 
_setBox().<br><br>6) the lock() methods of IImage and ITexture have been
 expanded to lock16(), lock32(), and lock8().  based on your image data 
type, use the proper one to directly modify the information.<br><br>7) operator overloads have been converted into functions.<br> <br><br> <a href="http://www.g2-games.com/" target="_blank">G-Squared Games</a> | <a href="http://irrlicht.gprogs.com/" target="_blank">Forum for My BlitzMax Irrlicht mods &amp; Other Freebies</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Samples</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2005-04-27)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> updated:<br><b>2005/05/16</b> - <b>split screen sample is done</b><br><b>2005/05/12</b> - sample 10 is done<br><b>2005/05/02</b> - sample 03 is done<br><b>2005/04/29</b> - sample 12 is done<br><b>2005/04/28</b> - sample 09 is done<br><br>im

that wrap all the methods of the Irrlicht classes/structures into C

extern statements. the second mod (gg.IrrBMAX) contains BMAX types that 
utilize the functions exposed by gg.Irrlicht. the types in gg.IrrBMAX 
are structured to near-faithfully represent the Irrlicht classes both in
 form and use. both mods will be compilable in Windows and Linux (there 
is no Mac port yet for Irrlicht that i know of). Irrlicht itself does 
have a DLL that must be installed with it (for windows)... and something
 i assume for linux as well. im not up on linux so i will need to rely
