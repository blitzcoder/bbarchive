 have found that there will be so many variables to be handled, the 
amount seen in Football Management games or be it a little more scaled 
down! That I will now dump all but a few standard global variables and 
punch into the world of types where needed. I am compiling a list of 
types I would need and the fields contained within them, at the same 
time playing with a sub program to get a full understanding of where and
 how to use them.<br><br>Until this is done I will not continue on 
building the game. I have decided to initially get the game out earlier 
than later, I will release version 1 as quickly as possible (removing 
all major bugs first!). This means that the game will start with a small
 storyline and initial asthetics will functionable only, where I will 
add to as the game progresses to V2. The initial price will reflect 
that! So until version 2, all users will get a major discount. But that 
is a while off yet!<br><br>My next step will be to work on the structure
 of the storyline script. This will hand all how the game will play out 
and play, display graphics, in game movies. So I have to be carefull how
 this is going to be done. After deciding and programming this in, then 
the real easy part as far as I am concerned will come up of actually 
building gui/menus etc and then the game itself. In theory!!<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>The beginning</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2005-02-09)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Ok, I haven't decided to commit to a programming project since     the days of AMOS and Stos!<br><br>So here I am commiting to a blitz project. I have played with it enough now to start my game.<br><br>The
 game? Ok, it's a space strategy game. No big fps etc. I plan to use the
 3D for eye candy, backgrounds etc. I plan to mix movies with live 3D to
 get the look of the game. <br><br>Do do's for the moment... well thank 
god for Protean, because my project management skills are poor at best. 
so here goes for this phases to do's.<br><br>Create a core for the game.
 Make a system that handles menu's dynamically, as the game is going to 
have a few! Allow each part of the game adjustable, each variable within
 the game will be adjusted by a admin section of the game. So I can try 
various parts of the game, adjust parts at different stages. Create a 
system that reads scripts, to generate the game's story line. So more 
can be added by players eventually!!<br><br>Also create a modular 
structure for the game, so intro section (credits, settings etc) is 
seperate to the main section. I can then possibly use the intro for 
other game projects.<br><br>Once this has be completed, I can then add 
content to first story script. Some initial graphics and game style gui.
 Create some first movies to test within the game. <br><br>The next stage.. well lets get this done first?<br><br>Comments or anything, then please contact me at unforgiven@....<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
