 The idea is that you have a cell, and its one of many cells all trying 
to find the right types of food and reproduce.  All cell behavior is 
determined by their DNA, and every-time your cell gets strong enough to 
split, you can tweak its DNA.  The goal is to make sure that your line 
of cells, those cells that split off from you, take over the petri dish 
and dominate the culture - you do this by observing other cells DNA and 
modifying your own to avoid their weaknesses and take advantage of their
 strengths.<br><br>The game has a simple structure:<br><br>At game-start
 you observe all of the cells living, and you pick one to become yours. 
 When that cell splits, the game freezes and goes into tweak mode.<br><br>In
 tweak mode, you can cruise around with time frozen and examine the DNA 
of other cells, their history in terms of DNA lineage and how healthy 
they have been recently, and observe a family tree of the whole culture,
 to see how cells that have split off from yours have been progressing 
at taking over the culture.  You then modify your cell's DNA, and end 
tweak mode.<br><br>Back in realtime mode, time progresses, your cell, 
your family, and other cells all move around, find food and compete with
 each other.  You can speed up time, or use this as crucial observation 
time in order to identify advantageous cell DNA setups to help your 
planning in the next tweak stage.  The game ends if your cell dies, 
(failure) or if the only cells remaining in the culture are of your 
family.<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
