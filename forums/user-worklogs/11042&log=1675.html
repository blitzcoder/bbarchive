 well its surprising how fast things go some days.  I just spent about 
an hour adding a physics body type with parent/child abilities as well 
as rotation movement and different physics manipulations.  Its actually 
really cool to be able to write something in such a short time because 
of my physics engine and my math.bmx (so helpful)  It handled so much of
 the stuff I needed for physics body type through its useful random 
functions that I included that instead of 5 hours, i only needed 1. :)<br><br>ok new vids up<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgWCU1Uiol4" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgWCU1Uiol4</a><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnmVKhI4kyI" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnmVKhI4kyI</a> <br><br> ______________________________<br><br>-NTG<br><br><a href="http://naillproductions.synthasite.com/" target="_blank">http://naillproductions.synthasite.com</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Physics body type</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-08-14)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 ok so I have improved the physics engine a little bit now although I 
have taken a long break. I added and am working on a physics body type 
(pbody for short) that will allow the user to easily load and save 
physics bodies as well as giving them rotational speed, and other 'high 
level' physics engine features<br><br>These features will allow me to 
make FLOOD much better and will increase dev time dramaticly. They will 
also allow others to easily do things in one line that took many lines 
before such as creating boxes.<br><br>On a side note as it does not mean
 much for most people, I also implemented a simple GC system... actually
 its VERY simple and I will stick to using the same system to collect 
the garbage and pile it up for the bmax gc to take away <br><br> ______________________________<br><br>-NTG<br><br><a href="http://naillproductions.synthasite.com/" target="_blank">http://naillproductions.synthasite.com</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Back on track with my Fluid Engine</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-08-14)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Well the fluid engine is pretty much done with surface tension and 
other properties now easily adjustable (with a little trial and error)  I
 think I may add more functionality later.  You can see this 
functionality in my game FLOOD (on my website in my sig) <br><br> ______________________________<br><br>-NTG<br><br><a href="http://naillproductions.synthasite.com/" target="_blank">http://naillproductions.synthasite.com</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>lets compare... then and now</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-07-12)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> ok so here is the comparison... not much different from my last worklog update with ONE exception...<br><br><img src="11042&amp;log=1675_files/gridactive.png"><br><br>about

 so I had been rearanging the collision method and response of verlet 
max to make it more stable.  I had not run my verlet stress/speed test 
in a while but when i did, I was shocked by the results.  Without any 
optimizing algorithms (all are incomplete atm), it handled 200 blocks, 
or 800 point masses using only 11-12 milliseconds to update 
everything... I was completely shocked because last time I remember, it 
was hanging around 17-18 ms to update (since it was over 16, it was 
killing the framerate to 30 fps rather than 60... now I have a few ms to
 spare! :)  I also (intentionally this time) got rid of the crushed 
boxes problem completely and solved some of the jitters... now all thats
 left are the one-pixel jitters that come from using floating point vars
 for x,y coords which I have not found a solution to unfortunately.... 
Sometimes I wish bmax drawing functions would draw 2d sprites at say 1.5
 pixels rather than rounding up to 2 or down to 1<br><br>anyway. for now here is a screenshot with exactly 200 blocks that had a few minutes to settle.<br><br><img src="11042&amp;log=1675_files/box%2520stack.png"> <br><br> ______________________________<br><br>-NTG<br><br><a href="http://naillproductions.synthasite.com/" target="_blank">http://naillproductions.synthasite.com</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>getting organized</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-06-25)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> so I have been working on this on and off for a while and discovered some things in the process:<br><br>1.
 physics is so much fun to play with, I spend so much time playing 
around with demos that I hardly have any time to add to the engine.<br><br>2.
 sometimes it is best to just take a month off and everything looks much
 better when you come back... I swear it must have programmed itself 
better<br><br>3. stay organized.  it got messy so I organized it and since then verlet max has come along much faster than before<br><br>so
 thats what I learned. I haven't done a lot of stuff that is noticable 
if you are using the engine but I have used the past few months to 
organize and change the way many things work to make it easier to work 
with and more organized.<br><br>Goals for 09<br><br>-learn about function pointers so I can add some more powerful features<br>-make polygon-polygon collisions<br>-have realistic friction<br>-add fluids<br>-make some nice threshold filters for fluids<br>-finish a shifted grid algorithm for once ( I keep messing up and having to start over )<br><br>well thats all for now <br><br> ______________________________<br><br>-NTG<br><br><a href="http://naillproductions.synthasite.com/" target="_blank">http://naillproductions.synthasite.com</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>After the break...</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-05-15)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 I just added breaking-point constraints and am working on a little
