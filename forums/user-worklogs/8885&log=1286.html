 MilliSecs() no longer used to time stuff. Everything is done with 
deltatime. This means that the pause function now functions as it 
should. (At least I haven't seen any more bugs)<br><br>One of the 
weapons stoped to hit anything. And that is strange since all weapons 
use the same collision detection functions. Have to try to track that

Haven't touched the code in the tetris attack clone for weeks. Maybe months. :P<br>The same for the other projects. (Except for the simple 3D engine. It's dead.)<br><br>The
 current project is a game where you control a big cannon and have to 
blast soldiers that jumps off planes. Or else they will run inside your 
bunker and start pulling your power cables. (You are some sort of 
HAL/SkyNet computer)<br>It had a rapid start and a lot of the things I 
wanted got implemented really fast. It has been on hold for the past 
weeks becuase of hollidays, work, sickness and other stuff but got some 
time over today for it.<br>Things yet to be done is the menus. And a big
 rewrite on some of the internals. I added a Pause function today and 
it's not a smart move to use millisecs() to time things. Going to change
 this so it uses the delta time instead. <br>( instead of doing "if 
millisecs() &gt; something_timer then" I just do "something_timer :+ dt ;
 if something_timer &gt; something_timer_limit then" )<br>Much easier to make things behave nicely when pausing/unpausing the game.<br><br>After
 this project is completed (At least it looks like it got a fair chance)

around and collect treasures and kill badies.<br> <br><br> ----<br>The RetroRemakes Framework is the best thing since slized toast!<br><a href="http://code.google.com/p/retroremakes-framework" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/p/retroremakes-framework</a><br>My site: <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/depsweb/" target="_blank">http://sites.google.com/site/depsweb/</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Is it done yet?</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2005-11-20)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Got multiple projects going. A 3D shooter, a simple network module, a 
really simple 3D engine (that is used in the 3D shooter), and that 
tetris attack inspired game I wrote about some worklog entries ago.<br><br>For
 the moment I'm redoing the graphics on the last one. Not with clay, but
 with Blender. And trying to make it look like clay/plastic/whatever. 
Looks cool so far.<br><br>I'm coding the networking module just to learn
 some more about sockets and whatnot. But I havent touched the code in a
 couple of days now. Bnetex and Tnet is way better anyway.<br><br>The 3D
 engine was progressing nicely at the beginning, but when I started to 
write that 3D shooter I choped it to pieces and just took the best 
parts. I don't know if I ever continue on that one. Lots of other 3D 
engines out there.<br><br>What now?

 doesn't compile any code, it just runs it. Not that quick either. But 
it works. I can use it as a calculator and also add new words to it from
 within. I can also create words by hooking them up to blitzmax 
functions using function pointers. And as of today it correctly imports 
external files with forth code and parses them. <br><br>But it's one big
 ugly piece of work! And I don't know how many times my computer froze 
because of a endless loop, but it looks like I found all those nasty 
bugs. <br><br>I will look for the famous "dragon book" the next time my

 Combos added to my game. The player gets twice as much score if a chain
 was formed and removed right after another. And even more score if a 
third chain was formed and removed after that. And so on. <br>Highscore system is working as well.<br>And some minor tweaks and edits here and there.<br><br>Stuff to do:<br>1) Replace the ugly graphics with some new ones made in clay.<br>2) Create some sort of intro.<br>3) Redo the menu, highscore list and splash screen. They are just black screens with some white text on. Yuck.<br><br>After that and some bug hunting, the game will be released for free. Including the source.

 My girlfriend got a brand new digital camera. I'm going to use that to 
create some graphics for my current project. I'm going to model things 
in clay and take images of them. It's been done before, I know, but it's
 fun! :)<br><br>My current project is inspired by Tetris Attack. It's 
almost done too. Things left to do is the new graphics, an intro, some 
game play tweaks and try to find all the bugs and jump on them until 
they dissapears or deserves a "feature" label.<br><br>Not sure what I 
should work on afterwards. Maybe a simple strategy game. You are a king,
 Collect taxes, Create a small army so that other kings doesn't invade 
you, Keep the population calm, etc. But I suck at game design. :P<br> <br><br> ----<br>The RetroRemakes Framework is the best thing since slized toast!<br><a href="http://code.google.com/p/retroremakes-framework" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/p/retroremakes-framework</a><br>My site: <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/depsweb/" target="_blank">http://sites.google.com/site/depsweb/</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
