 a while I've been really busy doing other projects and decided to take a
 break from development. I've spent the last two days rewriting certain 
parts of the program I didn't like and adding some more features.<br><br>In no particlular order:<br><br>1) I've decided to ditch the MDI layout in favour of the more modern multiple screen layout.<br>2) The <b>Event Coder</b> parser has been rewritten and optimised. It's now (hopefully, though not fully tested) as fast as the official IDE.<br>3) Toolbars and menu support has been added.<br>4) Ability to multi-select gadgets using either the Control key or by dragging a selection box over the gadgets.<br>5) Cut, Copy and Paste have been added properly.<br>6) Right-click menus for quick access.<br>7) Live preview and debugging of code.<br>8) The action-pad, an innovative new UI that provides quick access to common controls.<br>9) Drag and drop is now a hell of a lot better on Windows<br><br>However,
 there's still a lot to do. I still haven't tackled the Undo/Redo 
features or gadget grids or many other features I feel are necessary. <br><br>Mac
 at the moment, I don't know how it's progressing as I haven't tried to 
compile the source on it recently. Linux, for some reason, doesn't 
compile at all - it throws up some sort of error, and the most useful 
response I've had so far, is it could be with doing something strange 
with Constants...<br><br>Anyway, I hope to keep going and hopefully, 
there should be a release by July/August. I wish it would be sooner, but
 there is still a lot to do, and I've still got a busy schedule as it 
is.<br><br>I'll aim to upload some screenies soon,<br><br><br>Seb <br><br> ---<br><b>BlitzMax v1.41 with <a href="http://web.archive.org/logs/userlog.php?user=1793&amp;log=1596" target="_blank">latest MaxGUI</a></b><br><i>Running on Mac OS X 10.6, Windows 7 x64 and Ubuntu 10.04</i> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Sorting Out The Tough Stuff...</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-09-06)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Hi,<br><br>Thought
 another worklog update is due. Max'd GUI has been improved and evolved 
in many ways, see the image below (notice the new resize handles on the 
selected gadget, icon support, and now tabber and graphics canvas 
placeholder functionality):<br><br><img src="1793&amp;log=1342_files/update.html"><br><br>One major improvement that I forgot to mention here is the presence of the event coder now built-in to Max'd GUI.<br><br><b>The Event Coder Window</b><br><img src="1793&amp;log=1342_files/codebuilder.html"><br><br><b>Events for Window Gadget:</b> - <i>More to come shortly</i><br><img src="1793&amp;log=1342_files/codeevent.html"><br><br><b>Switching Between Gadgets:</b><br><img src="1793&amp;log=1342_files/codeobject.html"><br><br>Basically,

 first release of the Windows version is in very good shape, and the 
Linux one is doing better. While developing Max'd GUI, as you can 
imagine, a lot of bugs have also been found with MaxGUI modules itself 
and the FLTK Linux MaxGUI module is, to be perfectly honest, useless! A 
big thanks to Brucey for making the GTK module which works so much 
better and more reliably.<br><br>I have also started work on the help 
docs/tutorial and also made major improvements in stability and speed.

 thought I'd start a worklog for my latest project: Max'd GUI (until I 
think of a better name it's staying :P). I intend it to be a fully 
functional GUI editor for BlitzMax (written in MAX) which can eventually
 be compiled on different O/S's for cross-platfrom capability.<br><br>I 
had a few initial ideas of how I'd go about it but when I started coding
 I found them to be extremely difficult to practically implement. <br><br>Eventually,
 I found a way that I might be able to sort it out - panels. Each gadget
 has it's own "hotspot" panel that detects mouse movement, button hits 
and keyboard events.<br><br>I initially was resizing gadgets every time 
things changed but once things started being too complex (when changing 
flags with buttons, etc) I scrapped it and re-wrote the core with a new 
idea in mind: the gadget is redrawn whenever a change is made in it's 
new position. This may seem as though it would be very slow and 
sluggish, but in practice it isn't. <br><br>This solution results in 
shape, size, position, background colours, dragging, parenting, flags 
and items all being added successfully to gadgets. You can instantly 
turn a push button into a radio button (or checkbox) on-the-fly and drag
 items around the window (with them updating in real time). <br><br>Now 
for some pics. Below is a screenshot of the application once it is first
 opened. As you can see, the window is divided into 2 parts: object 
properties on the left; drawing area on the right. There is also a 
floating GADGET toolbar which you use to start adding stuff... <br><br><a href="http://members.aol.com/sebhollington123/blitz/large/start.png" target="_blank"><img src="1793&amp;log=1342_files/start.html"></a><br>Click for larger image<br><br>Once
 you have added a window, you now have access to all other gadgets which
 currently include: buttons; text fields; labels; checkboxes; radio 
buttons; panels; scroll bars; sliders; spinners; password fields; list 
boxes; combo boxes; web gadgets and rich edit controls. Here is a sample
 screenshot of all the gadgets in place in a window:<br><br><img src="1793&amp;log=1342_files/basic.html"><br><br>Max'd
 GUI features a Preview button which compiles the window to a temporary 
location so you can see what it would actually look like in your 
program:<br><br><a href="http://members.aol.com/sebhollington123/blitz/large/exporting.png" target="_blank"><img src="1793&amp;log=1342_files/exporting.html"></a><br>Click for larger image<br><br>The
 left panel provides you access to the customizable parts for each 
gadget. Simply click to select the gadget you want to change, and modify
 the info. The item will update on the fly.<br><br><img src="1793&amp;log=1342_files/props1.html"> <img src="1793&amp;log=1342_files/flags.html"><br><br>So, to recap, main features are:<br><br>&gt; <b>Cross Platform</b> - I don't have access to a Mac yet to compile on but I haven't used any Non BlitzMax commands so all should be well.<br>&gt; <b>Fully customizable</b> gadget names, text, size, position, flags<br>&gt;
 Code can be exported into BMX format at the click of a button, and then
 compiled or opened into your editor at your discretion. <i>Code is SuperStrict compliant.</i><br>&gt; <b>Projects can be saved and loaded</b> from/to Max'd GUI.<br>&gt; Includes a <b>full item editor</b> to add items to combo boxes and listboxes<br>&gt; Flags can be set using check boxes and radio buttons.<br><br>Major features I should be adding before release:<br><br>&gt; <strike>Add Gadgets: Tabber; Toolbar; Treeview</strike> Done :-)<br>&gt; <strike>Use of iconstrips, colour and fonts on gadgets</strike> Done :-)<br><br>Minor add-ons:<br><br>&gt; <strike>Picture Panels</strike> Done :-)<br>&gt; <strike>Cut, Copy and Paste functions</strike> Done :-)<br>&gt; Fully functioning options (that are actually useful) :P<br>&gt; <strike>Optional XP-style manifest addition (when on Win32)</strike> Done<br><br>So
 this is my brief introduction to my latest project. Tell me what you 
think, and if you have any feasible ideas, as this is still very much in
