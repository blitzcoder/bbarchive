 Okay, sometimes it's good to get your thoughts down on paper, screen or
 whatever.  I started writing modules for BMX about a month or more ago 
with the plan to 'plug' the little holes in an otherwise superb 
language/library.<br><br>From what I can see BMX does something very 
cool.  First it is compiled.  Alot of basic languages are interpreted 
which is deadly slow.  BlitzBasic was also compiled which made it quick 
and is what got me interested in the whole blitz thing in the first 
place.  Secondly puts power in the hands of people who can weild it if 
they learn and thirdly it allows easy cross-platform for an unbeatable 
price.  Never forget that.  You would pay orders of magnitude more for 
another commercial tool such as this.  Something you get free with C or 
C++, but not without the headaches.<br><br>Now... I'm a programmer by 
trade and my tools consist of C and C++.  In my job as a games 
programmer lately these two languages are paramount for speed and 
versatility.  It is very easy to therefore put BASIC into the inferior 
basket simply for historical and current performance reasons.  Therefore
 it is utterly refreshing to see products like Blitz3D and BMX.  They 
demonstrate that languages do not need to be slow to be easy to use.<br><br>I
 have always had a fondness for BASIC.  It was the first language I 
touched on my first computer a commodore 16.  I was 10 at that time!  
Now at almost 27, I wish for those days again :)<br><br>But anyway 
enough of my dribble.  Down to some actual thoughts on ODE for BMX.  I 
started work on an ODE module for BMX.  Work at the studio picked up 
furious pace and I have now found myself with not a lot of time...  but 
don't worry I plan to finish it soon.  The main interface is almost 
complete, but there's other stuff that needs a lot of work.<br><br>First
 however I have been thinking alot about writing a small 3d sandbox 
module for BMX.  What would the sandbox module do?  Well it would allow 
you to set a camera, some lights and add primitives to a scene.  The 
more and more I think about it, the more I realise that it is important 
to be able to test the physics stuff out correctly.<br><br>So that is 
what I'll do first before finishing the ODE module.  As always I will 
release my work to the BMX community.  The community that always helped 
me deserves my help.<br><br>Tommy.<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
