 The converters I was writing to convert all my external media for Dark 
Tower are finished. I now have no external files for the project. All 
have been converted to Blitz include files. The converters will handle 
any file type I through at it now. I don't have to be concerned about 
pak files and such. :)<br><br>I am now trying to decide whether to 
include muliplayer LAN code above and beyond the normal multiplayer the 
base game will have. Hmm, TCP versus UDP, etc. :(<br><br>Coding progress includes:<br>Added functions to handle 'include' files for the graphics, models, sounds, music, etc.<br><br>Added function to handle updating the Dark Tower classic scoring board, including the Red pegs and territory keys.<br><br>Converted
 the help subsystem to HTML files. Not sure whether to keep this as is 
or convert to in-game screens. There are a LOT of text and graphics and 
HTML makes the presentation easy. In-game would be a pain, but once beta
 testing begins, the feedback will be the ultimate say.<br><br>Martin Parrott<br> <br><br> Desktop:2.67GHz Core i7 920 - 12GB Ram - eVga Geforce GTX 260 - Vista 64 SP1 w/Directx 10<br>Laptop: Sager 5660-C, 2.4GHz P4 - 512MB Ram - ATI M9 64MB - WinXP Pro w/DirectX 9.0b </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>DarkTower - from boardgame to 3D: Update 1</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2001-12-11)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Well, the attempt to write supporting programs to convert DirectX objects and bitmaps to BB source has come along quite well.<br><br>The bitmap converter is finished and works well. <br><br>The

 The original DarkTower game was issued by Milton Bradley in 1981. It 
was one of the first electronic board games of its kind. It had a large 
following and the game commands a high price on eBay even today and is 
very collectable.<br><br>My game of the same name will be an attempt to 
recreate the original game as closely as possible, but in a 3D world 
using today's advantages in coding and visualization.<br><br>My original
 code started in C++. This effort ground to a halt pretty quickly as I 
didn't have the time to code everything from the ground up. This code 
was converted to DarkBasic, but again ground to a halt because of bugs 
and limitations in DarkBasic itself. The code sat around for 9 months 
waiting on Blitz3D to become available.<br><br>Now that I have BB3D, the
 porting of the DarkBasic code has commenced and is 95% complete. The 
existing code brings the total required code for the entire game to 
about 35% complete.<br>* All the 3D modeling of the tower, pawns, buildings and playing board is complete.<br>* Model textures are complete.<br>* All sound digitizing is complete.<br>* Front end GUI for game select, options, game load/save, help, credit, etc. is complete.<br>* Skysphere and surrounding terrain is complete.<br><br>Game
 coding is currently halted while a related piece of code is being 
finished. Namely the ability to convert a DirectX model to Blitz3D 
source code. I wanted to be able to do this so the program will have no 
dependency to external models.<br><br>The game will allow 1-4 players, 
plus a tutorial mode just like the original. I am thinking about 
including the ability of to play against the computer, which the 
original did not allow.<br><br>The game concept and name of DarkTower is
 copyright Milton Bradley. If any representative of Milton Bradley would
 like to contact me for any reason, please do so at parrottm@...<br><br>Martin Parrott<br> <br><br> Desktop:2.67GHz Core i7 920 - 12GB Ram - eVga Geforce GTX 260 - Vista 64 SP1 w/Directx 10<br>Laptop: Sager 5660-C, 2.4GHz P4 - 512MB Ram - ATI M9 64MB - WinXP Pro w/DirectX 9.0b </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
