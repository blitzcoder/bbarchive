was getting a MAV when a killed enemy dissapears.  I had trouble

access the deleted arrows, and cause a MAV.) <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Further breaking down..</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2010-03-22)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">

 Wow seriously almost 2 years ago I posted my last worklog update.  
That's crazy.  The fact is I spent about 23 of the last 24 months NOT 
working on this game.  Been working on other projects.<br><br>You can 
throw away those npcs from posts below, I have new npcs, new models, new
 animations.  Those npcs below in my other posts now look like garbage 
to me.  I've been busy with seperate head models that follow the player.
  I have, just today, FINALLY (in like 3 hours) got perfect collisions 
with my animated characters.  No longer will arrows stick in the air 
where the model is "posed" in it's base pose.  I put some primitives in 
place on certain bones in my models, gave them a seperate collision 
response, then when an arrow hits one of these "parts", the arrow is 
then parented to the corresponding bone that is the parent of the 
collision box.  Sound complicated?  The complicated part was getting the
 primitives set up just right.  In actuality the process is quite 
simple.  The results though, are amazing. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Coding Inventory</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2008-04-11)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Been working on the inventory system quite furiously.  I finally have a
 working model that loads, adds, changes slots, deletes items, etc.  
Basically everything I was wanting.  I do have to still implement a 
function to let the player willingly destroy\trash an item.  Here's a 
screenshot of the demo program I created to test the inventory.  This 
program can BASICALLY be imported directly into the rpg game with only a
 few minor changes.  My game allows for a 20 slot inventory instead of 
12, which will be very simple to change over.  The inventory icons will 
be drawns over the inventory gui instead of black screen. :)<br><br><img src="10475&amp;log=1579_files/inv_test.webp"> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>A few characters</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2008-03-12)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> This is a compilation image of some of the characters and/or npcs from 1 town.<br><br>The npc's in plain clothes have 4 animations: Walking, 2 idle animations, and die.

 what I have done is ripped all the functions from my game directly into

message box states on the bottom, this is how dark it is.  It is MUCH

 be out.<br><br><img src="10475&amp;log=1579_files/darnkess.webp"><br><br>This

 Here I have modeled a crude gun, which was supposed to be a 1903, which
 I had the correct shape but I had not yet textured it.  These last 2 
shots are about 2 years old.  Actually, you can see I screwed up this 
screenshot and pasted it over another screenshot. :)<br><br>This is a 
photo of the player looking down the actual sights of a modeled m1903 
rifle.  I HATE fps games that use the center of the screen for aiming.  
If you look closely you have a front sight that you have to actually AIM
 at your target.  The gun featured a modeled bullet that was actually a 
small 3d triangle, (4 polys, you couldn't see it anyway, it shot too 
fast as in real life) which acted as a bullet and had gravity strictly 
based only on it's distance.  Not true to life but if you were aiming at
 something far away you actually had to aim your rifle above the target.
  I also built in small imperfections into the trajectory of the bullet 
so it would never go perfectly straight, always just a slight angle 
(like .1 degrees at the most) to the left, right, ect.  I may have to 
resurrect this as a new game somday.<br><img src="10475&amp;log=1579_files/alpha_fps2.webp"><br><br>I have also added some "enemies" which were basically cylinders, and removed the trees while adding some bushes. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Updating with Old screenshots</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2008-03-04)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
