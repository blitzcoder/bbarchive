 1.30e is most likely the last update the game will receive in a while 
as all the core features are in, it has been played heavily over the 
past 4 months since release in October and is very stable, balanced.<br><br>There
 is one feature I would like to add but it is a non essential feature 
that can be let out for now - it doesn't add much to the game but would 
be a fair amount of work that I am not willing to put into it at this 
stage.<br><br>Marketing efforts have finished although I will still post
 pictures, videos and blog posts about the game from time to time as I 
am still heavily playing it.<br><br>The full version has been released 
for free after I found that it was extremely difficult to gain traction 
in terms of sales. I was initially disappointed by this but then I 
should have realised that it is extremely difficult to make any sort of 
inroads financially with a game, let alone a mobile game for an indie 
developer.<br><br>I am very happy now that the game is free and I would 
love it if many people played it and enjoyed it.  That was my whole 
intention originally to make a game that people enjoy playing. If they 
don't enjoy it, then don't play it, but if they do - I really hope that 
it is enjoyed and played for hours on end.  <br><br>I understand mobile 
games are typically casual pick up and play for a few minutes. However I
 play this game for hours on end at a time while sitting in a cafe on a 
weekend. I love the space battles. It is more a space battle generator 
in some ways than a game but there is still a game element to it.<br><br>In
 my mind the game is a success because I enjoy it (the only person whose
 opinion really counts about my game) but as said - I'd love it if other
 people tried it and enjoyed it for themselves.<br><br>from Matt<br><br>The
 game is currently receiving about 10 new users per day for the full 
game and about 6 for the lite. I don't know why people still bother 
downloading the lite version now that the full is free but hey, go 
figure? <br><br> <a href="http://mattiesgames.com/" target="_blank"><img src="3317&amp;log=1905_files/banner2a.jpg"></a><br><a href="http://mattiesgames.com/articles/index.html" target="_blank">About Me</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Some basic statistics</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2015-12-22)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> I keep track of all my user metrics and keep a close eye on them.<br><br>In terms of trends it seems they are positive.<br><br>For example.<br><br>Comparing users who actually used the product vs installs (at least one use properly).<br><br>In the month of October only about 35% of users who installed the app actually used it appreciably.<br><br>In the month of December that figure is almost 80%.<br><br>This suggests to me that my changes to make the game easier and more accessible have worked.<br><br>Also, organic searches are up.<br><br>In the first two months my average organic visit to the page was about half what it has been in December.  <br><br>However
 although visits have doubled the number of downloads has not increased 
at the same rate. This is slightly worrying as it suggests that my store
 page is not as good as it should be.  <br><br>I am aware that it could be improved in many ways but at this stage I do not have the resources to do so in a signficant manner.<br><br>Visits to the store have increased by 90 and 25% respectively for the months of November and December.  <br><br>Downloads have increased but not by as much.<br><br>Downloads
 as a fraction of store visits seems to be hovering at around the 12% 
mark after starting at a high of about 18% in October.  I'm not sure if 
this is a bad result or not.<br><br>I can also tell, and I had a good 
idea of this, that users obtained through google ads are not as high 
quality as users obtained organically.  Whether this is due to language 
barriers or network availability in the countries that my ads get shown 
in I'm not sure. <br><br> <a href="http://mattiesgames.com/" target="_blank"><img src="3317&amp;log=1905_files/banner2a.jpg"></a><br><a href="http://mattiesgames.com/articles/index.html" target="_blank">About Me</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Moddable pilot chatter</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2015-12-22)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Speech packs are now a distinct possibility for the pilot chatter.<br><br>Pilot Chatter can be modded. <br><br> <a href="http://mattiesgames.com/" target="_blank"><img src="3317&amp;log=1905_files/banner2a.jpg"></a><br><a href="http://mattiesgames.com/articles/index.html" target="_blank">About Me</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Yet another promotional video</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2015-12-18)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> <iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/EcLRhcY_380" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="345" frameborder="0"></iframe> <br><br> <a href="http://mattiesgames.com/" target="_blank"><img src="3317&amp;log=1905_files/banner2a.jpg"></a><br><a href="http://mattiesgames.com/articles/index.html" target="_blank">About Me</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Comments</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2015-12-17)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">

 Advertising in a sense is a form of paying for users. Nothing wrong 
with that as such - we all do it in one form or another simply by 
spending our time, effort and resources on producing a product in and of
 itself.<br><br>However the mathematical model that I can see fits advertising or promoting a product goes something like this:<br><br>Number
 of Users Gained = k * Dollars Spent ^ n + j * Effort Spent ^ m where k 
and j are both positive, n and m are both greater than or equal to zero.<br><br>With
 advertising through google ads especially, although the k value may 
change depending on the competition for advertising space, the n value 
is equal to 1. this is why I believe adwords is not a viable method of 
advertising for small time developers.<br><br>As a smaller developer 
what you are looking for is a method where n and m are greater than 1. 
In other words - doubling the dollars and /or effort spent to get users 
results in a more than doubling of the users gained.  <br><br>Larger companies can afford to have a value close to 1 as long as k and j are high.<br><br>Smaller individuals and companies need to have a value of n and m greater than 1 with a k and j that is moderate.<br><br>Finding a method that fits this model with constraints of n,m &gt; 1 (preferably &gt;&gt; 1) is very difficult.<br><br>Personally
 I can imagine a few ways such as releasing a secondary game purely as 
advertising on a free game hosting website which would drive traffic to 
the actual game and cost the developer minimal money but a certain fixed
 amount of effort. This would hopefully give a value of m &gt; 1 and k 
close to zero (since no money is spent).  That is one method.<br><br>Another method is simply sharing the game with your friends.  However the value is capped in that case to the people you know.<br><br>Hmm...this is tricky. <br><br> <a href="http://mattiesgames.com/" target="_blank"><img src="3317&amp;log=1905_files/banner2a.jpg"></a><br><a href="http://mattiesgames.com/articles/index.html" target="_blank">About Me</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Metrics</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2015-12-10)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Rather than clutter up the forum with my posts too much I thought I'd share some metrics here.<br><br>Usage:<br><br>In
 the last week I had about 80 users install and play the app at least 1 
time.  This was the result of some advertising on Friday last week.<br><br>Of them about 17 have been found to have been active in the past 24 hours.<br><br>So
 I lose about 80% of my users after around a week. Or at least they go 
inactive. Google Play says they haven't uninstalled the app.<br><br>When
 I have a large install day (like last Friday) I find that about 1/3 of 
users who install the app uninstall on the same day.  <br><br>Also I find that the majority of users play the app once and then not again. About 65%.  <br><br>The remaining 35% play a few more times.<br><br>It
 generally gets positive reviews. I had one 1 star rating with no 
comment so it is difficult to know what they didn't like about the app 
and it stands in stark contrast to the plethora of 5+ reviews and 
ratings i've received.<br><br>From what I can understand this is quite common for most games - play once or twice and then abandon. Normal.<br><br>I
 get about a 2-3% conversion rate from free to paid (it's hard to gauge 
exactly).....have had around 10 sales and just under 500 downloads of 
the free version.<br><br>The numbers go something like this with google ads and other advertising:<br><br>20,000 impressions/views of ad.<br>500 clicks of ad<br>350 visits to page through click (I guess that signals how many were intentional)<br>150 downloads of app (30% is not too shabby I'd say)<br>70 users playing<br>20 users keep playing for more than a few days<br>1 user pays for full game. <br><br> <a href="http://mattiesgames.com/" target="_blank"><img src="3317&amp;log=1905_files/banner2a.jpg"></a><br><a href="http://mattiesgames.com/articles/index.html" target="_blank">About Me</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Grime</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2015-12-07)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> I've added a bit of grime to the ships textures in the shader to add a sense of solidity to the look of the ships.....<br><br><img src="3317&amp;log=1905_files/n1.html"><br><img src="3317&amp;log=1905_files/n4.html"><br><img src="3317&amp;log=1905_files/n3.html"><br><img src="3317&amp;log=1905_files/n2.html"> <br><br> <a href="http://mattiesgames.com/" target="_blank"><img src="3317&amp;log=1905_files/banner2a.jpg"></a><br><a href="http://mattiesgames.com/articles/index.html" target="_blank">About Me</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Checking out the competition</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2015-11-28)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">

 game session the AI players pick the same settings as one of the best 
human players in the game.  Every 20 minutes they then adjust these 
settings by a slight random variation.  As such they will eventually 
converge upon a good set of flight settings as more users play the game.
 <br><br>The patterns used by the players forms the patterns used  by 
the AI meaning the AI grows and develops with subsequent games and ove 
time.<br><br>Lovely. <br><br> <a href="http://mattiesgames.com/" target="_blank"><img src="3317&amp;log=1905_files/banner2a.jpg"></a><br><a href="http://mattiesgames.com/articles/index.html" target="_blank">About Me</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Bugfixed and Enhancements</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2015-11-10)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> The current version of the game is 1.10.<br><br>It
 has fixed a long standing bug regarding closing screens. The android 
activity lifecycle has an stopped state which I needed to use more 
effectively when the user presses the home button. Not a major thing but
 it was a bit of an annoyance.<br><br>Also a bug regarding to when the 
server timed out at times meant that on one particular screen it would 
crash out - rarely happened but it shouldn't happen at all. that has now
 been fixed although preventing the server from timing out would have 
been nice.<br><br>Balance issues are continuing - I'm still working on 
getting the balance right for both the lite and full version although at
 this stage the lite version is more pressing since that is the first 
one most users see.<br><br>I've reduced wait times for ships to rebuild -
 consistent feedback has been that it is too long although I don't want 
it to be too short and Id definitely am not going to make it an in app 
purchase as some have suggested to rebuild more quickly. I don't believe
 in that garbage.<br><br>Additional information and help text has been scattered liberally throughout the game.<br><br>I
 am thinking of putting a video into the lite version through a menu 
option with a bit of a talk from me the developer to the end user - add a
 bit of a friendly face to the game...probaby quite unusual for a mobile
 game but hey it's already quite different to most games out there.<br><br>I've
 added larger explosions to when the little ships die - previously 
sometimes the little ships would appear to just disappear.. They now 
disappear properly.  <br><br>I've also updated many of the php and postgre sql statements to be faster.<br><br>Also
 cronjobs have been added to periodically clean up the tables and update
 the ai and research settings of bot players in the game.  Nice. Every 
half hour or so the bots will adjust their ai settings and research 
settings meaning they improve as the game goes on - if the user allows 
it to go on for too long.  Often in a single player game it doesn't make
 a huge difference if the player plays very short sessions.<br><br>There
 is a minor bug that pisses me off regarding flight patterns but I can't
 really do much about - there is the occasioanl rare situation where the
 flights get into orbits that are unbreakable.  This simply means the 
battle ends as a draw. <br><br> <a href="http://mattiesgames.com/" target="_blank"><img src="3317&amp;log=1905_files/banner2a.jpg"></a><br><a href="http://mattiesgames.com/articles/index.html"

 Artist (same one) has been contracted again to do a few more bits and 
pieces - mainly update the anims I put together into something more 
pretty (bit more expensive this time but still under budget---though not
 by much, I'm expecting to be about 10% under budget by the time I 
finish assuming there are no unexpected major costs)<br><br>(Private) testing will take place in late June (not long now)<br><br>The plan then is to spend the next month implementing any serious changes needed as a result of user feedback.<br><br>Balance will be worked on as well in this time - until about mid August.<br><br>Follow up testing will take place as well around Sept.<br><br>About September start releasing 'proper' promotional videos and so on.<br><br>Re:
 advertising - (not in game - none of that thanks!) - I will probably go
 to a few common websites that are frequented by my target market and 
pay for some advertising space (not going to spend much - these are 
fairly obscure websites by world standards but the users are definitely 
my target market - hence advertising won't break the bank)   I will also
 visit some clubs/groups/events/organisations in my own city where 
potential users exist and do a bit of word of mouth advertising....<br><br><br><br>Release expected late Nov, early Dec, <br><br>I'm not expecting a huge initial sales volume but am hoping that I can grow the user base with time.<br><br>The
 product will be a paid app (still deciding on pricing) - with no ads or
 cr@p in it....a simple reason for this is to attract the users I am 
after - if I put it out for free not only do server costs become 
unsustainable if it becomes popular but I will likely get a lot more 
downloads from those I'd rather not have to deal with.<br><br>If you've listened to the Coodabeens (doubt it on this website) then "Ivan from Ivanhoe" has the right idea...... <br><br> <a href="http://mattiesgames.com/" target="_blank"><img src="3317&amp;log=1905_files/banner2a.jpg"></a><br><a href="http://mattiesgames.com/articles/index.html" target="_blank">About Me</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>updates</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2015-06-09)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">

 original design doc estimated I'd have the majority (or almost all) of 
the code done by June and that the next 3 months would be engaging 
artists etc.<br><br>Things changed slightly.<br><br>The majority of the code is done - and the majority of the media assets are done too.<br><br>The
 game is "feature complete" in a lot of ways - every part of the game 
works as it is intended - I am not going to add many more features 
(there are a handful that are going to be added a bit later).<br><br>Most
 of the artwork is in there - and the artist and I are working on a few 
more animations (I'm building samples and she will reproduce them in a 
more aesthetically pleasing manner).<br><br>The next 3 months or so as I see it are going to be spent testing, refining &amp; polishing further.  <br><br>Because
 it is my own project, and I have no deadline other than my self imposed
 December deadline I have the luxury of being able to get the product in
 the state that I want it to be before release.  <br><br>Quite happy with it.<br><br>There is some testing that needs doing related to certain multiplayer aspects but it is coming along well.<br><br><br>Stability:<br><br>The
 app is very stable however I have come across one intermittent fault on
 a particular phone.  I don't usually like saying this (because 99% of 
time the fault is with the developer) - but on a particular phone model -
 after the phone has been switched on for 3 or 4 days - with nothing 
else installed other than my game and the OS (and shovelware that comes 
with the phone) - in a phone with no sim - sometimes the app runs less 
efficiently which is remedied by switching the phone off/on.  <br><br>There
 are no memory leaks in my app (according to logs or anything else).  
However the pre installed software on the phone does seem to have leaks -
 which darn well is annoying since in my view it should be able to run 
'forever'....(on a higher quality produced phone I don't get these 
problems at all) .... blahgh! <br><br> <a href="http://mattiesgames.com/" target="_blank"><img src="3317&amp;log=1905_files/banner2a.jpg"></a><br><a href="http://mattiesgames.com/articles/index.html" target="_blank">About Me</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>work continues apace</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2015-06-02)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Animation in various interfaces is being worked on at the moment.<br><br>Testing and balancing continues.<br><br>I would say I am ahead of schedule or at the very least well on time.<br><br>Going

 I purchased a second phone to test with.  I'm not sure if it is lower 
spec than my Samsung S4 (I was hoping it would be - it's an LG H440V) 
however it outperforms the Samsung S4 in the 3d scenes amazingly.<br><br>I
 had to make a simple change to fix a glitch due to the software 
keyboard. My Samsung has a hardware keyboard but the LG has a software 
keyboard which means that when the user touches the screen the keyboard 
appears (which is fine) but it triggers onSurfaceChanged in the 
GLSurfaceView - other than that it works with no problems...<br><br>Oh actually there is one minor issue (which is not a major thing)...<br><br>The
 EP4 replay files - despite being associated with the app - don't load 
from the LG's file browser - the file browser refuses to recognise them 
since they don't fit the expected file extension.  I'll fix this 
eventually.<br><br>There are other issues too - <br><br>LG (and other 
phone like a friend's Sony phone) won't let the user install an apk via 
wifi direct (however over blue tooth is fine?)<br><br>Also - my friend's
 Sony phone for some reason doesn't have a file browser at all by 
default - which is a bit stupid in my view - but then I guess some 
companies do like to lock down a few things.<br><br>I haven't managed to
 connect adb to the LG yet...I'm not sure why it doesn't....developer 
mode etc is all switched on.....however there are other ways of checking
 logs etc with a few system permissions (not to be used in the final 
app)<br><br>Also - found a useful splitter at the shops today for HDMI 
-&gt; DVI which is helpful.....none of the staff seemed have any idea 
about what I was trying to do though so I'll probably have to go online 
to purchase (later in the year) a video capture device for DVI -&gt; MP4

 one other game out there like mine - but it is 2d (and lacks a 
strategic campaign) - looking at how it plays (from a typical wargamer 
perspective) the battles are basically 'attrition' and so are a lot 
easier to balance - you can simply measure damage output per second to 
get an idea for a game like that. However because mine is in 3d, and the
 fleets are smaller, and also because mobility is a big factor in mine -
 it is much harder to balance - it reminds me of my university days with
 ODES and a thing called "bifurcation theory" along with the idea of 
stability of a system...unfortunately a slight change to any parameter 
can set the system in a complete different direction.  This does make it
 very hard to predict - even though the game is perfectly deterministic -
 it is quite difficult to predict how large a tiny change will affect 
the final outcome....<br><br>The equivalent that is known in popular culture is the butterfly effect....<br><br>Change
 a single value (such as a ship's acceleration) and because of the 
physical systems everything changes....so hard to predict....<br><br>To 
be honest - I'll be happy if I can simply balance the starting 
combinations such that both sides in a battle lose at least 'x' ships 
with the default config where x may different in each and every case... <br><br> <a href="http://mattiesgames.com/" target="_blank"><img src="3317&amp;log=1905_files/banner2a.jpg"></a><br><a href="http://mattiesgames.com/articles/index.html" target="_blank">About Me</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Testing</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2015-05-04)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">

laser effects,<br>"warp/portal/hyperspace" effects for ships entering 
battle area, additional ui features for selecting camera angles and 
alerting user to events, improved sun<br>model, potentially the ability 
to render the replay out as a proper video file for user to submit to 
youtube etc, ships (especially large ones) need to <br>break apart and send off debris when damaged/destroyed, <br><br>Balance
 issues - making sure that the five factions (which are different) are 
balanced for competitive play - and that a single strategy/faction does 
not<br>trump all others.  This one could take a long time to get right.<br><br>Bug fixes - map problems (as discovered), <br><br>Focus
 issues - ie on the TV displays the buttons do not highlight when 
focused - need to design for both TV and phone use in mind.<br><br>Optimisations
 - server response times, remove redundant code from php scripts, 
minimise data transfer between user and server, minimise server 
computations<br>improve efficiency of replay file generation, speed up 
loading times, fix progress bar on loading screen (it doesn't move 
currently), add spinning progress<br>wheel to loading screen, <br><br>Security - encrypt user information sent to and from server, <br><br>Add
 invite system - allow user to click button which invites friends to 
play game with them (via email/facebook etc - message includes "Hi 'Joe'
 wants<br>to play game with you...click link to join game, or download from mattiesgames.com etc'<br><br>UI graphical update - before release (and before beta testing) find someone to pretty up the menus etc<br><br>User testing - at least 5-6 weeks of testing with the public (October?)<br><br>Support - ability for user to contact 'support' (ie me) with questions or requests.<br><br>Web
 page - advertising game, describing features, providing additional 
content, discussion board for players, youtube videos and promotional 
trailers,<br><br>Server upgrade - eventually move to Amazon Cloud Services (potentially) depending on likely server load.<br><br>Compatibility testing with various phones and android devices. <br><br> <a href="http://mattiesgames.com/" target="_blank"><img src="3317&amp;log=1905_files/banner2a.jpg"></a><br><a href="http://mattiesgames.com/articles/index.html" target="_blank">About Me</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>invite system</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2015-04-22)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Really, really basic invite system is in place.<br><br>Needs more to be done, however it simply generates a key which users can share with their friends to join the game.<br><br>They also need the name of the game... <br><br> <a href="http://mattiesgames.com/" target="_blank"><img src="3317&amp;log=1905_files/banner2a.jpg"></a><br><a href="http://mattiesgames.com/articles/index.html" target="_blank">About Me</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>upload to server works</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2015-04-21)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> uploading replay to server works.<br><br>next stage is the invite system and then the download system (fairly straight forward) <br><br> <a href="http://mattiesgames.com/" target="_blank"><img src="3317&amp;log=1905_files/banner2a.jpg"></a><br><a href="http://mattiesgames.com/articles/index.html" target="_blank">About Me</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Added balance tester</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2015-04-20)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">

 25k.....however there is a lot more 'supporting' code that has been 
built in the last 4 months to get it to this point - in various 
languages including javascript, blitz3d, blitzplus, java, dos batch 
files, php, and pretty much anything else that was needed to the job 
that needed doing.<br><br>I've also added ship icons (very small) to the
 replay screen which change colour when ships are damaged -&gt; green, 
yellow, orange, red, disappeared - at % health increments.  This is 
actually very useful - and is much less obtrusive than health bars, and 
is one of the reasons (as well as the music choice) that pilot chatter 
may be unnecessary.<br><br>I've decided that public updates on places 
like youtube etc will only be done about once a month or at least until 
I'm a lot further along with the project. I imagine by about August I 
will be ready to start making a bit of noise publicly. <br><br> <a href="http://mattiesgames.com/" target="_blank"><img src="3317&amp;log=1905_files/banner2a.jpg"></a><br><a href="http://mattiesgames.com/articles/index.html" target="_blank">About Me</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>still going</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2015-04-17)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Music added.  My choice of music certainly sets the tone. ..in a good

of pilot chatter in the replay is changing too.  I always knew audio was

 more ambitious than pretty much anything I've ever built.  However, 
I've learned a great deal over the past 12 months (and my health has 
completely recovered (finally - after 17 years!).<br><br>The technology the game uses is the following:<br><br>Android Java - for the app that will be used on Smart TVs and also on mobile phones.  <br><br>JPCT-AE
 the 3d library (I'll mainly use some of the Vector functions, 3d 
loaders, and GLSL routines as well as some of the basic memory 
management and camera stuff)<br><br>OpenGL ES 2.0 - shaders are nice!<br><br>PHP for interacting with the database on my webserver.<br><br>postgresql - the database system I use to manage the data.<br><br>bitbucket, git and tortoisegit for managing source control.<br><br>blitz3d
 and blitzplus for testing out various ideas, prototyping functions and 
algorithms (such as my snazzy lead targeting calc etc)<br><br>A handful of other bits and pieces.<br><br>But what is the game?<br><br>Well
 that is kind of a bit of a secret ...at the moment...mainly because  as
 I've said elsewhere - there is nothing at all like it anywhere.  Once 
I'm a little further down the track then I'll definitely be shouting 
from the roof tops.  Around June/July I should have a completely working
 build that is just awaiting the media to be created....which I hope to 
have done by October/November to allow for 6 weeks of beta testing with 
real live players.  <br><br>But....it is a strategy game.<br><br>It is multiplayer, and it is online.<br><br>It is turn based but also real time.  (think Combat Mission series for something reasonably similar in that sense).<br><br>It is set in space. - &gt; Fleet combat.<br><br>Is
 is massively multiplayer - up to 8 teams per game, but effectively no 
real upper limit on players per team (well within database limits!)<br><br>It
 is asynchronous play.  So...the user can log in when they get home from
 work, do a few actions, watch a few replays, view progress of things 
like research, builds, the war effort etc, and then put it aside until 
the next day.  They do not need the other players to be active at the 
same time (that is the whole point of asynchronous play).  <br><br>Example.
 Johnny has come home and checks his news feed.  There's a battle 
waiting for him to watch.  After viewing the battle he decides to 
counter attack with one of his fleets - especially since his nice new 
capital ship has just been built - and his research for warp implosion 
destructor devices (made up) has completed. So Johnny picks his best 
fleet, goes to the war room and launches an attack against Billy.  Billy
 however lives in another timezone and won't be up for another 8 hours 
so Johnny shuts the app down and goes about his normal daily duties.<br><br>Billy
 gets up in the morning, checks his phone and sees there is a battle. He
 runs to the living room, turns on the TV and downloads the battle to 
his Smart TV and watches it in full glorious cinematic action scenes.  <br><br>And the game goes on....<br><br>Each
 game has an upper time limit for when it is completed....set in days. 
So a game could last for a couple of days or it could be a mammoth war 
effort that lasts longer than the first world war! (I'd like to say the 
hundred years war but I doubt either my system or android will still be 
around then! - oh and I think unix time stamps finish in 2038 anyway ;-)
 )<br><br><br>In terms of features....<br><br>the game will have 
research - which is time based and proportional to the length of the 
game.  So .. when a user researches a tech it will take 'x' 
minutes/hours/days to actually be researched. When a user rebuilds a 
destroyed vessel or builds a new one it will take 'x' time as well.  <br><br>There
 is a very unique feature however - which is what sets this game apart 
from pretty much everything else ever created.  So far it probably 
doesn't sound all that unique.  However the specific feature that sets 
it apart I'm keeping to myself for now....but....the mastery of this 
aspect of the game is what will separate the good players from the elite
 players.  <br><br>The game will have voices (pilot chatter), and a 3d environment etc...<br><br>In terms of my progress so far:<br><br>I've built about 70-80% of the interface code -&gt; php scripts, xml files, <br>android activities. They all hang together nicely and work well. In June/July I'll be paying someone to pretty them up.<br><br>The
 3d engine works.  The current version (which I showed off at work) will
 change significantly however I've already seen that I can have dozens 
of spaceships flying around blasting the crap out of each other on my 
mobile in 3d.  Looks great.  My next task is to rebuild it for the 
current system - build a simulator to generate the necessary keyframes 
and then build a keyframe replay system (which is not too difficult - 
I've done it hundreds of times before over the last 10 or so years with 
other games).<br><br>The game will include a modding capability.  This 
basically will be a folder on the user's SD card in the structure 
"mod/modname/..." with sub folders for each moddable component 
(currently - all audio, certain visuals, and a few other things) - the 
user will simply select which mod they wish to activate in the options 
section and the relevant files will be loaded instead of the default 
files at run time.  They will also have the option of sending the mod to
 their friends.  <br><br>When it comes to monetising the game...still 
not sure but most likely I will probably have a nominal fee for being 
allowed to upload mods to the server for other people (who can then rank
 it).<br><br>This all sounds pretty intense for a mobile game...it 
certainly is no fracking flappy bird.   However the actual game 
interface is designed for mobile and for Smart TV...it is not a twitch 
game, it does not require complex gestures.  Most of it is menu driven. 
 Very easy to use with either a TV remote control or your mobile.  <br><br><br>In terms of time frame....<br><br>Well....
 I'm looking at having a fully functional interface (minus a handful of 
features) by the end of Feb.  Technically that is already done.  <br><br>By
 Mid April I hope to have a fully completed database (actual data) - 
with all tested and balanced out research techs, ship builds, weapon 
loadouts etc. This bit will be fun.<br><br>By the end of this weekend I 
hope to have a basic simulator written, as well as (if I'm lucky) the 
key frame viewer.  Then I actually test a few battles between a few 
devices at home. If I do that I may post a video (here .. not overly 
publicly)<br><br>By end of May I hope to have most of the tidying up done of the interface, and 3d engine etc.<br><br>That gives me June to make sure I'm happy with it.<br><br>Then June/July start hiring contractors for:<br><br>2d Interface artwork (including XML files for android)<br>3d ship models. (less than 10MB)<br>3d environment stuff (nebula, space dust, stars, planets, etc etc)<br>3d Effects (lasers, engine glows, trails, explosions, warp gates)<br>Music (menu, pre battle, post battle, a few in battle clips) - keeping this to less than 20MB<br>Audio (sound effects - standard sort of stuff)<br>Audio
 (pilot chatter - possibly about 10-20 minutes worth of audio - 5 second
 clips each...played at the appropriate time in battle (randomly chosen 
from large selection)<br>Website - need to get the actual pretty promotional stuff done (along with market/app store promos - trailers etc)<br>PR/Marketing ... hire someone to do this....or at least help out.<br><br>Actual costs involved....<br><br>Elance seems pretty good for the art work, <br>Voicebunny seems pretty good (and cheap) for the vocals.<br>Website....well I know a bunch of people....<br>Music - I've got a few leads..<br><br>I've
 worked out that total cost will be under 'x' $...(within a range) 
however this does not include any necessary server upgrades that need to
 be done.<br><br>I've actually tested parts of it on the TVs at work - 
lovely - looks nice.  Even on the 'Smart Dongle' which can turn a 
regular Tv into a Android 4.0 device through HDMI port works beautifully
 (although the image quality is slightly less)<br><br>In terms of hours 
work...I estimated when I started (on my design doc) that it would me 
400 hours to code everything that was required.  I equated that to about
 20 weeks work - roughly 2 hours a night Mon-Fri and 5 hours Sat/5 hours
 Sun....given I work full time Mon-Fri as well I'm pretty much glued to a
 screen a lot of the time...hence important to have quality rest 
time....spending time in the garden...looking at the trees etc..going 
for walks...getting fresh air...keeping fresh.  It's a good thing I 
don't have a family!<br><br><br><br>The other thing I've got to work on during spare time is the theme...artistic direction.<br><br>I've got a few ideas..<br><br>Here are some common motifs/themes for sci fi that I've seen over the years: (my own terminology)<br><br>Cartoony<br>Cutesy <br>Shiny reflective chrome<br>White sterile medical ascetic <br>Industrial - pipes everywhere<br>Coloured panels<br>Glassy<br>Curved, rounded<br>Hard, edged, polygonal<br>Organic<br>Military<br>Rustbucket future<br>naval vessels in space<br>asymmetric<br>symmetric<br>gothic (looking at you WH40K)<br>insectlike<br>antenna man's paradise<br>present day earthlike (space shuttle)<br><br><br>Of
 these I'm not sure yet...but given I can't stand the sight of cartoony 
or cutesy crap on mobile that's right out...can't stand those big eyes 
with blue spiky hair and pixar style rendered junk<br><br>(don't particularly like the shiny chrome stuff either)<br><br>That's probably enough for a first worklog.....<br><br>Time to do some research....lots of time spent watching the Battle of Endor lately....... <br><br> <a href="http://mattiesgames.com/" target="_blank"><img src="3317&amp;log=1905_files/banner2a.jpg"></a><br><a href="http://mattiesgames.com/articles/index.html" target="_blank">About Me</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
