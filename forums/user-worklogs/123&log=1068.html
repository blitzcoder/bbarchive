 now I did some incouraging test, so I can actually map the level with 
path nodes, which will be later used by the pathfinding routine. <br><br>I'm
 trying to keep the node matrix as small as possible, because the 
pathfinding could really slow down a game when lots of processing is 
required. <br><br>So far, I then achieved this goals (testing one unit only): <br><br>- the unit goes from any start point to any end point following the nodes guidance. <br><br>-
 if a building is built on the map, the node matrix is updated so that 
the next time a path is requested, it will take in account the building <br><br>-
 if a unit follows the path, and a building is built on that path, then 
the covered nodes are deleted, and substituted by a new path (small 
path) which will re-assemble the truncated path. The node matrix is also
 updated accordingly. <br><br>Something I have learned: <br><br>I had to
 check if the placed building covers one or more nodes. Both are 3D 
cubes - a big one for the building, small ones for nodes. <br><br>First,
 I've tryed with the built-in 3D collision engine, but I had troubles to
 determine all the nodes which have been touched by the building. Seems 
that CountCollisions does not really make the job I need in this case. <br><br>So, what has really helped me was.. 2D collisions ! <br><br>Yes, doing just a RectOverlap between the building and node rectangles did the trick. <br><br>The two rectangles was: <br>- the one related to the building, and <br>- the one related to the node. <br><br>I needed to adjust the width and height of such rectangles, because it really depends on how each 3D entity are scaled. <br><br>For the 2D position of the rectangles, I could just easily use the entityX() and entityZ() values of the 3D entities. <br><br>And...
 bingo ! It works like a charm, so combining 2D collisions with 3D 
object not only is possible, but gives also much more controls - for 
example, with 2D collisions I have achieved a non-response 3D collision 
in a very elegant way.<br> <br><br> <a href="http://www.sergiomarcello.com/" target="_blank">Games, Tutorials and More</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Top Secret - 1</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2003-08-18)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> --- Description.<br><br>Top Secret would be a Real Time Stragegy (RTS) game.<br><br>Players will set up their own base on a map (in a 3D ortographic view), build vehicles, units and structure.<br><br>The map is covered by a FOW (Fog Of War), and it's only revealed when units go through it.<br><br>There will also be a 2D radar which will help the player to go through the map.<br><br>The aim of the game is to defeat the opponent(s), or play in cooperative mode to defeat other human or PC controlled teams.<br><br>--- Version History<br><br>-- Middle July 2003 -- Version: The very beginning.

 very first version used connected waypoints, which have their 
connection rules pre-calculated in a table. To find a route, the unit 
only has to follow the nodes found in the table.<br><br>It was indeed a good method, but limited in some crucial aspect.<br><br>In
 fact, the waypoint network is static, thus it does not allow 
alternative path, and neither helps when a waypoint is not reachable 
because a building was mounted on it.<br> <br><br> <a href="http://www.sergiomarcello.com/" target="_blank">Games, Tutorials and More</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Dangerous Robots</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2002-07-18)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Pathfinding tests...<br> <br><br> <a href="http://www.sergiomarcello.com/" target="_blank">Games, Tutorials and More</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Dangerous Robots</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2002-07-02)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Learning nice things about Blitz3D !<br><br>I've

 I've solved some glitches related to resetting some global variables; 
they were not reset at each new game start from the main menu.<br><br>Also,
 the 'which_tile_is_under' function needs a retouch, since it does not 
report the tile under the gilby with good precision sometime.<br><br>The problem is that the tiles moves smoothly, so the gilby could sometime be above both a core and a not core tile. 8P<br><br>In
 the same time, I want re-design the map, and make it more clean; 
perhaps this will also minimize the 'which_tile_is_under' glitch.<br><br>I
 will add also a starting stage, where the mirrored gilby is not active 
for the first three alien waves, to get the player used to the game 
itself, the map, and not worryed about entropy.<br><br>Also, the fps 
must be limited to, say, 40-50; right now I get 60, and the guy that is 
testing the game, gets up to 120 fps, which make the game unplayable !!!
 :-(<br><br>Hopefully the terrible lickers will be less aggressive, with
 a normal speed... otherwise, I will change their A.I. to be more 'kind'
 with the gilby...(killing gilby softly ?.. ;-)<br><br>Beside this, the 
game runs very smooth. I've added also some nice sound effects, and I 
want try to add some "atmosphere" to the game, so to hear something even
 when gilby does not shoot or isn't hit; wind, for example, or something
 similar, would make the job.<br><br>A nice improvement could be also to change sound effects in each planet, so to make the game more alive and original each time.<br><br>The same behaviour I want apply to the 5 bonus stages, so to have a different atmosphere in each one.<br><br>Tweaking the game now gives me lots of pleasure, as well as I've got while coding it...<br><br>And I have to admit that the testing sessions  become often real challenges, and I forget what I was testing for... LOL !<br><br>I want officially thank Myke-P for his support and graphic help, and Mark Rayson for beta testing and kind suggestions.<br><br>Ciao,<br>Sergio.<br> <br><br> <a href="http://www.sergiomarcello.com/" target="_blank">Games, Tutorials and More</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
