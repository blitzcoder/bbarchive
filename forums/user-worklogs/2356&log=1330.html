 Im starting/doing some tools for interaction with game objects which

 let me work out where the player can/should be around a chest for

kick of the chest open animation and based on the type of chest, the 
players chest open animation.<br>This is allowing me to have proper

 After a lot of reading and more learning, im understanding alot of 
wrong things i had done by having game relevant stuff in the engine.<br>I
 have now totally removed it all now so it is like a basic game engine 
with nothing else, you have to do everything gameplay related in the 
scripting.<br><br>This allows a ton of freedom and ease of use.<br>All 
stuff like collisions and response is still engine specific as it avoids
 the user having to mess with all the hard stuff ie creating a character
 and getting world responses, with user tweaking still an option.<br><br>Now i can create scripts for things ie 3rd person cameras etc and allow them to be used without having to hardcode them. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>day 1</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-07-25)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Started work on a new 3d tile engine which will allow upto 500*500 
grids of 3d tiles each  1 unit width/depth, u can have 1000*1000 at good
 fps but takes forever to load and unload and memory usage is

 One thing that alot of new users have trouble with is a save/load 
system for their games, so i decided to code a system that will save out
 all blitz entities and restore them exactly how they were on saving ie 
colors, alpha, hidden etc.<br>The system builds on blitzs and allows 
creation of new entities and loading and unloading them along with 
deleting and hiding them.<br><br>The system is rapidly growing and although has many bugs works pretty well.<br><br>Im
 just trying to implement restoring of an animated mesh with the correct
 animation and frame and running of exactly from the last frame it was 
saved at. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Revamp..</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-06-03)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Done some more reading up on oop and obp.<br>I've been concenrating on get my code neater and more efficient and have given everything a major revamp.<br><br>All entities in the engine are used in a object-based style and now it has made everything simple.<br><br>Im using a blitz style entity system but have expanded on it.<br>You
 can create lights, cameras and pivots similar to blitz but now have new
 types such as characters, doors, houses/buildings, placeables have been
 added.<br>This allows proper freedom from the restrictive way i had before.<br><br>The benifit is you can create a character entity as part of your own type group instead of being limited.<br><br><pre class="code">;a user created type
;which allows what you want
Type TMonster
 field name$
 field age%
 ;the 3d entity for your monster
 field model.TEntity
end type

Then you would do this

ThisMonster.TMonster = new TMonster
ThisMonster\name$ = "warlock"
ThisMonster\age% = 192
ThisMonster\model = NewEntity_Character.TEntity("warlock");sets up a default character TEntity
Load_Entity(ThisMonster\model);load the entities 3d stuff
Scale_Entity(ThisMonster\model,1,1,1)
Rotate_Entity(ThisMonster\model,0,90,0)
</pre><br><br>Now, why is this so great? Well, all you need to do for a 
character in your game is that, no messing about setting up collisions, 
animations, children etc<br>You have a predefined n/pc, now give it some ai/input and of you go.<br>You can also load/unload each entity at will <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>another break through</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-05-23)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> After hours of headaches i finally made another break through.<br>I
 already had edge climbing in but it was hacked because of how 
animations work in blitz where if you translate the entities origin in 
the 3d app it would always snap back to the original position at the end
 of the frame to the start frames origin.<br>Now it works great, if you grab an edge you climb it ala zelda/mario and position perfectly at the top of the edge! <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Just changed the collision setup</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-05-20)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Previously you had to name each part of the level as ground, wall etc

 the level and all collisions and responses will work thanks to some

 revamped the character engine part and made it even simpler to use. You
 can change alot of the way a character feels and moves ie you can 
create a little nimble dude like mario or a big slow beast like bowser, 
it's simple!!<br><br>Been working more on parts of the editor too and have the framework complete, now im adding stuff for character creation.<br><br>The
 actual way you create a character will be the same for both a pc and 
npc, it allows you to test how the npc/monster may move and what 
advantages/disadvantages it may gain ie give a small enemy fast accel

 The editor is coming along great. I created the framework for it and 
adding stuff is now very simple, im onto the character part so far, 
loading, saving and creating actors and maps is in thus far.<br><br>Im not planning on allowing level/map creation, just loading of precreated ones made with your own apps.<br>You just need to stick to naming standards ie walkable surfaces as "TYPE_GROUND" etc<br><br>The
 reason for this is because i can't do anything better than what is 
already out and don't want to, although i did create a basic 3d tile 
engine with raising/lowering, painting of paths etc. The problem is it 
all looked to square/generic and adding tiles was tedious.<br><br>More soon... <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>busy busy</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-04-28)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Had a free day today so i've been hard at work coding.<br><br>I've sorted many classes out for game objects, so far i have:<br><br>Characters - these can be pc, npc/monsters etc<br><br>Active placeables - these can be anything really like chests, trees, tables, chairs etc<br><br>Static
 placeables - these are exactly that, the same as active except they 
don't do anything, no animation, scripts etc. Can be used for trees etc 
and help performance.<br><br>Buildings - these have door elements where 
you can attach doors and a trigger returning when you enter/leave. I am 
still unsure how i'm gonna do these - <br>A) Went you enter the house you load the interior/map<br>B)The house has all interior elements loaded and obscuring walls/roofs just alpha out to allow you to see in.<br><br>Although i could just leave this open with both choices!<br><br>Doors - These are attached to buildings and can be opened/closed, locked, attacked, destroyed.<br>They can also be attached to other objects which possess a door element ie part of a cage or fence<br><br>Item - Basically an item, which has a name, world mesh and a icon. The rest is upto the scripter e.g<br><br>used in OnUsed scripts of items:<br><br>If GetItemUsed$() = "HealthPotion"<br> SetStatistic(user,"health",GetStatistic(user,"health")+10)<br> sprite = Copy_3DSprite(Sprite_HealthUp);a preloaded sprite<br> Set_Velocity_3DSprite sprite,0,.1,0;set its movement rate<br> Set_AlphaMod_3DSprite sprite,-.01;set how fast it fadesout<br> Set_Mode_3DSprite sprite,MODE_FADEOUT<br> position_3DSprite,x#,y#,z#;position of user<br>endif<br><br>You
 can also add statistics to the item such as "Health" and a value and it
 will automatically increase any stats which match on the user instead 
of having to script it eg<br><br>First you would give actors a new stat eg<br><br>AddStat_Character(ThisActor.TActor,"HP",desc$="",value_Int%=0,value_float#=0.0,value_string$="")<br><br>Then add the same stat to an item eg<br><br>AddStat_Item(ThisItem.TItem,"HP",desc$="",10,value_float#=0.0,value_string$="")<br><br>now
 when ever the item is used it will look for the stat on the user and 
increase/decrease the values .

 it simple and fun to use was important and having just one main script 
or includes for scripts for each entity seemed painful(u still can of 
course)<br><br>I've decided to run individual scripts based on 
events/actions in game for each entity, meaning? Each entity has its own
 set of scripts for each event:-<br><br>OnHeartBeat; This script will 
run continously(unless it bogs performance) for all loaded and active 
entities ie npcs, placeables, maps.<br><br>OnConversation: Whenever this npc is put into conversation, wether they initiated it or not, the script will run<br><br>OnActivate:
 This can be used when the activate key is selected near the entity, 
uses could be to open a chest, check an npc characters stats, attempt a 
pickpocket etc<br><br>OnPerception: This script is run for the npc when the npc sees you. May add if they hear you to :)<br>You can have an enemy run at you and attack you.<br><br>OnDamaged: Runs when the entity takes damage<br><br>OnDeath: is run when the entity is killeddestroyed. Allows you to leave an item behind or a corpse etc<br><br>OnExitMap: This script will run whenever the npc leaves a map.<br><br>In the script you would do:<br><br>select MapExited(self)<br><br>case "home village"<br><br>dostuff()<br><br>case "city"<br><br>dostuff2()<br><br>end select<br><br>OnEnterMap: see OnExitMap<br><br>Their will be more scripts for lots of other events.<br>Some are still attached on entities and others global such as camera control.<br><br>I still have alot of planning to do and decide what is hardcoded and what isn't.<br>Their
 are many different versions on my comp with different approaches which i
 keep going back to and improving and seeing if they are better or 
worse. Hopefully i will come to a definite list which i can then start 
working on 100%<br><br>p.s.

 Im a big fan of nintendo games ie zelda, mario and rpg games and always
 wished someone would mix the 2 ie a deep rpg with the controls of a 3d 
platformer.<br>Games like morrowind left me feeling dissappointed cos 
the character control sucked and stuff like nwn was really point and 
click.<br><br>I've been working on many demos over the years to get my 
skills up to create my vision and things are finally falling into place 
thanks to blitz.<br><br>The engine will allow me to make a game similar 
to mario64/zelda64(i class this as a action-adventure) ie the controls 
and worlds but within a rpg style game ie towns and interactive npcs, 
stats, a deep story where you do quests, collect items and powerup.<br>The whole system ie controls, camera, ai, etc is all run through scripts and can easily be modified.<br><br>All
 entities in the engine are actors which have their own class ie pc,npc,
 container/chest, door, house, startpoint, checkpoint, leveljump so can 
almost have the same functions applied to them ie like blitz entities.<br><br>The
 pc and npc class both can be given the same instructions ie walk, run, 
jump, climb, attack, open a door/chest, initiate dialogue which makes 
them feel real instead of their for show and can have inventories, use 
items and interact with the world.<br><br>The engine has shadows from 
sswift, uses nuclear glory collisions with many a hack to allow some 
cools features in my engine, my own single surface system, bvm for 
scripting, my own pathfinding system based of djekstra, plus some other 
stuff i forget.<br><br>Im hoping to get something made with it as it's taken along time to get it to where it is now.<br><br>My
 rig, athlon 1600+, gf4200ti and 512mb ram, allows me to have 25 npcs 
with ai and collisions, run around at 60fps in a basic level all boned 
and highish poly 700-3000.<br>Obviously it will be a lot less within a fully running level. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
