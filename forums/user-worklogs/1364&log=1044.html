 and I have been working on our scripting system (for missions) - 
although we haven't actually got any code written up, we have been 
designing the syntax. We want this to be as easy to learn and to read. I
 have written a sample script, using the convensions we designed. Some 
time we will have to write the scripting system itself, but I have a 
feeling it may not be until we have nearly finished the game - it is 
easier to write the scripting system if you have something to script :)<br><br>So,
 I have started on the movement system. We both wrote a few test 
versions before I started writing this version. I wanted to get a head 
start on him, because I had this way of coding which I wanted to prove 
to him :) Now I have a nice movement system, in which I can put a load 
of ships, each with their own speeds etc. I have a nice system so that 
for example, if you have a ship: s.ships = new ships, you can assign it 
as the player's by simply saying "player = s" and the camera will be 
updated and everythin', but your old ship will continue to move at its 
own speed. To think that Neil wanted to use global variables such as 
"playerXSpeed" :) (sorry neil :D )<br><br>The next step I believe will 
be the particle system which I will integrate into the movement system 
from stage 1. The question is, will I use different systems for the 
projectile/particle systems? Particle system are for things like smoke 
effects etc, and projectile system are for things like weapon fire, and 
flying pieces of destroyed ships. Once that is done, then I can work on 
things such as damage and collision. What happens after that? Well, I 
could start on AI :)<br><br>--Phish<br> <br><br> --Phish<br><a href="http://www.josephcreates.com/" target="_blank">Joseph Humfrey Online Portfolio</a>, <a href="http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~phish/elizabeth/" target="_blank">Elizabeth Goddard</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Improved Galaxies</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2001-11-23)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Well, I have continued to work hard on my galaxy generator, which 
displays a randomly generated galaxy in full 3D. In the game, it will be
 used as the 3D map, so that you can move between stars.<br><br>I have 
fully implemented mouse movement with the right button and scroll wheel 
(for zoom). It is completely smoothly with acceleration values rather 
than just velocities. Also, I cut out a large segment of stars from the 
center of the galaxy which were slowing down the program enormously. Now
 there is a pretty glowing ball there to represent the dense mass of 
stars. In fact, I think I prefer this faster method to the slower, more 
complex method, so all in all, it is pretty damn gorgeous, though I say 
so myself :-)<br><br>Also, Neil and I have been working on the PCS or 
"public content system". Perhaps this name is becoming outdated, but at 
the same time, it is sticking, so probably won't change. We are working 
out the directories within the content directory of the game, and from 
there we can work out the data structures (types). It'll be pretty 
important, because as soon as the game hierarchies are worked out, we 
can code anything which relies on game content without worries, as well 
as create the content itself!<br><br>Ship design and modelling 
continues... I have been asking for advice from friends as to what kinds
 of designs there should be. I want the ships to be innovative, but more
 importantly, very cool looking. :-)<br> <br><br> --Phish<br><a href="http://www.josephcreates.com/" target="_blank">Joseph Humfrey Online Portfolio</a>, <a href="http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~phish/elizabeth/" target="_blank">Elizabeth Goddard</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>First Entry!</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2001-11-15)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Well, I've decided to use this system on BlitzBasic.com - I thought it 
seemed like a nice idea, and useful for keeping track of my work. I'm 
going to use it to keep track of my part in the development of a game, 
which is being developed by me and a friend from school. It is basically
 a 3D space exploration/trading/action game.<br><br>Here is what I have accomplished up to this point:<br><br>* Most aspects of the game have been designed, if not on paper, then in my head :-)<br>*
 I got a landscape trial to work - I decided to use it for the 
background when landing on a planet. It's going to be used for little 
more than eyecandy, and to give the whole landing lark an aesthetically 
pleasing taste... or something.<br>* I have been working on my nice 
dynamic 3D GUI system. Neil and I have been trying to work out how to 
make it so that you can click on buttons. The windows are all 3D 
sprites, so it will be quite complicated to work out.<br>* I made a 
galaxy generator, and now it has been fully implemented into 3D, 
including nice clouds of stars. However, it runs quite slowly with any 
more than 2000 stars, and below that threshold, the whole thing looks 
crappy, and to be blunt, not worth while.<br>* I have modelled quite a few of the ships already!
