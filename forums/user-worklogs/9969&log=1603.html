 basic idea is that the player ship will have a fixed priority of 1 
(updates every frame).  AI ships nearby will have a high priority too, 
but ships further out will have lower update priorities. Space objects 
very far away will have a priority of, say, 16 or so. And objects that 
only move but do not think (asteroids, planets etc.) should probably 
update at a fixed lower priority rate. That way I could increase the 
amount of physics entities dramatically without adverse effects to the 
game performace.<br><br><br>How this integrates to the current collision
 detection engine, I have no idea. The current engine requires that both
 colliding objects have updated before collision respose can be 
calculated properly. So I might have some trouble in implementing this 
one. Oh well, life without challenges wouldn't be that exciting, right?<br><br>The
 technical way to implement this is still a bit obscure. Maybe I should 
have 3 or 4 lists with fixed priority values, and dynamically move the 
objects between the lists as they move closer to or futher from the 
player. Also, I need an elegant way to make sure that the objects in a 
16-frame priority list are not all updated during the same frame, but 
smooth them out to span all 16 frames. <br><br>All of this makes me think of...<br><br><br><b>Timing</b><br><br>Now there's a beast that requires a total rewrite. But why?<br><br>Having
 played around with fixed time step and fathomed out the pros and cons 
of fixed and variable time steps, I'm slowly coming to the conclusion 
that it's definitely worth trying.<br><br>First off, I believe 
implementing those priority lists I talked about above is possible only 
using a fixed dt, without the need to save the last update time with 
every object.<br>Secondly, there's a fair chance that my struggles with 
degrading planetary orbits are over after this decision. I knew from the
 beginning that variable physics step is a big no-no for the 
inaccuracies it causes.<br><br>Unfortunately it will be a hell of a job 
at this point of the project. There's a lot of logic in the game relying
 on the current delta timer, so it might require some hacking and shaky 
duct tape fixing to get everything in working order.<br><br>Or then again it might be better for me to abandon Ananta and join the Vega Strike team... ;) <br><br> --------------------------------<br>2d space sim in progress: <a href="http://anantagame.googlepages.com/" target="_blank">Ananta</a><br>Worklog <a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/logs/userlog.php?user=9969&amp;log=1603" target="_blank">here</a><br><a href="http://code.google.com/p/ananta/updates/list" target="_blank">Code updates</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Fly-by-wire</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-04-26)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Remember <i>Independence War 2</i> and <i>Terminus</i>?
 They were space sims that had beautiful Newtonian physics and still 
managed to be a lot of fun. They can easily be mutually exclusive if not
 done right.<br><br>Let's face it: Elite Frontier was innovative and 
extremely realistic, but as a result, space flight and combat were dead 
boring. Those games that do it right have some kind of an artificial 
velocity limiter that bend some laws of nature but manage to get away 
with it as space <i>sims</i>. <br><br>Ananta's latest SVN incarnation 
features a fly-by-wire computer that controls velocity in a very subtle 
manner, without actually breaking any laws of physics. I came up with a 
hull-specific top velocity after which the hull starts to gradually take
 damage. Speeding is controlled by the ship's computer, which controls 
directional thrusters to keep the ship's velocity under the hull's speed
 limit. The limiter can be momentarily switched off for those quick 
escapes, trading some of the ship's integrity for the pilot's life.<br><br>In
 a technical side, it took a lot of thinking and trigonometry to pull it
 off in an elegant manner, but the results look quite good. The 
directional thrusters do their best to bring a speeding ship below the 
speed limit without crippling the pilot's control over his ship.<br><br>Those fly-by-wire functions should help tremendously with coding in some advanced AI routines as well. <br><br> --------------------------------<br>2d space sim in progress: <a href="http://anantagame.googlepages.com/" target="_blank">Ananta</a><br>Worklog <a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/logs/userlog.php?user=9969&amp;log=1603" target="_blank">here</a><br><a href="http://code.google.com/p/ananta/updates/list" target="_blank">Code updates</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Wingmen!</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-03-28)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 It's really not a simple task to code AI logic for Newtonian space 
flight. After hours of pouring through physics books and sites in search
 for useful equations, and failing countless times trying totally 
different approaches to tackle the problem, I finally bumped into a 
forum thread that presented a simple yet surprisingly effective idea for
 AI chase logic.<br><br>To put it simply: predict the coordinates of 
your ship and the target at some time in the future, draw an imaginary 
vector between those two predicted points in space and accelerate in 
parallel to the vector. The trick is knowing how to calculate the 
prediction time interval for it to work at all speeds and distances.<br><br>The
 result is far from optimal control, but in a game like this it comes 
close enough. If it looks good enough, use it. After all, we're not JPL 
engineers coding an autopilot logic for Mars landers.<br><br>So, the current SVN revision (140) now features a wingman who does his best to follow your ship. <br><br>Next up: combat flight AI. <br><br> --------------------------------<br>2d space sim in progress: <a href="http://anantagame.googlepages.com/" target="_blank">Ananta</a><br>Worklog <a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/logs/userlog.php?user=9969&amp;log=1603" target="_blank">here</a><br><a href="http://code.google.com/p/ananta/updates/list" target="_blank">Code updates</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Solar system</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-03-20)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> By the way, here's a sneak peek at what the solar system generator is producing right now.<br><br><img src="9969&amp;log=1603_files/solarsystem.webp"><br><br>In case you're wondering, that view kicks in if the galaxy map zoomed in enough. :) <br><br> --------------------------------<br>2d space sim in progress: <a href="http://anantagame.googlepages.com/" target="_blank">Ananta</a><br>Worklog <a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/logs/userlog.php?user=9969&amp;log=1603" target="_blank">here</a><br><a href="http://code.google.com/p/ananta/updates/list" target="_blank">Code updates</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Trigonometry</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-03-19)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> I knew I should've not skipped those lessons. <br><br> --------------------------------<br>2d space sim in progress: <a href="http://anantagame.googlepages.com/" target="_blank">Ananta</a><br>Worklog <a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/logs/userlog.php?user=9969&amp;log=1603" target="_blank">here</a><br><a href="http://code.google.com/p/ananta/updates/list" target="_blank">Code updates</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Progress</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-03-14)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Ok, it's been a while.<br><br>The
 project has not progressed much since the last worklog entry. And to 
make it even more embarrasing, most of the credit for the progress goes

push.<br><br>He coded in a well-working procedural planet generator that
 is fired on entrance to the solar system and populates the system with

your heart's content.<br><br>Right now I'm putting together some 
primitive AI routines, and I expect to see some combat action soon. 
Also, the plan is to make the static planets orbit their suns. After 
preliminary testing I still have trouble keeping the moons' orbits 
stable enough for the simulation. Maybe delta timer wasn't the proper 
choice for a timing method after all :P<br><br>I'm quite thrilled about 
the latest great advance in BlitzMax: threading. A project of this scale
 can surely benefit from it as soon as I get my head around it. <br><br> --------------------------------<br>2d space sim in progress: <a href="http://anantagame.googlepages.com/" target="_blank">Ananta</a><br>Worklog <a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/logs/userlog.php?user=9969&amp;log=1603" target="_blank">here</a><br><a href="http://code.google.com/p/ananta/updates/list" target="_blank">Code updates</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Why not 3d?</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2008-05-18)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> I've had numerous ravings from disappointed Elite fans about this game done in 2d, so I thought to clear it up a bit.<br><br>With
 the help of free 3rd party modules, BlitzMax is very capable of doing 
fast and visually appealing 3d. Still, I chose 2d. Why?<br><br>Yes, it's
 2d, yet I have the nerve to compare it to Elite. So go ahead and sue 
me. Visual appearance aside, keeping the game in 2d has many benefits 
over 3d. <br><br>Ananta started out as a one-man-project and will 
probably stay that way for some time, at least until I get the game on 
tracks to let it evolve by itself. 3d would mean that I'd be dependent 
on a scarce resource of 3d modellers. Unfortunately I have neither the 
skill, talent, will nor time to learn it by myself. <br><br>On top of 
that, there really are no modellers out there willing to participate in a
 casual on/off project which occasionally might not show any progress 
for a long time. For free, might I add. Even getting a talented 2d pixel
 artist or two to take part in this could prove to be difficult. <br><br>Most
 importantly, 2d allows more freedom in game design. The intention is to
 focus on the immersion of a huge, dynamic and living universe, instead 
of polishing the glossy visual aspects of 1st person action. Keeping it 
simple allows me to concentrate on things I feel are most important. I 
will need every CPU cycle I can squeeze off to simulate the physics and 
economy of the underlying universe, and in spite of what modern 
computers are capable of, doing everything in 3d would consume more CPU 
time and memory. <br><br>To sum it all up, as a man with a day-job (and a
 life, mind you ;), I feel Ananta development already consumes more than
 enough of my spare time. I barely have the time to commit to a project 
of this scale, let alone to a full-blown 3d space sim. <br><br> --------------------------------<br>2d space sim in progress: <a href="http://anantagame.googlepages.com/" target="_blank">Ananta</a><br>Worklog <a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/logs/userlog.php?user=9969&amp;log=1603" target="_blank">here</a><br><a href="http://code.google.com/p/ananta/updates/list" target="_blank">Code updates</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Procedurally generated galaxy teaser</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2008-05-08)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> <b>Starmap zoomed up on a "star sector":</b><br><br><img src="9969&amp;log=1603_files/starmap2_1.webp"><br><br>The star names are generated by randomly combining three syllables together. <br><br><b>A bit zoomed out...:</b><br><br><img src="9969&amp;log=1603_files/starmap2_2.webp"><br><br><br><br><b>"My God, it's full of stars!":</b><br><br><img src="9969&amp;log=1603_files/starmap2_3.webp"><br><br><br><b>Galaxy image kicking in when zoomed out far enough:</b><br><br><img src="9969&amp;log=1603_files/starmap2_4.webp"><br><br><img src="9969&amp;log=1603_files/starmap2_5.webp"><br><br><br>The

 Ananta is a 2d, single-player Elite-like trading/combat/exploring space
 adventure game. I'm taking influences from the best of the space 
trading games, but still try to create something unique. It will combine
 the best features from Elite II Frontier, Flatspace, X-series, 
Terminus, Hardwar and Starshatter, to name a few. Each of those games 
excel in one or two categories, but none of them doesn't fit my idea of a
 perfect game of this genre. Well, Ananta will not be perfect either. 
Not without a huge budget and a team of hired developers, <b>or</b> a motivated group of talented open-source coders.

 Now that the project has been under development on and off for almost 
two years now (mostly "off" during the first year), a real game is 
slowly starting to rise from the loose heaps of random code. So, I 
finally decided to start a worklog as the game has progressed beyond the
 infamous <i>point of no return</i>, where the amount of invested time and effort is getting too huge for me to chicken out anymore. <br><br>Actually
 the project started some three years ago, but not originally with 
BlitzMax but another game-oriented marginal language. Some two years ago
 I decided to port the little code I had to BlitzMax. It's been a 
really, really slow project, mainly because the damned Real Life ™ 
getting on my way. You know, the day job, spouse, drinking with buddies,
 etc. Now I've picked up the pace, and I believe this worklog might 
actually make me push even harder, now that I know there might be people
 out there expecting to see some results. :) Right now, the codebase has
 almost 4000 lines or 130000 characters of self-written code, not 
counting comments or empty lines. Everything critical to the game, 
including the physics engine, is 100% homemade. A small helping hand 
from Brucey in the form of the XML file parser wrapper and Cairo vector 
graphics module has been needed, though ;)<br><br>The game is free and 
open-source, and will remain that way. The source code repository and 
some ideas about the game development can be found at the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ananta/" target="_blank">Google Code site</a>. <br><br>The
 repository commit log acts as a really detailed "worklog" for the game 
(not that I expect anyone to actually browse through it!), so this 
worklog will be mainly my channel to shamelessly promote my development 
milestones. <br><br>While I'm pondering what parts of the game to 
shamelessly promote, go ahead and see what the Google Code site has to 
offer. The Subversion repository is free for anyone to checkout, compile
 and run. The game doesn't use any commercial 3rd party modules, so it 
should be a breeze. Also it should compile on Linux and Mac as well, 
although it's been a while since I tried compiling it on Ubuntu. Throw 
me a message if it doesn't. <br><br> --------------------------------<br>2d space sim in progress: <a href="http://anantagame.googlepages.com/" target="_blank">Ananta</a><br>Worklog <a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/logs/userlog.php?user=9969&amp;log=1603" target="_blank">here</a><br><a href="http://code.google.com/p/ananta/updates/list" target="_blank">Code updates</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
