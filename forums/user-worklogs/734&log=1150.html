 Well 2004 has not been as a productive year as we hoped. Many factors 
had a part to play, such as real-life stuff, summer etc... <br><br>So 
where do we go from here? Well we had been working on an action-rpg 
title, however we now feel that our current level of enthusiasm for this
 kind of game is not all there, and as most of you will know, if you 
don't feel like doing something then don't waste anymore time on it as 
it will never be done properly. So we are starting a new project 
something a little more on familiar more interesting ground :)<br><br>However
 I'm not about to say what we are working on now as there are many 
discussions ahead for us about the direction we want it to go in. The 
main reason for this worklog is just to make sure I get one in during 
2004 and to say that we aren't MIA, just been resting on our lorals for a
 while :)<br><br>Mike (Sunteam Software)<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Sunteam - quietly does it.</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2003-11-18)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Quietness from the Sunteam camp abounds at the moment, but that is not 
to say we aren't working hard. Programming wise it is a strange time as 
we have so far proven various technologies and techniques but now it 
seems we are finally at the beginning. Why is that strange you say? Well
 it's just that we started this project back before the summer and 
having programmed a demo level, various screen artifacts and effects we 
are now starting on the coding proper.<br><br>Funnily enough this is 
more exciting now than it was back then. Why? Because we are finally 
putting the building blocks together to form the underlying engine of 
the game and despite having not too much to show right now the overrall 
outcome is looking more and more like a class product. Surprisingly easy
 to do now as well... which is nice :)<br><br>So is there anything new 
to tout? Well the action part of the game is definately going to be more
 pronounced than originally invisioned but we think this will help to 
boost the appeal of the game as nobody wants to walk around for ages and
 do nothing, so as well as having a grand story with appropriate 
settings and mood, the player will be hacking and slashing their way 
through the story.<br><br>There are of course many things we will be 
putting into this game and there are lots of ideas floating around too. 
However history dictates we keep a lid on these for now, otherwise we'll
 have nothing to shout about when it is released :p<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>First 3D game development under way</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2003-03-21)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Having spent a lot of time on the UniMake programs we have learnt a lot
 about 3D programming and various techniques which we now know we can 
utilise in any future projects we work on. However UniMake was heading 
inevitably in the wrong direction so we have decided to ditch it in 
favour of already established programs out there.<br><br>In the last few weeks we have begun work on our first 3D game which will be a RPG. Progress so far:<br><br>-Storyline worked out<br>-Graphical style under development<br>-Game engine being worked on<br>-Utilisation of tools commences building up a core set from which to advance the progress into full development<br><br>As
 for the actual game mechanics, we are aiming for a 3rd person 3d 
environment with realtime combat with customised attacks utilising 
varying weapons throughout the story. Environments will span various 
differing styles including villages, forests, mountains and underground 
areas such as caves and dungeons. As the story is set in a fantasy 
world, their will be many creatures to fight and magic may also play a 
part.<br><br>Technical progress:<br><br>So far we have been looking at 
the overall style of graphics as well as working out the best use of 
available software. This has mostly concentrated on outdoor environments
 for which we use MojoWorld v2.0 (http://www.pandromeda.com). We have 
created a bare bones world from which we can export heightmap and 
texturemap information from any area within that world which we then use
 WorldSpin to layout in a Blitz environment. Results are better than 
expected and progress is seemingly straight forward. As my graphical guy
 concentrates on the overall visual styles of the game I am now working 
on the raw game engine for which I'm currently concentrating on the game
 area code, camera and player control code, and the connecting of 
different areas/maps which the player will be able to move around in.<br><br>As we get to the point of finalising the graphical style we may then begin to post some screenshots. Until then, happy coding :)<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>2D Demo done!</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2002-08-28)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 The 2D Tech Demo is done and available for download from our webby. The
 3D Tech Demo will not be finished in it's current incarnation but we do
 have plans for it :)<br><br>Currently going to finish 'Bentens Jetbike Challenge' and 'Harrier Angel' and then it's onto 3D work.<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Cybernoid finished and...</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2002-05-20)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> ...we had a spare day so we did our first 3D title which went better than we could have hoped for.<br><br>Cybernoid:
 Full remake with intro and end sequences. Extras galore which you get 
by collecting Daruma collectable tokens and spending them accordingly in
 the Extra's section (Psssst the last extra is well worth it if you can 
get it, plus it alters the ending slightly).<br><br>Brass in the Brine: 
Call it a little test game if you will. Pilot your submersible around 
the underwater terrain finding and destroying treasure chest within the 
time limit. Nothing fancy just a 3D test really but good fun :)<br><br>Both can be had from our <a href="http://www.sunteamsoftware.co.uk/" target="_blank">webby</a><br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
