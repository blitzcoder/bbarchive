 Another flash of inspiration, another idea for a game. It's a lot 
different than my last game ROY (a block puzzle game) but I'm not saying
 too much. I've got a small test bed up and running and I am pretty sure
 it's possible. I'm just working out the finer points of the physics

 I've finally added high score tables to my game! This was more hard 
work than I imagined, juggling numbers and strings and having to write 
"zero padding" functions to convert the likes of "10" to "00010". Now, 
the menu system is more complicated than the game!<br><br>HELP ME: Reports on what scores you get in each mode on your first and best tries would be very handy.<br><br>I've
 also been working on a small app to demonstrate my network code. This 
works, but uses UDP, though for ROY I could actually make do with TCP. 
The app posts it's IP to my server if no slots are available, or starts 
comms if there's one listed free. Blitz makes this really easy - thanks

 ROY has had a few small updates over the last week, mainly cosmetic 
changes and paving the way for the different game modes. Hopefully this 
week will see the introduction of Puzzle mode and finalising of the 
timing of the various gameplay elements.<br><br>I also found a nice 
JavaScript tutorial on matching block shapes in a strange block puzzle

 been working on a little (you'll see why later) puzzle game to get back
 into the Blitz scene. Life turned a bit hairy this time last year and I
 lost all momentum to do anything, so my two projects: Simple Soccer and
 Bendertron were put on hold.<br><br>So, last month I had a weird dream 
about a puzzle game. Work was, and still isn't, too busy so I wrote down
 all my thoughts in a notebook for the next two weeks or so.<br><br>At 
this point I knocked up a quick, text mode(!) engine to test the concept
 and prove it's worth to myself. To be honest though, I wasn't 
convinced, until I dropped in some coloured graphics. Further to this, 
when I had the dream it was on a Gameboy Advance, so I mocked up the 
graphics at that resolution! It's all turning out somewhat SNES-ish, 
which makes me very happy indeed.<br><br>So, where are we now? Well, the
 game is in there, as are the majority of the graphics and some suitably
 small sounds. Gameplay and control tweaking carries on, my sound grasp 
of logic seems to have taken a temporary vacation.<br><br>I'd really 
like to only show a demo when it's got more refined gameplay and a 
couple of extra play modes. So there's no BlitzCoder showcase entry 
until then! The amount of support my little Soccer game got was, to be 
honest, overwhelming so I don't want to go there again just yet.<br><br>What
 remains to be done, long term? Well, Internet VS. mode, a comparatively
 *large* animated intro that I also dreamt up - to a song I've been 
listening a lot to lately... And to get this baby published on the GBA!<br><br>Sorry, I think that was another dream kicking in.<br><br>bye for now.<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
