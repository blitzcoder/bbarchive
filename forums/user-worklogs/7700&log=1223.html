 I can't seem to find a person with an intel mac for love nor money. 
Plan B was to wait till Leopard and buy myself a macbook, but now that 
is delayed along with the New OS...<br><br>So, until I can magic up a 
solution, I have been working on a couple of other utilities for Mac 
users, which should be ready to go a couple of weeks after the Virtual 
input release. To add to all this, I have had a very good idea for a 
cross platform utility which will most likely hold the release even 
further while I make a couple of proof of concepts...<br><br>Oh well, back to the grindstone. <br><br> If everything in life had a point.

 main thing lacking has been an intel mac os version and while I do not 
own an intel mac, I have managed to locate a friend with one. With any 
luck I will have a compiled app within a week or so.<br><br>In addition 
to this, a few improvements have been made, firstly the addition of a 
simple "move mouse" action, a bit of an oversight in hindsight. Next on 
the list is an extended set of shortcut commands, allowing easy access 
to the menu bar and the dock for the first time. However, the big 
advance in this release is the availability of "invisible execution". To
 explain, this allows the virtual input automator actions to be executed
 in the background without the need for a visible virtual machine. This 
solves all manner of problems regarding applications deactivating 
themselves during workflow execution, reducing the number of commands 
needed for a functioning workflow. This option will only be available to
 registered users, as 1) I am very pleased with it and 2) The software 
can easily be evaluated in "visible" mode and 3) It is a bit hard to 
register a background program that has no visible presence to the user.<br><br>With
 any luck this version will be as successful as the last, and here is 
hoping that Mac OS 10.5 doesn't include mouse and keyboard commands 
within automator! <br><br> If everything in life had a point.

I have beaten of my curse and actually finished a project! And it is actually quite usefull too.<br><br>Now
 I know it is done, I can start to talk about it without fear of 
slipping into Red Ocktober syndrome. (no offence, it was meant in jest 
;) )<br><br>All it needs now before being released is for the program to
 quit when the quit option in the program menu is selected. Which is 
easier said than done on the mac.<br><br>So, what is Automator Virtual input?<br><br>Automator
 Virtual input is a program and set of Automator actions (written in 
applescript) for Apple's Automator program released with Mac OS 10.4 . 
However, Automator is a little limited out of the box with relatively 
few actions avalible. This can be improved by downloading 3rd party 
actions from the net, but often this is not a solution. So, to be able 
to do everything the user is able to do, you need control of the mouse 
and keyboard and that is exactly what Automator Virtual Input allows you
 to do. <br><br> If everything in life had a point.

 After a few days hard slog, the first release is as ready as it will 
ever be. Its rought around the edges, but if I don't release it as it 
is, I might never get around to releasing it.<br><br>It supports 6 
programs to begin with, with the next release planing to support up to 
20+ poker programs and a better GUI if I'm up to the task.<br><br>The 
release price is $25 shareware with a time limited trial, which is 
pritty good when compared to many manual poker odds calculators, and 
much cheaper than most automatic recognition poker programs.<br><br>Features include:<br><br>- Automatic card recognition<br>- Odds on getting a hand in the remaining cards<br>- Rank of hold pre-flop<br>- Cards similar to your own pre-flop<br>- The number of hands better than yours, and how good they were pre flop <br>- Straight and Flush Warnings <br>- Manual Mode<br><br>Supported programs for first release:-<br><br>- Bet365<br>- Ladbrokes Poker<br>- Empire Poker<br>- Party Poker<br>- Paradise Poker<br>- Pacific Poker<br><br>It is avalible on my Blitzcoder page for the time being:- <br><br><a href="http://www.blitzcoder.com/cgi-bin/showcase/showcase_showentry.pl?id=ga08292004210138&amp;comments=no" target="_blank">http://www.blitzcoder.com/cgi-bin/showcase/showcase_showentry.pl?id=ga08292004210138&amp;comments=no</a><br><br><br>Please email me with any problems or just to tell me what you think at odds_on_support@...<br><br>Hope you enjoy it.<br><br>P.S.<br><br>I'll
 leave this up on my worklog for a couple of days to see how many people
 actualy read this before posting on the showcase forum. (And hopefuly a
 chance to catch bugs before a full release).<br> <br><br> If everything in life had a point.

 Finaly managed to cobble together a website (Expect a many many many 
spelling errors until I can fix them in the next couple of days). But 
there are a few screenshots on the website to see what the program is

 Advancing slowly. Glad to say that the odds calculation systems are 
just about completed, all that remians is a straight warning system 
which are also used by the "number of hands better than yours" 
calculation systems. <br><br>Still to be completed is the implemtation 
of sevral new poker programs for the image recon. systems. The list of 
programs suported for the release will be something like the following:<br><br>Empire Poker<br>Party Poker<br>Pacific Poker<br>Paradise Poker<br>Bet 365 poker (hopefuly, atm it is causing problems)<br>Plus 2 or 3 others which I have not got around to making media for yet. <br><br>If you have a sudgestion for a poker program you want supported, drop me a line and I'll see what I can do.<br><br>Hopefuly
 I will have a website up and running in a wee bit so the next time of

 Having advanced as far as I could with the demo version of blitz 3D, I 
finaly managed to purchase it (which is kinda strange, seeing this is a 
mainly 2D project, but I'm sure my urge to create a 3D slot car game 
will bair fruit one day, plus I've never been a fan of the windows API 
to justify buying BlitzPlus.) <br><br>Anyway, who am I? Well, I'm a 3rd 
year chemistry student from Scotland, who was doing computer science as 
well until I realised just how much I hated Java and the science of 
computing. So, while chemistry is what I realy enjoy, unless I go into 
the meth lab trade I don't have many income options for a student in 
dire need of pub..erm.. book money. Yes, I know it realy isn't the done 
thing to say "I'm in this for the money", but I am, its eiter this or 
flipping burgers. Enought said realy.<br><br>However, I have been a fan 
of BASIC, or basic style, programing lanuages and have been developing 
the Odds On project for the last couple of months on the blitz 3D demo. 
I've been using Dark basic for two and a half years, but it has its 
flaws and isn't realy the thing for aplications. Before that it was True
 Basic for 3 years. Now onto the project itself.<br><br>Having seen a 
few of the hack and slash VB efforts at programs which give users the 
odds on what the likelyhood of X card coming out, most of which require 
manual intervention, I figgered it might be worthwhile researching the 
topic and there are a few programs that will read and display odds 
automaticly. A couple of these read packets and a couple use image 
recon. However the packet reading types tend to only work with one or 
two diffrent programs, or be overpriced and the image recon. on the 
others does tend to be a little slow, poorly layed out, display little 
infromation and overpriced. There does seem to be a gap in the market 
for a poker odds calculator that will automaticly read the cards, 
display more than just the chances, work on many poker programs but not 
to bombard the user with odds (like in many high priced programs), 
displaying the information clearly (Die windows API!) and come in at a 
reasonable price, say 25 dollars.<br><br>Thus far, the program has 
advanced to a point where it hads a modular way to add and register new 
poker programs which should alow easyer updating. The recognition does 
work pritty well, however football365 poker is a right pain in the 
backside and will have to wait for an update. Also, the "main" odds have
 been implemented, along with the Hold card rankings. Still to be 
completed is the methods which determine how many hands are better than 
the users, which are proving more complex than expected.<br><br>However,
 all being well, I should have the core of the program working by the 
end of the week ready for the implementation of new poker programs and 
improved GUI on course for a release within 2 weeks after that.<br><br>Back to the grindstone...<br> <br><br> If everything in life had a point.
