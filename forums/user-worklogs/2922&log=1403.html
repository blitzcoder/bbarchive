 I think I've basically got enough shaders for Packs 1 and 2 now. I now 
need to tidy them up, check for any more optimizations I can make, 
package them up, finish up the website, setup a forum and I'm done. Or 
at least, I'm done to the point where I can begin, if that makes sense.<br><br>There
 will still be more to do, but that's the basics out of the way. I can 
then begin work on some more demos, some better screenshots for the 
site, tutorials, all that sort of thing.<br><br>Hopefully I can get to 
the first milestone by the end of the weekend, but that depends how much
 time I have available.

 I did manage to spend a couple of hours reading up on texture 
splatting, and I've written a shader which implements two layer texture 
splatting. I should now be able to go on and write shaders to do three 
and four layer splatting with ease. I'm not sure if I'll go beyond four 
layers. Perhaps for another pack, but I think for the basics pack, it's 
probably overkill.<br><br>Also banged out some simple shaders to do 
blending operations. Just simple stuff, but people will want them. So 
just your ordinary lightmap, shadowmap, add, subtract, Mod4X, Mod2X,

beautifully even if I do say so myself, but they're still cubes.<br><br>This

 Spent all of today working on the site design. When I've got these 
shaders complete, I'll need somewhere to put them. The site design looks
 good, but it needs more work. Specifically it needs some sample images 
from the shader pack, but I can do that soon. It doesn't need a ton of 
content, so it's a good start. It could definitely use a forum, but I'll
 have a go at setting up SMF tomorrow, and adding a theme to make it 
look similar to the site.<br><br>As for the the shaders, I'm slowing 
down in ideas now. I've added some for reflections, some for holograms, 
some for basic texture blending, landscape. I'll probably add some 
shaders for metal, glass and water before I'm done.<br><br>Beyond that, 
I'm not sure. Perhaps procedural texture shaders? I'm not sure how 
popular those would be. Procedural normal maps might be interesting. 
They'd be gimmicky though, not the most useful of shaders. I think a few
 more and I'll have enough for the first two packs, and that'll do for 
now.<br><br>Then I just have to put together some better demos. I'm 
already working on getting some better media. You can only go so far 
with a normal-mapped cube. Sure it's a damn fine looking cube with sexy 
normal-mapping, per-pixel lighting and specular highlights, but it's 
still a damn cube.<br><br>So yeah, finish the site, better demos, more 
screenshots, a few more shaders, a forum, tons of promotion.. Guess I 
won't be getting the weekend off. <br><br> <a href="http://starsentineltactics.com/" target="_blank">Star Sentinel Tactics</a><br><a href="http://www.imagineergames.com/" target="_blank">Shades of Violet</a><br><a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=82432" target="_blank">TV3D Module</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Something Special Now</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-12-01)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 I finally got up the nerve to try my hand at one of the "special" 
shaders I had in mind to do, and it was surprisingly easy. I'm not sure 
why I thought it would be hard, but you don't see people doing it much 
so I thought it might be deceptively difficult to get working, but nope.<br><br>As
 far as I can make out, this is generally referred to as detail normal 
mapping. At a distance, it looks pretty much like a standard normal 
mapping shader, right?<br><br><img src="2922&amp;log=1403_files/DetailNormalFar.jpg"><br><br>Except there appear to be a few bumpy spots that weren't there before, right? Well let's zoom in and take a closer look.<br><br><img src="2922&amp;log=1403_files/DetailNormalNear.jpg"><br><br>Yes,
 it's using TWO normal maps ( and two diffuse maps, for that matter. ) 
The second normal map is tiled X ( you choose ) number of times over the
 top of the standard normal map, allowing you to use a detail normal 
map, just as you would use a detail texture to add detail to environment
 and landscape textures.<br><br>Of course, it has options for specular 
and attenuation and 1-4 lights, just like the others. I'm pretty happy 
with these special additions.<br><br>By the way, all the funky rainbow 
colors are just to show the effects, they're not mandatory. It actually 
looks much sexier if you use more standard colors, but it's not as 
obvious how many light sources you've got or where they are. <br><br> <a href="http://starsentineltactics.com/" target="_blank">Star Sentinel Tactics</a><br><a href="http://www.imagineergames.com/" target="_blank">Shades of Violet</a><br><a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=82432" target="_blank">TV3D Module</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>WIP Screenshot</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-11-30)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Ok, I changed my mind. Here's a screeny of a very basic normal mapping 
shader. The parallax mapping and the top-secret experimental one both 
look better and bumpier than this, but I still think this one looks 
pretty bumpy. Three light sources plus specular highlights on this 
shader. Light attenutation too.<br><br><img src="2922&amp;log=1403_files/normal3spec.jpg"> <br><br> <a href="http://starsentineltactics.com/" target="_blank">Star Sentinel Tactics</a><br><a href="http://www.imagineergames.com/" target="_blank">Shades of Violet</a><br><a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=82432" target="_blank">TV3D Module</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Environment Bumpmapping</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-11-30)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 I've added another five shaders for environment bumpmapping today. They
 essentially reflect a cubemap on your mesh, but distort the reflection 
using a normal map to create a sort of smoked glass effect. You can use 
either a static or dynamic cube map, the choice is yours. There are four
 to allow blending options with a base texture, and also to blend 
between two layers using vertex alpha.<br><br>I've also written a couple
 of shaders for terrains, and a couple more general purpose blending 
shaders. I haven't yet decided how to structure the pack(s) but I'm 
thinking that theming them might be more useful for the customers. 
Perhaps a general purpose pack with blending shaders, some simple 
material shaders for metals and things, and probably some water shaders 
since those are always popular. And then perhaps have a bumpmapping pack
 ( including normal, parallax and something a bit special, as well as 
environment bump mapping ) after that, and then perhaps some more 
specialized ones after that.<br><br>I might try my hand at scene/post 
processing shaders as well, but those are more difficult to make generic
 as they can be hard to fit into an unfamiliar engine. Simple ones like 
sepia post processing or desaturation are easy, but anything involving 
multiple passes like motion blue, depth of field and bloom/HDR can be 
very difficult for beginngers to work with. You have multiple render 
surfaces and those rendersurfaces can require obscure formats, and it 
just gets really out of hand very easily.<br><br>I'll get around to 
posting some screenshots soon. I'm just wanting to get as much done as I
 can at the moment.

 Parallax mapping surprised me in two ways. Firstly, be being a 
significant improvement over normal mapping. It really does make you 
think you've got real geometry there, even when you wrote the shader 
yourself. Secondly, by being pretty easy to implement. I've got it 
working just like normal mapping, so all the same variations and 
customizations will be available.<br><br>Next? Dunno.. reflections 
maybe? Or terrain shaders? I'll see how I feel tomorrow. I have work 
commitments for the rest of today. <br><br> <a href="http://starsentineltactics.com/" target="_blank">Star Sentinel Tactics</a><br><a href="http://www.imagineergames.com/" target="_blank">Shades of Violet</a><br><a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=82432" target="_blank">TV3D Module</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Sixteen Normal Mapping Shaders</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-11-28)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Ok, I've completed sixteen normal mapping shaders. I decided not to add
 another sixteen shaders just to use a different set of UV coordinates. 
It's really very easy to do if you want to, and if there's interest in 
the pack but people want the UV coordinate option, I can maybe write 
another sixteen normal mapping shaders for a second pack of shaders.<br><br>Each
 of the normal mapping shaders has as many tweakables as possible. You 
can, firstly, set your diffuse color. This is really the base color of 
the mesh. Like if you were using EntityColor, and how that effects 
textures. If you're using one of the eight shaders which also gives you 
specular highlights ( which looks very cool and gives that shiny 
metallic look which has become almost synonymous with normal mapping ) 
then you can also set your specular color. So even if you have a red 
light and a blue light, you can have green-tinted specular highlights if
 you want. This enables some very cool effects.<br><br>Of course, your 
lights can be specific ( either through shader semantics or manually 
passing values ) and both their position and color can be set. Being 
able to set the color is vital with multiple light sources, as you only 
really get the really sexy looking effects if you have different colored
 light sources. But they can be the same if you're boring. Your choice.<br><br>You
 can, of course, also set the light decay rate for the eight shaders 
which have light attenuation. This affects how fast ( or slow ) the 
light decays. This is nice for indoor environments where you want your 
lights to behave as point lights. For outdoor environments, you will 
probably want to use the shaders without light attenuation, where the 
lights effectively behave as infinite range light sources.<br><br>And, 
of course, you can set your diffuse ( base color ) and normal map 
textures. The old favourite cobblestone is the one I've been testing 
with and it really does have a deep bumpy effect, even if I do say so 
myself.<br><br>I guess I'll have a look at parallax mapping now. I 
always thought parallax mapping was a lot better than normal mapping, 
but now that I have the normal mapping working, it looks almost as good 
as the best parallax mapping I've seen.  Perhaps I'll surprise myself 
with the parallax mapping too? <br><br> <a href="http://starsentineltactics.com/" target="_blank">Star Sentinel Tactics</a><br><a href="http://www.imagineergames.com/" target="_blank">Shades of Violet</a><br><a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=82432" target="_blank">TV3D Module</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Normal Mapping Shaders</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2006-11-28)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 It's already apparent that there are lots of different variations on 
even a basic shader, and it's hard to predict exactly what people will 
want.<br><br>For normal mapping, a popular one and no mistake, I'm going
 with one to four lights, basic normal mapping, so thats four shaders. 
Then another four which include light attenuation ( point lights as 
opposed to infinite lights ) and then another eight to repeat all that 
with specular highlights for each lightsource. So that's 16 shaders just
 for normal mapping. Ouch!<br><br>Then perhaps people might want to use 
different UV channels for the diffuse and normal map. If I include that 
for all variations, we're up to 32 shaders. Double ouch!<br><br>I 
suppose I don't *have* to cover all these variations, but if you're the 
type of guy who wants to buy a pack of shaders instead of coding your 
own, you don't want to have to mess with the code much, do you?<br><br>Hopefully some of the other shaders won't require so many variations. <br><br> <a href="http://starsentineltactics.com/" target="_blank">Star Sentinel Tactics</a><br><a href="http://www.imagineergames.com/" target="_blank">Shades of Violet</a><br><a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=82432" target="_blank">TV3D Module</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
