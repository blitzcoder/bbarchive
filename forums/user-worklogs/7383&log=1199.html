 decided to start this project so I can easily add any particle effect 
to any game I create in the future. Although many features<br>are not 
needed for my current game project, I decided to add every possible 
feature I can think off, so I'd not need to dig into the old<br>code later just to add something that some new project may need. <br><br>Anyway,
 I'm sure that Blitz community needs this kind of project too ! There 
are lot of particle libraries for Blitz, but this one<br>will be something special... I hope :)<br><br>Current functional features ( v 0.98b )<br><br>1.-
 Very fast.. I don't think it can be any faster than this. Why ? First 
of all, it's single surface. Second, it uses best combination of 
ClearSurface/AddVertex and Vertexcoords methods ( they both have their 
strengths and weak points ). Third - it's UpdateParticles function<br>is
 optimized to maximum, and most important, it uses several powerful 
methods of "particle culling" - i.e. particles that are part of the 
surface but not visible will not be rendered. There are several other 
reasons why I say "Very,very fast", but you should wait for the first 
demo effects so you can see it in action :)<br><br>2. Objects as emitters - In many particle systems only points can act as emitters. In CPS emitters can be :<br> - point, line, box, area, ellipse, sphere, cone, cylinder... and they can be rotated along any axis !<br> - You can also define one part of these objects ! Let's say half sphere, quarter of ellipse and so on...<br> Particles paths can be defined in standard custom way or IN or OUT from these virtual object emitters<br> This was one of the main features that I wanted from some good particle system.<br><br>3.
  Additionally to objects as source for particles, you can define exact 
number of points on objects that will act as "emit points".<br>By 
default, particles are created randomly on the surface of the object, 
but for example , if you choose line as emitter object, you can set 
Points on 5 and particles will be created only from those 5 points 
evenly positioned across the line.<br><br><br>4. 2D and 3D viewports - one more very important feature<br>
 You can define rectangle, ellipse or any convex or concave polygon on 
screen that will act as area where particles will only be visible ( or 
not visible )<br> You can define any number of these viewports and they can act only on specific emitters.<br>
 3D viewports can be box and sphere and will act separately or in 
combination from 2D ones. They are defined in "real world" coordinates, 
unlike 2D ones which are defined with screen coordinates<br><br>5. 
Particle "culling" - although emitters are single surface, particles 
that are out of screen or out of defined viewports will not be rendered 
next frame...<br>Let's say you have 1000 particles currently active, but
 only 600 of them are currently visible - including this option your FPS
 rate will increase significantly !<br>CPS can achieve this through 
various methods - CameraProject , Custom Camera Project ( much faster 
then built-in blitz CameraProject ), using LinePick when particles are 
behind some object in the world, and trough 2D or 3D viewports <br>And 
particles that are not visible will still be "alive", they will just be 
removed from the surface until they became visible again.<br><br>6. Forces - without forces, particle system is very limited in it's real game usage, so I added them too:<br> - Simple forces - they act simply with adding specific number to velocity every frame<br>
 - Global Forces - they are defined globally ( like wind, gravity ) and 
they take into account acceleration and mass of particles<br> - Other 
Forces - they are defined as cones with Min/Max force, Min/Max range, 
direction and position. They also take into account mass and 
acceleration of particles.<br> Like viewports, forces can act also on specific emitters, they can be changed over time etc..<br><br>7.
 Collisions - I'm working on this right now - currently you can define 
collision objects as triangle, ellipse, rectangle and sphere but I'll 
add more of them, I think :)<br> Particles can bounce, stop, slide or die when collide with collision objects<br> more on collisions when it's finished :)<br><br>8.
 "OverLife" parameters for all particles properties ! It means that you 
can define up to 10 points in particle's life so particles will reach 
given value at that point and will go toward next value in next defined 
point in life. For example, you can define that particles start with red
 color, then on 10% of life they became green, on 35% they became 
purple, on 50% they became yellow, on 60% they became red again and so 
on.<br> Another example - you can set particle's alphaoverlife property,
 so particle starts visible/ then on 30% of life became nonvisible/ on 
50% 1/4 visible etc...<br> You can set overlife values for color, transparency, velocity, spin, rotation, size etc...<br> You can additionally set "repeater" value - so you can repeat defined cycle n times over particles life !<br><br>9.
 OverLife values can be set for emitters too. For example - new 
particles that are created will start red, then when emitter reach 10% 
of it's lifetime, new particles will start green and so on... this may 
be little confusing as you read, but once you see it in action, 
everything will be easy :)<br><br>10. You can start emitting particles 
all at once, at specific rate or you can let particle system to choose 
best rate to achieve lastemitted/firstdied state !<br><br>11. It's dead 
easy to use - simple emitters can be start only with 3-4 commands, and 
very complex particle systems can be achieved with 8-10 commands. The 
only command in your main loop will be UpdateAllParticles(). Or if you 
want to update only specific emitter - UpdateParticles(EmitterID). This 
way "non-important" emitters ( or emitters that are far from camera ) 
can be updated every n-th frame.<br><br>12. You can Freeze and Unfreeze 
specific emitters - Example: let's say you defined a fountain. But 
fountain needs 2 seconds to "build itself". Now, when it's not visible, 
you can freeze the fountain ( and save all FPS that it gets ) and 
unfreeze it when it becomes visible again. Unlike FreezeEmitter, 
StopEmitter will stop emitting new particles for fountain ( or 
optionally kill all of it's live particles )<br><br>Other features are more "standard" ones :<br>- particles can face camera ( you can have different camera for different emitter )<br>- circular movement for particles<br>- particles can use specific frame of texture ( using texture U/V coordinates ) <br>- particles can emit particles from other emitters during their life, or start specific emitters when they die...<br>- Particles can be rendered FirstFirst or LastFirst<br>- Particles can be "aligned to motion "<br>- Set blend mode, alpha mode, Fulbright mode<br>- Start, stop, position, rotate emitters<br>- Copy defined emitters into new ones<br>- Parameters for particles : RGB ( color ), alpha, velocity, gravity, spin, rotation, number... and their variation values<br><br>To do:<br> - little more optimizing<br> - more collision options<br> - more 3D viewport objects<br> - more demo effects<br> - manual<br>...<br><br>Today, CPS library is 104kb in size and over 3300 lines of code... <br>Planned release date - end of April 2004<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
