 Ok, it's been a while since i posted on this, but i'm moving forward 
alot. I have added in loading, using the windows file requestor. Thanks 
to some code i found in the archives. Also added in scaling mode, which 
is fairly important.<br><br>Other additions include:<br><br>Parent/child
 tracking - A visual link between the child and parent will be in the 
form of a line between the meshes, which updates and follows when the 
meshes are moved. I also implemented 3d bounding boxes, coloured so you 
can identify what mesh is a parent and what is a child. If you select an
 entity, it will have a bounding box BLUE. It's parent will have a RED 
bounding box and it's child have have a GREEN bounding box.<br><br>Back 
to the loading system. When a mesh is loaded in, it is put into an array
 of master meshes. And a copy is created and placed on the map. So, 
everytime you want another mesh of that kind, you simply copy it, or use
 the multi-place mode, where you click on the geometry and it will drop a
 copy and align it to an axis you choose. It doesn't need to be aligned 
however. This will be useful for alot of things such as placing an 
entity side by side with another one :o) or say putting chairs against 
walls. An option to invert the normals would be good too.<br><br>All 
this is done for rendering speeds and as little memory usage as 
possible. The only problem will be saving this. I will need to save this
 out as a .b3d and run the final scene through Gile[s] to lightmap it. 
THEN, export it to .b3d and import it into the editor, break up 
everything upon loading and save out to a level file, so i can sort out 
master meshes and what entities are copies... etc<br><br>I have made 
everything centre on it's local axis upon loading into the editor. It 
makes it simplier to rotate items, as the mesh centre can't be changed 
for copied entities, as it effects all the copies. They are also scaled 
to a size of 1 unit wide or deep, depending on which is largest.<br><br>There
 is a few problems with rotate mode. For some reason, when you click but
 don't drag on a child entity, it spins for no reason. Something to do 
with the parenting process no doubt. Anyway, screenies later :o) <br><br> -----------------------------------------<br>Athlon64 3200+, 1 GB RAM, Radeon 9800 Pro 128 MB .WIN XP.

 I actually posted this a while back, on the blitz showcase i think. 
But, this is a progress update on the editor. I've added in Rotation 
mode. Each mode will make use of the Lock grid feature. You can lock any
 or all axis to a grid, for movement/rotation, and scaling when i get 
round to it. Same goes for locking movement/rotation along one axis.<br><br>Useful for moving say a cube along the X axis. It works pretty well together.<br><br>The
 buttons system works very well too. All of the button are single 
surface quads. BUT they use 2d screen positioning, just like an image. 
So, to detect whether the mouse is clicking on a button, i simple do a 
RectsOverlap check, using the buttons X,Y location and it's 
width/height. I'm proud of myself for that one :D<br><br>To try it out, with the full source code, sparing commented ;o), go here:<br><br>www.rosscrooks.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/editor_new.zip<br><br><img src="2603&amp;log=1324_files/editor_sc1.PNG"><br><br><img src="2603&amp;log=1324_files/editor_sc2.PNG"><br><br><img src="2603&amp;log=1324_files/editor_sc3.PNG"> <br><br> -----------------------------------------<br>Athlon64 3200+, 1 GB RAM, Radeon 9800 Pro 128 MB .WIN XP.
