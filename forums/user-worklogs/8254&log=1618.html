 well, things are now shaping up very nicely, and i have finnaly added 
the brush "engine" part to the physics engine, and thay seem to work 
nicely together :)<br>just Awsome!<br><br>the framerate is quite 
immpressive to, i think the way i created the brush engine makes it very
 smoth even when the whole screen is filled with objekts, when i play 
wound with the original crayon game, it seems to slowdown even with a 
very few objects on the screen... <br><br>of course, that game is a 
sloppy prototyp done in a few days, and he might have been able to fix 
these issues if he had given it more time, however.<br>my way of handeling brushes seems like a very good solution.<br><br>in general, things acts as expected.<br>A few tweaks and bug fixes is still neaded before i can do any form of public releas or demo...<br>but it is proberbly not to far away now :)<br><br>a
 have also asked a friend of mine (ho seems to like my project very 
much) to do a new paper texture for the background, so i dont have to 
rip kloonygames more than i need, he is a bit of an expert when it comes
 to camera work and taking pictures, so im sure it will turn out great 
:)<br><br>i still have to implement some of the game ellements, like the
 classical red ball, and a goal star... but since this seems like a 
rather simple task in compareson to the rest, and relativly little code 
for implementing, im not expecting any problems on those areas.<br><br>and of course, here is evrything in action :)<br><img src="8254&amp;log=1618_files/crayonPhysics3.jpg"> <br><br> /Xip<br><br>Workstation - AMD 2100+, 1024DDR, AGP(4x) AX1650 256mb, XP pro </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>The brush engine</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2008-07-01)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext"> Alrighty, first worklog, latest project, and a very cool one it is :)<br><br>I
 have been working on my crayon physics clone for some time now, and i 
just got my brush-drawing engine working, and i must say the crayon 
feeling and realism is not to bad, im very happy with the result :)<br><br><img src="8254&amp;log=1618_files/brushTest.jpg"><br>(showing only the crayon-brush rendering in action)<br><br><br>Now,
 the physics parts are working as well (without graphics, only rendering
 naked vertexes), but as soon as i mix these to together, things will 
look just awsome :)<br><br><br><img src="8254&amp;log=1618_files/gameEngine0.png"><br>(The game engine running without any brushes, vertexes only)<br><br><br>The
 game engine also optemizes the shapes drawn by the user to minimize the
 number of vertexes the physics engine(Chipmunk) needs to work with, but
 these algoritms stil has some work and tweaking ahead of them.<br><br>and if any one wants to play around with the Brush-demo test, it can be found here:<br><br><a href="http://xip.software.googlepages.com/CrayonBrushDemo.rar" target="_blank">http://xip.software.googlepages.com/CrayonBrushDemo.rar</a><br><br>it
 should be noted that the background image, are from the original crayon
 physics game by Kloonygames, i might change this later... but on the 
other hand, it IS a clone after all... <br>the same goes for the brush'sprites, however... thay are slightly modifyd.<br><br>more news will be here as soon as things comes to gether :)<br>stay tuned<br><br>any feedback on this project can be directed to this thread:<br><a href="http://blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=78970" target="_blank">http://blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=78970</a> <br><br> /Xip<br><br>Workstation - AMD 2100+, 1024DDR, AGP(4x) AX1650 256mb, XP pro </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
