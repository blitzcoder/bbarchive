 our family project.<br><br>We are using a combination of programmes and tools as follows:<br><br>3DS
 Max (5.1), Gile[s], Tree[D], Milkshape, Ultimate Unwrap, Photoshop,  
Blitz 3d (duh!), Swifts Shadows and particles, Filax's wonderful BCF 
3.0, hopefully Tokamak, and last but not least a pencil and paper.<br><br>We only started this week to design and make models and maps.

 I spent about an hour on the phone to Mousey last night and we went 
throught Dragonsphere together, he suggested a few minor changes all 
have now been implemented.<br><br>This afternoon I put a new additional 
bit into the ice cave to stop you going directly for what's at the back -
 I'm a ****** aren't I?<br><br>I also had a mess with a few other items just to tidy it all up.  <br><br>The Finished demo will be available tonight - Thursday 6th December, 2001.<br><br>I will post in the forum when it's ready.<br><br>Until then...<br><br>IPete2.<br><br>****************** Work Log Update *************<br><br>Well the whole thing is 12 MB - zipped. <br><br>It
 is now Friday - I have spent about three hours (until 2.am) with my 
stupid dial up connection trying to get it out to you guys...  At one 
stage I got to 10.15MB and the line closed (this was after 1 hr 45 mins 
or so).<br><br>So I have elected to ask a friend of mine if I could borrow his ADSL line and try again.<br><br>'Dragonsphere' should be available today sometime.

let you know although I have been working hard for the last few days on 
work projects I have put some time into "Dragonsphere" too!<br><br>I 
have now put in an Ice Cave which I wanted to add because of the fab 
lighting colours and fx you can play with in Blitz / DirectX.  I have 
restrained myself here too as it is easy to get carried away!<br><br>I 
also tried to put in a mirror plane without much success, in the end I 
put something resembling the effect (well almost).  At least it doesn't 
have the same hit as a mirror plane and it is only in one, appropriate

 spent a good deal of time making progress with the endgame side of the 
demo. (In fact the demo only really ends when you get bored, which I 
hope won't be until you've seen everything!)  I have put a lot of stuff 
in the demo to keep people interested with a variety of different types 
of stuff.<br><br>I put in the actual "Dragonsphere" of the title -today too,  which uses another feature of Blitz (sprite and rotation).<br><br>I also included a neat kind of 'gift' for staying with the demo until the very end and facing the main in game enemy.<br><br>I have decided not to employ a devise to kill you or the enemy as it's more fun 'playing' them against each other.  <br><br>You will be able to go wherever you want as long as you have the requisite objects - I'll leave that for you to discover.<br><br>The
 adventure demo game is really a series of discoveries and useages, you 
can find stuff and use it somewhere - not everything you understand, 
just some of it.<br><br>Confused? Well it will all become clear when it is released - when?  VERY VERY SOON! (This week unless something dire happens!).<br><br>Size
 wise it is hovering at about 18MB before compression into a zip file.  I
 will be zipping it instead of RARing due to the accessability of Zip in
 people's possession.<br><br>Time to go and do a little more before sleep time!<br><br>If you are reading my logs I hope you are getting intrigued...

 a couple of days where not much has happened last night was a real 
bummer!  I found a problem which I am pretty sure is a Blitz 
'restriction' - although I'm not sure yet I await to hear from Mark.<br><br>I
 tried to attach a pivot to an animated mesh - oh no - 'illegal memory 
address' kept coming up - it was a real git to find the cause too!  <br><br>Any
 way, I have now separated the wings from the body (of Sulphurbreath in 
case you're wondering) and it works fine this way - but it's a work 
around at the moment.<br><br>Any way, as I said, Sulphurbreath now has 
wings and from the above you can guess that they move (cause I mentioned
 the animation problem - with me?!) and he now moves too! (shh! it'll be
 our secret).<br><br>That's about the sum of my days work today.  I put a
 sound fx on them but you can't hear because of all the other racket

 - Er You know how I said just finish no more developing? erm, how can I
 put this er sorry but I have just added an excellent new bit which 
gives the adventure new depths - literally!  Now you have to go and get 
something from deep in the mountain caves too!  But be very careful you 
don't faaaaaalllllll! :)<br><br>He he - now down to the other bits done 
today.  I spent a long time messing trying to get a character with 
facial features clothes etc.  I've given up tonight cause I'm not very 
good at it! :( so I'm going to have a bit of a rethink and come up with 
an alternative approach to this bit of the game.  Sadly the Witch may 
not survive my rethink!<br><br>I must look at pulling it all together 
tomorrow (Wednesday) adding titles etc.  Then I'll have to pack it and 
really compress it somehow.<br><br>IPete2.<br><br>--------------------<br><br><br><br><br>Worklog 04 - "Dragonsphere"<br><br>Monday
 - hmm didn't do very much today due to being very tired from last 
nights 2.00am session. But by the end of the evening I had fixed a 
problem and come up with a solution to the bit which was bugging me 
about getting the shield in the game.<br><br>Now you can get the shield and escape walking in the gaseous gloop (oops giving too much away here so I'll stop there).<br><br>Still got away to go before releasing - but progress, although slow, is overall being made.<br><br>No more new ideas - just fix up the old ones and deliver!  That's the philospohy I have to keep reminding myself about.<br><br>IPete2.<br>-----------------------------<br><br>Worklog 03 - "Dragonsphere"<br><br>Sunday - has come and gone and I have only had an hour on my project today... so far... <br><br>...(edited from later that night!)<br><br>If I release it now it would be a shame so I have decided to wait until it's done - just like Mr M.<br><br>I have actually added quite a lot this evening and a whole new micro-quest has found it's way in - it is a nice idea too!<br><br>The
 problem is that the idea to start with was to explore what you could 
achieve with B3D and so far that has proved that almost eveything you 
would want to do is possible.  <br><br>So my demo adventure is really 
never going to end it is organic.  But I want to release a version which
 is worth exploring and is worth the download (because it will be big!)<br><br>This evening then...<br><br>...I have just added a large cavernous area with some excellent hidden and dangerous areas and things to be careful of.<br><br>Included
 in this are an interior 'gaseous' section and the shield to protect 
you.  But you can't get to it without a little 'ride' first! (he he 
he:))<br><br>I hope you guys 'n gals will download it and play it to let me know what you think - when it is ready!  <br><br>Back to it for a few minutes longer now.<br><br>-----------<br>Worklog 02 - "Dragonsphere" <br><br>Okay
 today - Saturday 17th November - I have only had about two hours and 
Sulphurbreath had to change shape so that is done.  He also attacks now -
 excellent!<br><br>You can also defend against him now too - also very excellent!  Collision yet to be achieved for scoring though.<br><br>Endgame therefore half worked out now.<br><br>Still needs a lot of work to meet my release schedule for tomorrow - Sunday - evening! <br><br>And I have to go Christmas shopping tomorrow! :) (and order Jak and Daxter!  :))<br><br>-----------<br><br>Worklog 01 - "Dragonsphere" a mini adventure game with as many Blitz 3D features as I could squeeze in.<br><br>Day to night transitions.<br>Rising, rotating full-moon with detailed texture.<br>Particle fx include snow, smoke, fire, magic.<br>Animated toadstool which slowly chases you.<br>Objects to collect and use.<br>Interesting, multi-level, medium sized playscape.<br>Hidden objects to find.<br>3D Sound effects and some plain old 2d sound effects too.<br>Textured landscape transitions into snowy landscape.<br>Lighting effects / flickering torches etc.<br>Indoors and outdoors (enter the stone hut and caves).<br>Animated river texture (very basic).<br>Psionic's animated MD2 Alien (thanks Psionic).<br>Psionic's weapon store (thanks again Psionic).<br>Lots of other bits and pieces just for interest sake including a sprite tree orchard, <br><br>Hopefully you people will enjoy just wandering around having a look at everything.<br><br>*******************  The Log  **************<br><br>The majority of this mini adventure/roam about game is complete.  <br><br>I have built the title sequence separately and they need to be included soon.<br><br>I
 have just begun work on the end scenario today. Sulphurbreath is now in
 and half u and r.  The end battle has still to be actioned.  I need to 
put a ceiling on his cave and some more particle fx and other features 
inside his cave.  A bit more audio is needed too!<br><br>Tomorrow 
(Saturday - launch day -1) I will attempt to round up the last of the 
mini quests and start to tie it all together.  The Witch needs 
attention, as does the Icy Cove Store, the sword still needs attention 
as does the magic spell bit.<br><br>Other than that I'm as there as I'll ever be with this one.  <br><br>Keep an eye out for this one on Sunday night! (GMT) :)<br><br>BTW
 - it will be quite big as there is a lot in it.  I will compress it as 
best I can but the sound alone is going to be a couple of MBs!<br><br>IPete2.<br> <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
