 - Since we'll have to make a game during the semester I can't work on 
Worlds during this time (Worlds could never be finished in 4 months!).<br>The
 game I'll be working on now will hopefully feature some kind of 
landscape engine (I'm considering the ROAM algorithm but it might be too
 cpu intensive...). Also I will do some very basic optimizations like 
software culling... I'd also like my engine to be able to import 3D 
objects, somehow exported from Blender. But the landscape comes first - 
if that takes too long the player and enemies will simply be boxes. I 
think it will be a basic action game... Definitely not fps.<br> <br><br> -Ibmurai </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>The beginning... again.</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2005-08-20)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 I've just purchased BlitzMax with the specific intent of finally making
 Worlds. Worlds is a very old idea of mine, now. I've tried programming 
it twice before, and one time I came really close to finishing it, but 
there were a lot of things - central things - that I weren't happy with 
so the project died. This time it won't die; Though it might take quite 
some years before it's done.<br><br>My approach this time is to just 
start programming, gradually creating a universe... As I see it, the 
game won't actually be playable until late in the development, since the
 universe should be able to live and play itself.<br><br>The first thing
 to do is create planets - The way planets are represented in this game 
is what makes it unique, so I'm not gonna share that just yet. But I 
guess I can't help but post a shot or two when I feel they're done. I 
just really hope that noone will copy my idea (and if someone does copy 
my idea I hope their project fails - this is my brainchild)<br><br>Next entry will be when I'm done with the basic planets.<br> <br><br> -Ibmurai </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
