 I purchased Particle Candy about a week ago and now I've god some nice 
smoke and fire effects.  It's also working well for flak bursts.  I've 
tweaked the lens flare a bit but still need to make proper flare 
textures.  I've only got about 4-5 things left before I can do a 
multiplayer alpha test.<br><br>-choose a network module<br>-get the landing gear physics worked out<br>-bullet and damage code<br>-make a decent desert area for combat <br><br> [Core2D][Sprite][MaxVerlet] </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Progress</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-07-21)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Last night I got a couple of things done.  I snagged Rob's Fast Hud 
routine from the archives.  It works great and is pixel perfect (as far 
as I can tell).  I also utilized his lens flare code from the archives 
too.  It works a treat when combined with his hud routines.<br><br>Getting
 the hud working inspired me to create an altitude gauge.  I thought 
inkscape would be limiting but I'm finding it's on par with PSP9 and 
actually allows me to create things incredibly faster.  You might think 
vector art isn't a good match for a flight sim but there's a Blur 
attribute for each vector piece so you can smooth out the straight 
edges.  Give Inkscape a try, you might be surprised.<br><br>What I 
really need to do is get a world creation pipeline finalized.  Right now
 I'm taking real geographic elevation data and converting it into 
terrain (thanks to all Krischan's hard work on BlitzTiles).  Which will 
work really well if I wanted to map out a real battle that took place in
 for instance, Metz, Belgium.  That would also allow me to recreate 
actual combat missions straight out of history (which would also be a 
good selling point).<br><br>As for the effects, I'm looking into all 
kinds of solutions. I've been watching old WWII air combat videos on 
youtube and studing how the bullets tracers look.  I really want to 
capture realistic gun firing visuals.  And explosions.  I've also been 
thinking about actually deforming the terrain when a bomb is dropped.  
That way you can crater out the enemies airfield and it will stay like 
that.  That'd make defending the base even more important (AA guns).  
Speaking of AA guns, like how the shell explodes and the smoke expands. 
 Things like that that will really put a sense of danger in the game.<br><br>As
 for the terrain, the game will be played on one 10K x 10K meter 
terrain.  I'm leaving the terrain_quality setting on 32 for right now 
(which is very low poly).  I still haven't incorporated the scenegraph 
stuff but will hopfully get to it next week or so.<br><br>So much to do.
  For now I'm just working on the hud and lens flare.  The lens flare 
will meld NICELY with Krischan's sky in BlitzTiles.<br><br>Until next time.<br><br>Chroma <br><br> [Core2D][Sprite][MaxVerlet] </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>GNet for BMax</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-07-16)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Well I finished the Server side of GNet for BMax.  When you start the 
dedicated server, it adds your server to the blitzbasic.com BlitzNet 
page.<br><br>Now to just write the client portion where you perform a 
server query and retrieve the list of servers.  Gonna have to do that 
tomorrow as I'm beat.<br><br>Oh, I put the GNet thing in the code archives.<br><br>Next
 on the list.  Incorporate the scenegraph stuff into blitztiles and also
 use it to limit collision checking.  I only need to check collision on 
the segment of ground that the jet is directly over.  And since the 
terrain is split into segments and each of those meshes is stored in a 2
 dimensional array...I just get my x,z position and store it...and then 
do a one time check to either enable collision.  THen if the segment i'm
 on changes then I do another switcheroo with collision. <br><br> [Core2D][Sprite][MaxVerlet] </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Server Experiments with MaxGUI</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2009-07-14)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 I'm using MaxGUI as the vessel to make this happen.  If you do a simple
 loop and use PollEvent(), the framerate is outrageous.  To the point to
 where trying to use delta time is nuts cuz the frames are so fast.<br><br>This
 is gonna work well and provide a nice sleek interface and also 
lightning speed.  The speed was never really a problem though because 
each client will spawn their own thread upon connection.  Hopefully I'll
 have something in the next couple of days.  I'm dying to get a 
multiplayer version of the flight engine up and running.<br><br>I've 
also reworked Mark's GNET sample code to work with bmax.  So the flight 
engine server will be available from the blitzbasic site. <br><br> [Core2D][Sprite][MaxVerlet] </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
