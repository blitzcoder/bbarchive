 I decided to take the Torque road for game design. The development 
tools are simply more efficient. BlitzMax however is a wonderful tool 
for creating cross-platform apps and I really hope the 3D stuff will get
 even better for further 3D development. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Dev Update</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2007-02-23)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 Work on SWARM is going well. I'm currently drawing the shapes for the 
enemies with Inkscape and thinking about how I want the levels to be. At
 first I wanted to have vertical scrolling levels but now I'm thinking 
about maybe doing 4-axis levels like you can roam around in any 
direction. I think this would suit the feeling of the game as I want it.<br>Oh: and I'm listening to the Rocky Balboa soundtrack while working on SWARM =) One of the best OSTs in the past 2 years imho. <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>It'll be called SWARM</td><td align="right"><font class="tiny">(Posted 2007-02-12)</font></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="posttext">
 1. I now got my iMac. It's a beautiful 17" all in one computer system 
with the most modern operating system on the harddrive that is available
 today: Mac OS X. I won't rant about how archaic Windows is (even Vista)
 compared to OS X. Just wanted to let you know that I'm on Macintosh now
 (important since it's my development machine).<br><br>2. My website ( <a href="http://www.moonshape.net/" target="_blank">http://www.moonshape.net</a>
 ) is ready and 100% created on my Mac using iWeb. It was very easy but I
 must say it would be better if iWeb would create PHP based websites 
rather than simple html. But nevertheless it's pretty easy to use, I 
like it :-)<br><br>3. My game will be called SWARM and it will be a 2D 
shoot em up merged with a snake like gameplay where you must build up a 
swarm of wingmen. Did you never wonder how a single spaceship is able to
 defeat all those bad guys in the normal 2D shoot em ups? SWARM will 
give you the opportunity to send a whole army to kick the bad boys asses

 Ok, still no name, still no game. But I now know at least that I want 
to do something modable. I've got a BVM license and koriolis lets me 
play with the BVM 2 beta ^^<br>I'm also still trying to sell my notebook so I can get myself an 17" iMac. But nobody wants it :-(<br>Is 900 Euro really too much for an Intel CoureDuo 1.8GHz, 1 GB RAM, Radeon x1600 plus accessories and software?<br>Questions over questions... <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="posthead"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Nuclear ressearch?

 I'm recently searching for a new game idea (or mix some different game 
ideas up etc.). My first attempt was something like Sudoku but with a 
gamedesign that would allow multiplayer (like in Tetris where you can 
send rows over to the AI or a second player) but I'm not that happy with
 my current approach.<br>Another funny stuff would be some kind of Chess
 with new and different characters like a Mage who could attack from the
 distance without actually moving. But that would require some good 3D 
modells and I'm a very bad 3D artist when it comes to character 
modelling ^^<br>I'll do more ressearch, I really hope to come up with 
something interesting. Maybe something the players could even create 
something... <br><br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
