Note that I haven't begun coding this particular program at all, but I <i>have</i> just discovered how to use ATan2, Sin, and Cos to aim a shot at something (which I credit to Saxon Physics and the lesson on vectors). Unfortunately, I don't understand some of the <i>other</i> things I think will be important to make the game work...<br><br><strike><b>Question #1: How and where do you use First, Last, Before, and After?</b> I tried to use First before in <i>something</i> -- I don't remember what, but I think it was something like this -- and it didn't work the way I thought it would. (These, I thought, would be useful in targeting, as towers often fire at the farthest-along enemy they can reach.)</strike> Key phrase "I <i>thought</i>." I probably won't use these, but the question brought up some new ones...<br><br><strike><b>Question #2: For a human or animal sprite seen directly from above</b> (as most of the "towers" I'm thinking of that require rotation will be) <b>fitting into a 32 x 32 pixel box, how many rotations should make any possible angle look reasonable without making the whole lag drastically?</b> I'm using CreateTimer() and WaitTimer() now, so the speed of the program depends less on the speed of the computer, but when I rotated something in real-time, it still slowed down a lot, and I suspect that having a different frame for every degree of rotation won't make the computer happy. Maneesh uses 16 as a middle ground between detail and speed, but that almost seems like just a few too few.</strike> Answered.<br><br><b>Question #3: In an interface that allows the user to click on an object to activate it</b> (show its range and give it upgrades and all that)<b>, how do you go about making sure that one and only one is active?</b><br><br>I think that's all for now... but I expect I'll find more later, once I actually get around to getting all of the sprites done and then actually starting to code the thing.

Simply do a distance check through each of your enemies and pick the one with the highest value.<br><br>Question 2:<br><br>As many rotations as you want - just don't use the rotateimage command and expect it to perform well at real time.  Pre render or prerotate your images as many times as you want, and then simply draw them.  The PC doesn't care what your image looks like in blitzplus - it is just a collection of pixels after all - so will draw it just as fast if the little man is facing left as if he is facing right ---&gt; as long as you have already stored the images in memory.

I haven't really used arrays much, although I have used them to get exact rotations. As for the Int((player\angle * 16) / 360) thing, though... As ATan2# can output negative angles, it seems like it could call for a negative frame/array-position. Would I have to add 180 to the resulting angle to get all positives, or should I plug in Abs(player\angle) for the equation and then have an extra If statement to help it decide which frame to use or something?<br><br>In other news, I've started coding!
