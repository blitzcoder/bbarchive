A loop only automatically increments its controlling variable; anything you put anywhere else will stay where it is.

My next question is, say I wanted to spawn a new instance of that type somewhere outside the main program, like for example if you press space it'll spawn an enemy or something.  Then I wanted to check image collision with another type, the player.  What's the best way to do that?  I tried declaring the type as global and then creating a new instance in my while wend loop.

Perhaps you could post some of your particular code?<br><br>I don't know if this is on the right track, but remember that the type of a variable or value only affects what you can do with the <i>whole</i> variable or value; it doesn't place restrictions on what you use its component fields (if any) for - their own type does. So a player, that is an instace of PlayerType, and a bot, that is an instance of EnemyType, can't both be indiscriminately passed to the same comparison function (checking player/player, bot/bot, or player/bot without specifying) - but they <i>can</i> both contain e.g. an image field, and you can check collisions on the image without worrying about what the type of its owner is.<br><br>e.g.<br><pre class=code>Local p.Player = ..., e.Enemy = ...

If ImagesCollide(p\img, p\x, p\y, 0, e\image, e\xpos, e\ypos, 0) Then ...</pre><br><br>Using different field names just to visually reinforce that the <i>result of the expression</i> carries no information about how it was obtained: an image is an image regardless of whether it was extracted from a field named img in an object of one type or a field named image in an object of another type.<br><br>You could also factor out the common elements into a component type (e.g. "Movable"), that both bots and players might "own" instances of - that way you can just compare two Movables without needing to think about what they actually control. (This is a bit more complicated to implement.) Useful if you want to also have bots colliding with other bots, players hunting both players and bots, etc. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

</pre><br><br>NOW<br><br>That is an extremely and simplified (and pointless) version of what I have so far (if i pasted what I really have it'd be a jumbled mess lol)<br><br>SO for my example, what would be the best way to go about checking if the player\image collides with the enemy\image?<br><br>I understand that the image handle kinda doesn't even matter, for some reason lol.  It's just the x and y for each that I need to check against each other, which raises problems because they are in separate objects and in separate for loops.  <br><br>How I'd normally go about this is to simply declare a variable and name it like enemyx, and then one for enemyy, then for each iteration of the for next loop I'd make the enemy\x = enemyx, so that I can just check against that variable, not against the field of the enemy.<br><br>Thanks a lot for helping though guys <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

next</pre><br><br>So it loops over each player, and on each iteration checks <i>every</i> enemy against it.<br><br>This method doesn't scale well (imagine: if you had a thousand of each, that's only two thousand things to draw on screen - not so bad - but a <i>million</i> collision checks), but it should be fine for say fewer than ten players and a couple of hundred enemies. For very large numbers of things you'd use a more complex approach, but no sense in getting complicated until you need it.<br><br><br>Note also that you don't need to combine drawing and collision checking in the same section of code (in fact, it's a good idea to keep them separate).
