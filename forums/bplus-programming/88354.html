So far, it’s doing everything that I’ve wanted it to do. But, my thought is  it seems like I’m doing many things the long way; for example,  if one looks at my code below, I made the borders  in my game out of actual images that I made with PAINT, and uploaded them. It seems like making those borders take forever; it took a day to make those.  Does it usually take that long? I’m making and organizing the code in such a way that makes sense to me (simply because I’m a beginner). It seems like the code that I put together doesn’t look like everybody else code, but looks like maybe a longer route to go. Thus, I was wondering what are some thoughts on this? Things still seem to be going pretty good even though I’ve been doing it my way. <br><br><br><pre class=code>

However, you know that these places will always be the same in comparison to the others; every time you move Henry you increment or decrement the values by the same amount.<br><br>Another issue you'll run into is that when you remove those draw images, ImagesCollide will never return true because they are not drawn.<br><br>A better solution would be to use bounding boxes to determine your collisions.  Basically, rather than check if the actual images are colliding, you assign a  box around each of your objects and see if the boxes overlap.  Although this is not a perfect collision, for most implementations of games it is close enough that it will work.<br><br>Lets have an example.  Say your Henry image is 50x100 pixels, and your door is 200x200 pixels.  We'll assume that H\x and H\y are Henry's x and y coordinates, and D\x and D\y are the doors coordinates.  Both will correspond to the top left corner of the image, as usual.<br><br>Now we draw an imaginary box around the images, one being 50x100 and the other 200x200.  To calculate if these boxes overlap, we want to see if:<br><br>1. Henry's X is &lt;= than the Door's X plus its width (its right edge)<br>2. Henry's X plus his width (the right edge) is &gt;= the Door's X <br>3. Henry's Y is &lt;= than the Door's Y plus its height (its bottom edge)<br>4. Henry's Y plus his height (the bottom edge) is &gt;= the Door's Y <br><br>The code would look something like this:<br><pre class=code>
If h\x&lt;=d\x+200 And h\x+50&gt;=d\x And h\y&lt;=d\y+200 And h\y+100&gt;=d\y

</pre><br><br>Draw some boxes in paint and look at the conditions.  You'll notice that all the colliding ones meet this, whereas boxes that do not overlap fail at least one of the conditions.  It's certainly an easier thing to visualize than to write about.<br><br>Its really late so I hope that is all correct, and I hope it makes a little sense.
