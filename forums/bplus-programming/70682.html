It is supposed to be simple, mostly text, with hack and slash thrown in the mix.  <br><br>However, I am having problems with my actual battle engine, and was looking for help.  Particularly on how to have the game actually detect which weapon the player has; so it can understand how much damage to do.   <br><br>I am a Dungeons &amp; Dragons player, pen &amp; paper style; and have borrowed the engine ideas from D&amp;D, as far as attacking.  <br><br>So for example, if the player chooses their weapon to be a 'bow' they would have the following type loaded.<br><br><pre class=code>Type Bow

damage = SeedRnd(1,8);the amount of damage done (1-8)</pre><br><br>They do 1d8 (1 die 8, an 8 sided die) of damage.  So randomly, 1-8 damage, + any additional modifiers from bonuses in the weapon itself.  <br><br>Here is the problem:<br><br><pre class=code>Print "What weapon would you like?  &lt;Bow, Dagger, Shortsword, Longsword, Rapier, Axe&gt;</pre><br><br>If they choose one of those weapons, how would I have the game understand which type they chose, to know how much damage is done.  That way, later on in a fight against a goblin it would say something like:<br><br><pre class=code>Print "You use your " + weapon$ + " to slash at the goblin, for a total of " + dmg + level + "."  </pre><br><br>In theory, that should say how much damage they did.  It adds the WEAPON's damage (it has to know which weapon it is, to know how much damage that weapon gets, i.e some have 1-6) to the player level, for additional damage.  <br><br>However, I do not know how to actually have the game understand which weapon it is and how much damage it does.<br><br>Anyone have a suggestion for game engines/battle engines?  Should I use types &amp; fields?  <br><br><b>I could have it so when they "Equip Bow" or "Equip Shortsword" it *sets variable dmg to 1d8 or 1d6*.  How, though, would I 'set' the variable 'dmg' to a specific number according to the weapon? </b> Thanks! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Can you explain?<br><br>If you could break down the array a bit more, and give an in game example for the get damage, that would be excellent.  <br><br>As of now, however I am milking this information for all I can get - and redoing the whole tutorial book (Game Programming For Teens Second Edition).  Sorry for the bombardment of questions, and ripping your code to pieces with them, but I obviously do not recall near as much as I had thought.  <br><br>Time to go back to the tutorial, any further help will be highly appreciative as it may decrease time needed to be spent *reading the whole book over again*.  :P<br><br>Nice website, btw, deps.

  field class$
  field hp
  field mana
  field mana_gain_time

; From time to time in your code:
update_character( player )


; Somewhere else
function update_character(  c )
