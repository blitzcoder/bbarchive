<table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr ><td class="posthead"><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr ><td >Vic 3 Babes</td><td align="right"><font class=tiny>(Posted 2007)</font>&nbsp;<a href="#1">[#1]</a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr ><td class="posttext"> This is really weird.<br><br>I just upgraded to BlitzPlus from Blitz 2D v1.8 and have discovered the following, and was wondering if there was anyone who could give me an explanation.<br><br>I know that BlitzPlus doesn't generate the same random numbers from the same seeds as Blitz 2D v1.8, and although this caused a few problems, there's nothing that can't be easily fixed.  However, whilst testing some old stuff, I discovered the following:<br><br>I wrote a routine called SeedCrypter.bb in Blitz 2D that encrypts a textfile.  I wrote this out of curiosity, just to see if it worked, not because I have any use for it.<br><br>The encrypter loads the textfile into a bank.<br>If it's an odd number of bytes, it adds a space to the end.<br>Then it peeks the first short (which is always within the range $909 to $7E7E) and finds a 2-byte seed that reproduces that short on the first attempt at generating a random number within that range.<br>It writes the seed into the bank over the old short.<br>Then it peeks the next short and repeats the process until it gets to the end.<br>Then it saves the encrypted bank.<br><br>The decrypter loads the bank, peeks each short seed and sets SeedRnd.<br>It then generates the 2-byte random number between $909 and $7E7E, poking it back over the 2-byte seed etc.<br>Repeating the process for each succesive short in the bank<br><br>This works perfectly in Blitz 2D with every text file I've tried (though I have realized recently that the British Pound symbol would be missed if it happened to be in the wrong byte.<br><br>However, BlitzPlus hasn't managed to encrypt a single text-file, or even simply phrase.  Here is a short version of the code to explain what's going on:<br><br>Graphics 640,480,0,2<br>SetBuffer BackBuffer()<br><br>shortascii=Asc("T") Or (Asc("h") Shl 8)<br>seed=-1<br>Repeat<br>	seed=seed+1<br>	SeedRnd seed<br>	randnum=Rand($909,$7E7E)<br>Until (randnum=shortascii) Or (seed=$FFFF)<br>If randnum=shortascii<br>	Text 0,0,"Seed="+Right$(Hex$(seed),4)<br>	Text 0,15,Chr$(randnum Shr 8)+Chr$(randnum And $FF)<br>Else<br>	Text 0,0,"No seed found"<br>EndIf<br>Flip False<br>WaitKey()<br>End<br><br>Blitz 2D can easily encrypt this entire textfile using this method - (I'm writing to a textfile, and will copy and paste it into the forum) - but BlitzPlus can't.  I've tried both Blitzes on several textfiles - Blitz 2D never fails.  Although BlitzPlus can encrypt the first two characters of this textfile "Th" - it can't do the next two "is", or "si" as it would be peeked - the endian format is really irrelevant, since Blitz2D can do it either way around.<br><br>It just seems really strange to me that Blitz 2D can encrypt several different textfiles, has never in fact failed to do so, when the different combinations of adjacent letter-placings must be humongous - yet BlitzPlus has never managed to get past 6 bytes in any textfile or phrase that I have tried.<br><br>This led me to conclude that BlitzPlus's random number generator doesn't produce as wide a spread of random numbers as Blitz 2D, so I wrote some code to compare the frequency of different random numbers generated in the above range with seeds from 0 to $FFFF.  Unless there was a bug in my code, the results were:<br><br>Blitz 2D v1.8 - 19563 different numbers<br>BlitzPlus - 19660 different numbers<br><br>The reason for the range in Rand($909,$7E7E) is because the code doesn't expect to come across 2-byte shorts of less than TabTab (ascii 9,9) or greater than ~~ (ascii 126,126).  I wanted to keep the range as small as possible to ensure more likelihood of getting a seed when I originally wrote it.<br><br>Here is an example of some the phrases I tried with BlitzPlus:<br><br>One man went to mow, went to mow a meadow. (failed at position 0)<br>Now is the Winter of our discontent made glorious Summer by this son of York. (failed at position 2)<br>I like to program in Blitz because &lt;in 10 words or less&gt; (failed at position 0)<br><br>If Depressed then Adjective$="Cruel" else Adjective$="Cool"<br>Print "Hello, "+Adjective$+" world." (failed at position 2)<br><br>I'm going to keep going until I find one that works (failed at position 0)<br><br>So statistically speaking, what are the chances - that Blitz2D always produces a seed that works, and BlitzPlus virtually never does.  It would suggest a bug in my code - but then why does it work in Blitz 2D, and why does the example code above demonstrate that it doesn't work in BlitzPlus, but works in Blitz 2D?<br><br>I really don't care about encrypting files - if I was, I wouldn't tell you the algorithm - but it's doing my head in, and I need to know why it doesn't work.  Can anyone see a logical reason?<br><br>btw - there were 4569 bytes including the last question mark, and Blitz2D encrypted them all. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
