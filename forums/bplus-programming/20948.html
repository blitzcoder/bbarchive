There were three main versions of Windows 95 released.  The first version of Windows 95 (upgrade for 3.1) that came out in the fall of '94 does NOT have DX capabilities, nor does the first OEM version.  The only version of Windows 95 that shipped with DX capabilities was the last OEM version which had IE4 and Active Desktop integrated.  <br><br>For these people to get DX, they have to download the 25MB file for DX8/9, pretty stupid for an application that has absolutely no use of DirectDraw and gains absolutely no benefit from using it.<br><br>Application (REAL applications and not game development tools) users and game players are two different markets.  People who do not play games, do not upgrade their systems very often, there is just no need to.<br><br><div class="quote"> Windows environment (at the moment)... why is a reliance on DX (if anything) bad? <br></div>I am not sure where you have been, but DirectDraw died many years back.  Microsoft officially pulled the plug on it back when DirectX 8 was being developed.  <br><br>I think the better question is to have somebody explain why you need to use DirectDraw to write an application (non game development tools)?  Everybody seems to forget that Blitz Plus is capable of turning out real applications.  Even the folks at Blitz forget this as it was quite noticeable that applications (nongame development tools) were NOT requested for the Blitz CD.<br><br>I do not share the "bloat because you can" theory of programming.  Artificially inflating the minimum requirements of a product just to use an outdated API that provides absolutely no benefit is silly, irresponsible and definitely not needed.<br><br>Dead technology is dead for a reason and the only languages out there dependent on DD have been game development languages, there is just no use for it in languages meant to develop applications.  Blitz Plus can do both, as does Jamagic which has been around for a long time and has always had the software rendering so apps do not have to use DirectDraw.<br><br>Software rendering (if done properly) is perfectly fast for 2D games (or apps), and Windows GDI is perfectly fine for applications.<br><br><div class="quote"> Just to help you decipher my tone, <br></div>Just so you can understand mine, I believe in programming ethics and I believe in being responsible in the work I do, and I believe in treating my customers with respect.  <br><br>It really bothers me to have to explain to the three beta testers that ran into a problem with my program after it had been ported to Blitz Plus as to why they now have to download a graphics API aimed at gamers just to use a simple program aimed at professional writers.  <br><br>People need to remember that Blitz Plus is capable of applications now, not just game development tools.  Personally, I waited a while before I bought Blitz Plus and I did not purchase it until I saw Mark state that Software/GDI modes would be coming in the future.<br><br>I am glad to see that coming into fruition :c) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

And its not always "little" companies running DOS based systems.  With companies, depending on the work they do, there is often no need to upgrade.  Even some of the poorer countries, their infrastructure is using DOS. Even in the private sector, there are likely more DOS/win 3.1 systems still in use than 32bit Win systems.  When the private sector gets rid of these old DOS systems, they are often "donated" and go into schools, libraries, various nonprofit businesses, etc.  Computers have a MUCH longer lifespan than people think.<br><br>Programmers, digial artists and diehard gamers are the only demographic that upgrade on a regular basis.
