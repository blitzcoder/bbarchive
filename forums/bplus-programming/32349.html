Object definition...
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Type Player

    Field x = GraphicsWidth () / 2
    Field y = GraphicsHeight () / 2

    Method Update ()
        If KeyDown (KEY_LEFT)  x = x - 1
        If KeyDown (KEY_RIGHT) x = x + 1
        If KeyDown (KEY_UP)    y = y - 1
        If KeyDown (KEY_DOWN)  y = y + 1
        Draw
    End Method

    Method Draw ()
        Rect x, y, 8, 8
    End Method

End Type

Demo usage...
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Graphics 640, 480

p:Player = New Player

Repeat

    Cls
    p.Update ()
    Flip

Until KeyDown (KEY_ESCAPE)
</pre><br><br>(Note that ':' is what replaces the current '.' and '.' replaces the current '\'... slightly off-putting at first but you'll get used to it.)<br><br>For those not familiar, 'methods' are basically just functions specific to the type, and can operate directly on the type fields (hence x and y in the methods above refer to the x/y fields of the Player type).<br><br>In the above example, I create an object of type Player (p:Player) and call its Update method in the main loop. The x/y fields are initialised to the centre of the screen when the object is created (optional).<br><br>The Update method above also calls the Draw method, partly just to show an example of more than one method, and partly because doing it this way means you can create different object types based upon this one ('extending' the type) and just have to replace ('override') the Draw method to make the new type draw differently:<br><br><pre class=code>
Type Rocket Extends Player
    Method Draw ()
        Oval x, y, 32, 32
    End Method
End Type
</pre><br><br>(So objects of type 'Rocket' have all the same fields and methods as 'Players' but the Draw method is changed.)<br><br>There's loads more to it, of course, and you can do some really powerful stuff, but I won't go any further since everything is subject to change.<br><br>Anyway, I've always hated OO because I feared it until now, but once you've done a little of this yourself, you'll probably find you want to keep doing things this way.

This is simply a "automaticmemory allocation" vs "dynamic memory allocation". In C++ you have both.<br><br>Here you are doing automatic memory allocation (the object is allocated on the stack if you're in a function, and "statically" allocated once for all if it's outside any function). If you prefer, here p is treated as a "value object", ie a bit like primitive types (int, float, string) but if you'd allocated it on the heap (that is, dynamically), it would be an whole different story.<br><br><div class="quote"> If I want to inherit things, then I guess the declaration needs to be more advanced than a simple "Player p;" <br></div>No, that's not that. It would very well work if Player was a derived classe. BUT, if you'd wanted to have "Player p" point to an "Enemy", you couldn't do it that way, at all. you'd have to allocate id dynamically (which will permit to have virtual methods working. With automatic allocation, it just doesn't work). So all in all, NO, it's not simpler in C++ (more powerfull, but you have to pay this power) as you have to <br>understand the differences between automatic and dynamic allocation and all the subtil implications.<br><br>In Blitz (like in Java btw) you only have dynamic allocation which is probably a good thing for such a language IMHO.<br><br><br>That said, there could very well be some kind of shortcut, a bit like you get an integer variable when you don't specify '%'. I'm not suer this would be any clearer though, and you still have to provide some proposition of good syntax for such a shortcut. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
