Again BlitzPlus hangs when you run this - I have heard something about that on these forums..<br><br>My point is - surely it should run the old code fine...<br><br>Also - why are these two observations above not put in print somewhere in the manual - in the migrating to BlitzPlus section for example.. <br><br>Its very frustrating to spend a while trying to track down what has changed in the compiler functionality....<br><br>Comments anyone? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Its a completely re-written leaner/meaner compiler that is heavily based on B2D but it has been re-designed to allow programs to be written that are windows applications rather than applications that can run under windows and also to run without being dependant on a specific version of DirectX being installed.<br>Mark has gone to a lot of effort to try and make it as backward compatible with the old language as possible and that seems to have given the impression its an upgrade to B2D.<br><br>If you look at the examples supplied and the tutorials you can see that the whole structure of a B+ program is very different indeed. Perhaps if the new language didnt bother trying so hard to make all the old Blitz commands available then it would not be so confusing.<br><br>I do agree that it would be nice to have a document distributed with B+ which explains any issues you may experiece when migrating code from B2D and what the solutions are.<br><br>Personnally all my old B2D applications I have I still continue using B2D to recompile. If I ever come across any application written in B2D that I wish to use in B+ then I would take a good long look at the core of the code and rewrite whatever parts of the app I need to make use of the messaging / canvases / menus / gadgets etc.<br><br>Of course when I find any old functions / libraries of code that would be useful in B+ I can salvage them and Im pleased that they require very little and usually no changes to compile them using B+.<br><br>Feel free to flame me if I am wrong.. I like a good grilling :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
