It simply uses an array to equate ASCII code to the appropriate location in an animstrip of letters (and I've got a version that includes kerning info, etc. too). <br><br>This works great for English and other roman-alphabet languages but it would get messier when you want to do extended character sets. <br><br>Has anyone done some kind of double-byte work like this in Blitz before?

Unicode has not really caught on yet, because it is extremely wasteful of memory, and there is only partial support in the Windows operating system for it at present.  But it seems certain to gain support over the long haul, and familiarity with it may serve you a good turn sometime in the future.<br><br>The big problem with Unicode is the fact that some language needs are going to be huge, such as with Chinese and Japanese, and there is no way to establish parity between dissimular languages.  Nobody has quite figured out how Unicode is going to work as a result.  Is the operating system suppose to "see" a chinese character in terms of its Unicode two-byte value, then figure out what that should translate to in some other language?  And if that is not the goal, then why bother with trying to create a uniform code in the first place?  And how does the basic character value maintain its many individual representations if we do not recognize different fonts as well?<br><br>Still and all, if this is where your interest lies, then I believe checking out what Unicode is and where it is going would put you in the main stream instead of on the fringe. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You'll add a bunch more when you start talking about a particular topic - such as technology, warfare, plumbing, etc.<br><br>As far as any kind of parity for exchanging info between languages - we can't even do that well between English/French/Spanish/German. I wish it were possible with Chinese and the other simpler (alphabet wise...I know, I know. Japanese has more complicated grammar than Chinese) Asian languages, but I doubt it'll be doable for some time.<br><br>I keep thinking about trying to do something in Chinese - hey, a whole bunch of people speak it after all - but whenever I do I just think of the technical junk to work out and shudder. <br>M <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The future of memory growth will probably be expodential through a number of technical innovations that are surfacing.<br><br>The problem is going to be referencing them.  How in the world are we to understand a system where the indexing has to relate to the imagry of a given symbol?  I believe that bit maps won't suceed here.<br><br>And instead of a 20x20 grid, and bitmaps, let's consider a system that responds to font and size issues.  I guess you are looking at something like a TrueType object.  It descrives the general form of the object, one that can be manipulated to produce the equivalent of Bold, Italics, Block form, Cursive, etc. fonts, and one that can bet stretched to be of any desired sise,  But it might need more than that, say the ability to return a meaning that is consistent with the inquiry - a german word or phrase if You query in german, and english word or phrase if in english, a spoken word of phrase on request,<br><br>Now you are talking about something that will have a HUGE demand on memory, processing power, and real-time adaptation.  Perhaps there will be universal language storage banks that house this stuff, and you can go online to download any language subset that you want.<br><br>I think that the limitations of a bit-map approach, as fundamental as it seems at first, become readily apparent when you really get into the project.  I think the future will belong the the person who looks beyond what he/she can do most easily and says instead:  "Now what we REALLY need is ..." and goes from there. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
