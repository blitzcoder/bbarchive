The machine is connected to the internet, so there are certain games with 'national' prizes. Games include stuff like 'WordSearch', 'Hangman' and 'Spot the difference'. They start off quite easy, thus drawing the player in (ooh, I'm gonna win!), but become VERY hard just before you reach a 'level' where you'd win any money.

Guess why?<br>    Because people were afraid of playing those, because they could not understand those games by just looking at them.<br>    Another thing is: your game must be completely self-contained in a single screen (and most likely, another simple screen for a bonus game).<br>    It압 not like "hey, the less features, the better".<br>    But it still is "hey, the less movement, the better".<br>    What I mean is that appealing graphics most definitely help, but pre-rendered graphics, handled as sprites are just fine.<br>    When a game has a 3d look, but no 3d functionality, these users tend to call it "oh, the 3d one".<br><br>See ya, <br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Rui Barbosa Jr.<br>P.S.: Please e-mail me at barbosarui@..., and I will create an e-mail account for you, on our server.<br>There are lot압 of info I앇 like to send you, about our company and about the market, but I am not allowed to release those to any account out of our mail-server. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

First, all the random system is difficult because you must calculate the winning BEFORE it is showed on the screen (that's due to government laws, like forced winning, etc..). Besides, usually such games have MANY settings (at least, my slot has something like 100 settings, chosen by the user) and it isn't easy to handle a game with all those parameters. Such settings are needed because casino's owners must be able to change many aspects of the same game according to customers tastes. And any casino can have different kind of people who go there to play.<br>There is all the custom hardware you must control, lights, special keyboard, coin receiver. You must think of a system that saves the current match most often than possible just in case the machine is switched off accidentally (players don't want to loose their money !). Then, it comes the game itself.. that can be relatively easy. A slot with 9 indipendent wheels can be difficult, especially as regards the winning calculation (and don't forget bonus screens, etc..). Also, wheels must seem to stop when the player presses the stop key, but they must stop when the program wants (that's because of what I said before, laws says that sometimes you must generate a certain winning).

The contents of the contract will only be disclose when that step is taken.<br>- After signing the contract, developpers will be supplied with confidential information, so yes, there will be plenty of legal jargon on it, so we suggest you ask for professional help BEFORE signing the contract. By signing it, you will be agreeing to all of its terms.<br>- The contract will be translated to english, so all contracts will be sent out in english, no matter what coutry you are at - even for brazilian devloppers, should that happen.<br>- Of course, developers must be ale to provide us with a list of used tools and prrof of purchase of such toolsm etc...<br>For example: if you use a graphics package to create something for the game, you must identify that package, and provide us some proof of purchase/registration, as we do not want to be involved with people who are using hacked versions of any software tool.<br>- Your games will have to be compatible with our hardware interface abd some external applications such as our game server technology, etc...<br><br>Now, for some specifics:<br><br>* First, we want everyone to choose one of the games in the following list:<br><br>Card Games<br>. Video Poker<br>  . Deuces Wild<br>  . Jacks Or Better<br>. Blackjack<br>  . Three types of blackjack will be needed<br>. Baccarat<br>. Roulette<br>  . American style<br>  . European style<br>. Slot machines<br>  . Several types.<br>    This is the kind of game you wull be able to apply all your criativity... provided the game results are generated by our government-auditable random number generator.<br>. Bingo games<br>  . Four Cards x 15 numbers x 33 + 3 balls<br>  . Six cards x 15 numbers x 33 + 3 balls, 42 + 3 balls<br>  . Four cards x 24 numbers x 33 + 3 balls<br><br>Games created by yourslef, which are ready to be converted to our requirements will also be considered.<br>But the companny REQUIRES you to register it with some legal authority, so you have some way to proof the game was designed by yourself.<br><br>All games must not rely on the players hability to play.<br>Fr games that involve strategy, it is important to allow fo a pure random outcome generation mechanism, yet it must implement an enable/disable flag for forcing GOOD results when the game is not paying the payback rate which it is advertised to be, due to lack of good tactics by the players.<br>This will only apply to places where this FORCING mechaninsm is required by law.<br><br>What we offer.<br>We can not disclose too much on a public forum.<br>So, this is what can be made publicly available:<br><br>- You get the option to coose a mix of per-copy PLUS a share of the profits generated by the companny.<br>- Let us know wjat you per-copy price is, privately. DO NOT post in here. People who do so, will not be considered for development.<br>- In case you do not charge a per-copy price, you will have a 5% to 10% share of the profits generated by your game - deppending on the cmplexity of the game.<br>A well written, aproved slot machin game, good-looking one, will most klikely to be offered around 7.5% share of th companny압 profits.<br>- Profits means the money made by the game, which is computed on a weekly/bi-weekly/monthly basis.<br>Machines which are sold will generate a one-time, bigger, profit.<br>Machines which are operated by our companny will generate a profit which is the result of the machines in-money less the out-money (coin-in - coin-out), divided by two, because the owner of the casino/bingo-hall gets half of it.<br><br>The deadline for choosing to join us is tomorrow, at 06:00PM, brazilian time.<br><br>BONUS GAMES:<br><br>Every game in the list mneds at least one bonus game screen.<br>Bonus games can be very simple, like: heads-or-tails, paper-scisors-stone, is-the-card-bigger-or-smaller?, is-the-next-ball-bigger-or-smaller? etc...<br><br>Deadline for delivering the completed games is June 5th, 2004.<br>Before we sign a contract, it is necessary tha people choose what game they want to develop.<br>It is not garanteeded that you wil be assigned the game you choose.<br>Please, e-mail your choice to<br><br>barbosarui@...<br><br>(Tomorrow, you will be provided another e-mail address, which will be directed to me).<br><br>Once you choose one of the games in the list, you will be givven one month to present an executable which at least resembles the game chosen.<br>It does not need good graphics.<br>And doesn앖 need to work properly.<br>But it is absolutely necessary that after that one month period, you have created some material that is decent enough to prove that you will be able to complete the game by June 5th, 2004.<br>If it takes you less than one month, even better.<br>But people who fail to release that in one month will lose the option to develop that game, which will be passed on, probably to someone who has already presented proof of skills for developing another game.<br>After we get that pre-pre-alpha-prototype, we will proceed to signing the contract.<br>It will then be necessary to have an hour-hour conversation on the phone, and ONLY THEN, communication will take place on the account which will be activated on our servers.<br><br>Please, let me know if you have any wuestions concerning this post.<br><br>We have a couple of screens of some games that are finished and working.<br>Can omeone please tell me how to post them here?<br><br>Yours truylly,<br><br>Marcos Bird<br>Development Coordinatior<br>F.W.G/Belro Comercial<br>Rio de Janeiro, Brazil<br>www.fwg.com.br<br><br>P.S.: All games bust be written in Blitz Plus.<br>No B3D or B2D - only B+ will be accepted.<br>We are not affiliated to Blitz Research nor do we get anything from them.<br>Te company has built its technology on top of Blitz3D and has modified it to work with Blitz Plus.<br>That압 the reason why only Blitz Plus games will be accepted. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I had a conversation with Rui this afternoon and he gave me some system specs for the end machines and some other info.  I thought you guys might be interested in seeing it so here it is: (edited (somewhat) for readability)<br><br>Rui says:<br>The games will run on Athlon 1.1 MHz machines with 128Mb RAM<br>VRAM is either 8 or 16Mb<br>depending on how much VRAM your game needs<br>we will pick th corresponding video card<br>Resolution will be 800 x 600 or 1024 x 768 --- your choice<br>color should be 16 bit per pixel<br>if your game runs well with 32, then it압 ok<br>but keep the hardware platform in mind...<br>We use 16 bits because somewhere in the B+ and B3D documentation, it says something like "try to use 16 bits".<br>That압 why we never used 32 bits, for instance<br>I am not sure how performance would be affected by 32 bits, though<br><br>the company has tried to go with old machines, but these are hard to maintain, so now we always use the cheapest CURRENTLY available configuration<br>this means that maybe tomorrow our platform will increase, because we no longer will be able to buy 1.1GHz machines... we may need to raise it up to 1.8GHz, for instance<br><br>We will provide you with all the graphics you need<br>the graphics will be created as required<br>for instance, let압 say you need a table, with 500 x 300 x 16 bits, for a blackjack game<br>all you앇 have to do is ask Riccardo, the lead designer, and he will assign that task to someone in the art department<br>but I encourage you to use placeholders for now.<br>but you are free to choose the item sizes as you need<br>you are the boss... you tell us what sizes and positions... we will just have to make sure the images will look good for the brazilian audience<br><br>just keep one thing in mind: every time you need to display a message inside of a box, for instance, that message probably is going to use more screen real-state than you originally thought.<br>that압 because all messages will have to be translated into portuguese. And portuguese sometimes uses long expressions...<br>actually, it sometimes DOES NOT use short expressions <br>so, "Hit" would become "Pede Carta"<br>And "Split" would become "Dobra a Aposta"<br>don앖 worry about translating messages. You won앖 have to deal with portuguese at all...<br>just keep in mind that message boxes should always be sized in such a way that we can translate the messages down here, and the translated message must fit the originally assigned box<br>A quick rule of thumb would be: make space svailable so you can write a message twice as long as the original one<br><br><br>Ron says:<br>Can I modify a graphic that you sent to me (such as the 500x300 suggested earlier) if I feel it will fit the game better?<br><br>Rui says:<br>feel free to use anything you want<br><br><br>Ron says:<br>Sounds are the same as graphics?  I ask you for a sound, you provide?<br><br>Rui says:<br>yes<br>if it is a voice message (should you want to use any), be aware that it is going to be in portuguese<br><br><br>file naming will be determined by yourself. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
