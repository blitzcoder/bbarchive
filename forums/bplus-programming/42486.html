Anything that you create (or in this case, could be 'record') is automatically copyrighted (unless it's a recording of something else copyrighted...).  Anything that someone else creates or records is automatically copyrighted by them.<br><br><div class="quote"> I cant wreally play my own sound at home either =)  <br></div>Of course you can.  There are plenty of freeware, shareware sound editing programs.  Use them.<br><br>If you have a microphone, you can make plenty of sounds yourself just with your own body or the things you have around you.  I for instance made a slot machine game and needed a sound for the coins dropping into the machine and coins being paid back to the player.  I achieved it by recording myself dropping quarters onto a tin can cover.  I recorded multiple samples and used the ones I liked.  <br><br>You can start with a sound like I did above and modify it by using the sound editors features to come up with even more sounds.<br><br>If you don't have a microphone, you can still find freeware sounds off of the net, and modify them to your liking.<br><br><br><br>P.S. wreally is spelled really <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Also BBC and Amiga 500/1200 and finally PC.  Used Blitz Basic on the Amiga of course, much better than Amiga Basic and AMOS etc.  Devpac (assembler) was great but much slower than Blitz to get results.  Good days. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

We had homeworks wich i loved to do and i always filled them with unnecessary features such as different colors and help-funktions just to learn a little extra at free will. Later on we had a year in school without programming but we were told to work with c++ the next year. I was eeger (dont know the word) to be a bit ahead everybody else so i planned to start programming on my spare time at home.<br><br>Offcourse all the proffesional programs were too expensive to me and i felt that since programming were so close to my heart i didn't want to use pirated programms. I needed to honestly say that i have bought theese programs and i could get help on the net.<br><br>I had to find some other program to prectis my skills with while we didn't have programming at school. I started with a demo of DarkBasic but moved on to BlitzBasic very quick as it was part of a PC-magazines cd.<br><br>With BlitzBasic me and a classm8 started developing a 2D-game simular to "Duke Nukem 2D" called Törmenäjtör. And we returned it to shool as a projekt-work (a 100hour projekt). We started from scratch and did it all our selfes (execpt the sounds) and we got the best grade !!!<br><br>Since this was a school-projekt copyright laws dont apply. But now i bought all Blitz-products and im working on making a new version of Törmenäjtör with my own sounds and all. Then im gonna use it as a way in to Collage to become a game-developer.<br><br>Right now im in the armmy so i dont have much time... But i have my visions. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
