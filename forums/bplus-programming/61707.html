I'm not bad as an algorist but writing interfaces is not my strong point.<br><br>You know how you usually assign a variable to a window or gadget as in<br><br>x=createwindow or createsomethingorother<br><br>and these x can be used in the logical processing of the gadgets. <br><br>Well, in a programme which repeatedly creates and frees the same windows, and optionally gadgets within them, in arbitrary sequence all over the place, is it not a good idea to set these variables to zero at the time of freeing their corresponding gadgets ?<br><br>Blitz seems to keep a sort of continuously changing stack of gadgets which reuses the same pointers with different gadgets. I had written a programme of the above type and it took me ages to find what was going wrong and why my main event loop was detecting action in the wrong gadgets.  Once I did the above trick everything seemed to work perfectly.<br><br>I haven't seen this specifically stated anywhere. Am I thinking correctly ? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

However it is useful to set it back to zero after successfully freeing an entity/gadget/object simply so that you have a way of identifying if the entity/gadget/object still exists.<br><br>I think you are thinking correctly regarding this. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Although I found out what was going on quickly enough by carefully studying with the debugger, I wasn't sure how to fix this and I was frustrated that BP assigns _the_exact_same_ number to two _different_ handles (of buttons, in my case).<br><br>Matty- I have found that it _does_ matter, and that you must specifically set the variables to zero after using FreeGadget on them (otherwise, two different variable handles will often/likely get the exact same number).  I'm pretty sure I can provide code to reproduce the problem, if you like.  Maybe I was doing something wrong in overall setup, but this was not intuitive and I think it should have worked.  Or, this should be noted in the FreeGadget command reference. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I had just this very minute reinstalled Blitz after my son formatted the hard disk. I was checking to see everything worked and there is your post from yesterday.<br><br>That damned thing kept me stuck for weeks because in my particular programme it was so intermittent. It's one of those things that are so obvious once you see them. I agree that a comment in the manual about it would not be out of place. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'd have figured that by now, an update would have provided _something_ more than what is there.  It's a wonderful product but that is very disappointing... I will try to go through some online here and try to help with what I've learned and experimented with on my own, but I think we deserve an update providing better documentation by now. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I thought I left a comment to the freegadget command saying some recommendation you set the handle to zero again but don't see it now (it's possible I left it under a different command help entry, but after searching I didn't find it).<br><br>If it was removed, it's not only an incomplete command reference in the product but we're kind of being robbed of charitably helping ourselves.  It's possible I could be wrong about all this and it was removed for a good reason (ie I don't understand something) but like I said it's not intuitive and I never got an explanation so this is strange. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
