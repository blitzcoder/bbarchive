At one point I came to thinking about ways to compress files without the common pattern searching system.  Around that same time, I was working on simple XOR encryption (I'm a hobbyist, not a pro so I don't stick to one project at a time).  I started mixing up the two projects in my mind and sometimes got ideas for one program while working on the other.  This confusion lead me to ask the following question:  "If you XOR'd a file enough times using varying lengths of bit masks, eventually would not all of the data inside be set back to 0's?"  If this is true then, I thought, it MAY be more space efficient to simply keep a small log of these XOR's than to use the standard compression methods.  Is there any life in this idea?  I know that it is a long shot, but I thought that it might be worth investigating...  Also even with the billions of calculations most computers today do a second, it might not be worth the lengthy compression time.  However, perhaps you could simply XOR the file just enough to bring out large patterns that the standard compresser could exploit.  What do you pro's think about this? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Lol but I did compare it to png format and mine was smaller in size and I can bulk up many images plus save extra bliz specific in them and still be small then a standard png format.  What you are talking about sounds interesting.  I hope you can work out the tech details and make it fly. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The whole question was, is there even a possibillity that this method of logging XOR's of the data would be a worthwhile compression method, though I'm not sure I explained the theory thoroughly enough...  This is how it would work.  You take a large file that you want to compress.  Then you just continue XORing the data (keeping track of the masks you XOR with in another file)  until all you are left with is 0's.  Then you also tack on the number of 0's to the end of the file.  This way, you can reconstruct the original file using only this "XOR map".  I'm sure that this would be possible (though highly time consuming during the compression process) but might this actually be able to output a "XOR map" file SMALLER than the original file? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

One thing though: the file should indeed (in my opinion) be smaller than the original, but I'm wondering...<br><br>Did you, by any chance, have any thoughts on how to DEcompress the file? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Once you have the file's size, all you have to do is xor in a reverse manner.  Therefore, you need to store which xor patterns you used in the reverse order you used them.  Think of it like a rubik's cube.  Start out with an unsolved cube and write down directions on how to solve the cube.  Once the cube is solved, if you follow the directions in a reverse manner, you get back to the original unsolved cube.  Therefore you have to  write a program to "solve" the file in the shortest way possible, "writing down the directions" for each xor it must use.  Then you can backtrack through the directions to get the file back to the original "unsolved" state. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
