However none seem forthcoming and doubtless there will be any if it is of the opinion that B+ is complete. WinBlitz seems more complete than B+. <br>Before anyone gets the wrong impression... I didn't say I don't like B+. I do like using it and especially B3D. Anything that puts a wrapper between me and the windows api is a goood thing. However B+ is lacking in areas that other "basic" languages provide. That is disappointing to me because I am an avid Blitz user and bought the product in good faith.  I've invested alot of time learning this form of basic and lothe the prospect of learning the subtlies of other forms of basic. (i.e. BlitzMax which is an entirely different paradigm)  Who's to say if I purchase BlitzMax and invest time and money in that product that it won't be abandoned for the next greatest flavor that is developed.  <br>Exactly why is wxMax far more complete, as stated above,<br>and why are these thing were not included or upgraded in Blitz+.
