The basis is good but there are a lot of games like this, adding something original is also important. On the other hand if it plays good, it plays good. ;) To be more clear, as you are asking "is this good or bad", I think it's good, but it could need some changes in speed/movement/difficulty.<br><br>Edit: my "review" wasn't completely fair as I only played the first 2 levels earlier. In later levels there is more variation in the enemies, reminds me a bit of classic games like Phoenix where you also have to face wave after wave of enemies every time with a different pattern or type of enemy. Still, the point I made about too many bullets I still stand by! :) Aaaaaah... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
