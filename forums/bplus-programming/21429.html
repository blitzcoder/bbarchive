Below is the code which any 1 can use or abuse. ( I might put an artical on BC if any 1 wants to know how it works), any way I need an idea of wether I should use it in My Alphabreed Game, Here are two pics to help you decide until I can get a demo out.<br><br><img src="http://www.jabawokie.ukgamers.net/areaofsight.png"><br><a href="http://www.jabawokie.ukgamers.net/sight.bb" target="_blank">http://www.jabawokie.ukgamers.net/sight.bb</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Like the <br>case above the player where the room to the right is dark, <br>and to the left it is bright, and the alien which is in the <br>middle is partly visible. Shouldn't the line be diagonal, <br>based on the location of the player? If not, what happens <br>if the player moves "up" a little bit, will the line stay <br>the same and then suddenly disappear, making the room to <br>the right visible as well? That would be a bit unrealistic.<br><br>It is more noticable for the small corner of the room the <br>player is in, on the right side, where the red object is;<br>this space should be entirely visible to the player, but<br>in the "area of sight" version, it seems to be completely<br>in the darkness.<br><br>Also the alien being only partly visible looks a bit <br>strange, like it is coming from under the floor.<br><br>So, summing up I think I would not use this system. Maybe <br>a better idea is to use a "line of sight" system so that <br>you can calculate more accurately which enemy is visible <br>and which is not.<br><br>Here's a "line of sight" function I wrote with a demo:<br><br><a href="http://www.oprit.rug.nl/prins13/download/lineOfSight.zip" target="_blank">http://www.oprit.rug.nl/prins13/download/lineOfSight.zip</a><br><br>Although when you use line of sight the downside of course<br> is that the rooms will still look the same (no darnkess).<br>I remember having seen games (both old games and BB games)<br>that do use this "area of sight" technique but in such a<br>way that the areas are formed in a more realistic way, even<br>if this means that you get "blocky" edges (since the<br>"resolution" of drawing these areas is the size of the<br>tiles). In fact you could use "line of sight" on the tiles <br>to get this effect... This is (was?) often done in RPG <br>games, typically those classic dungeon exploration games.<br><br>Then again, maybe the system you have there does work out<br>really well when you actually play the game, it could be<br>that the things I pointed out about the screenshots are not<br>really a problem when playing. And making the rooms bright<br>or dark does make it clear what you can and cannot see; <br>using "line of sight" on *only* the enemies has the big<br>disadvantage of the enemies popping out from nowhere.<br><br>(This is typically a problem in 2d games I guess; in 3d the<br>enemy would just be invisible since it is behind a wall; in<br>2d the area behind the wall *is* visible but the enemy is <br>not; your solution is to make that area dark) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Some people like that and some people don't, plus whether or not it is even necessary depends on your game.  Speaking for myself, I don't like that for a straight action game but for a more strategic game obscuring the player's vision is an important part of the strategic gameplay.  I guess this is because finding/avoiding enemies isn't really a goal in a simple action game, the point is fighting them, whereas in a strategy game (or at least a more strategic action game) needing to figure out where things are because you don't know from the get-go is a primary goal.  Now that I think about it this distinction carries over for me into 3D games; I don't enjoy FPS games that are all action if I don't know where my opponents are (eg. I enjoy "Halo" more with radar than without) but in more strategic games (eg. slower paced FPS games which tend towards stealth and sniping) I do enjoy creeping around looking for stuff. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
