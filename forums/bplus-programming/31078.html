Here is why...<br><br>Your program is small and uses very little memory per loop, and therefore your look-up table is stored in the L1 high speed memory cache. However, depending on the size of your program and how much memory it uses in each loop, your lookup table could be outside the L1 high speed memory cache (or even outside the L2 cache). Because your test program is small enough to fit in L1 cache, the values you are getting are not accurate (unless your game is going to be very small).<br><br>To get a more accurate set of values, you need to operate on an amount of memory greater than your L1 and L2 caches in each loop. Try creating a one million value array, and incrementing each slot every loop along with using your Sin and Cos array. Or, try doing a lot of graphics manipulation in each loop.<br><br>On my older machine, when using a lot of memory so that the array exists outside of the cache, on the fly and lookup tables are almost exactly the same.

They can't post example code because that would mean posting the code for an entire game or application.<br><br>So, yes, lookup tables are technically faster, but in a real-world application it would be the difference between spending, say, 3.55 milliseconds per frame on calculations as opposed to 3.58.

However, only for part of it. It was for a routine that performed alot more than just a SIN calculation, and sometimes did it many times per loop. I precalculated the whole formula and stuffed it into a bank. It had an impact, I'd estimate, of about 6% or so, largest case. When I tried substituting the simpler stuff with SIN tables, I couldn't even tell if it was making any difference. If it was, it was so insignificant compared to what else was going on, I simply couldn't tell. I could create a few test programs, but they wouldn't necessarily accurately reflect a real-world scenario.<br><br>So yeah, I suppose if I was doing a humungous number of SIN calcs, especially as part of a larger equation, I would most likely precalculate the entire equation. But to be honest, it will depend upon the program and how heavy the usage is as to whether or not tables are worth bothering with. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That Sin/Cos test is not a game engine, and as such is not a valid response to the original question, which related to the use of those functions within an actual game.  Think of how many benchmarking tools actually use code from real programs or game engines to provide a more realistic result.<br><br>To accurately test whether look up tables would be faster than the processor's own functions, you would have to take all cache levels out of the equation, or ensure the caches were adequately flooded with data as would be representative of a real world game engine.<br><br>In a real world engine it is unlikely that the lookup table would be stored long term in the cache, and thus on a processor from Pentium level up, using lookup tables would most likely be SLOWER than using the internal functions, which are performed in few cycles.  To load the lookup data from system RAM would actually take several processor cycles (processors being massively faster than RAM) and as such is far less efficient in reality for most cases.<br><br>Thus the need to profile your code to find out where the true bottlenecks are.<br><br>If however your target market is the 386SX, or your main loop and program code consists largely of Sin and Cos calls, by all means use lookup tables.

The initial post used decimal angles, so presumably more accuracy is required for that poster.<br><br>The large array was intended to make the test depend upon memory speed also.  Unfortunately as pointed out before, 360 elements is small enough to fit in most caches.  Running your test on my Athlon 1700 with all cache disabled yielded near identical results under Blitz3D (the lack of cache also made the machine slow as hell.)<br><br>Your observation of it being only 9 times faster is due to the fact the array is no longer being read sequentially, as I noted above.<br><br>The massive performance differences between Blitz3D and BlitzPlus aren't encouraging.  I wouldn't mind knowing what's behind that.<br><br>For a potentially larger lookup table, under more realistic conditions (within in a game) and for Blitz3D, there appears to be little reason to use a lookup table.  Under BlitzPlus, the real performance is similar within a realistic game environment.<br><br>If you are using only 360 elements under BlitzPlus, and calling a _lot_ of trig functions, I'd recommend using a lookup array at this stage.  Over more elements, the array overhead makes it less worthwhile though.<br><br>For those using tens of sin or cos calls with a loop, the results here at least would indicate using a lookup array is a bit of a waste of time, changing your code to do only 1000 iterations should be proof enough of that.<br><br>Your best bet, as myself and others have repeatedly pointed out, is to profile your code to see which bits are performing poorly, and act accordingly. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
