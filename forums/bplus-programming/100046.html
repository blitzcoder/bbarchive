I've read that Functions can be considered little programs within a program.<br><br>Should a programmer avoid using Goto? I think it's okay to use in a small simple program, but in larger more complex project it would not be wise. <br></div><br><br>I have several points I'd like to make here:<br><br>1) If you don't understand functions to the point where you're using them fluently and without thinking, <i>drop everything</i> and go and learn them. <b>Now.</b> Stop reading this post and pick the rest up later. If you don't know functions, <i>you can't program</i>: functions are <i>the</i> fundamental unit of program logic (from a design point of view, Goto can only exist in terms of functions; <i>variables</i> have no meaning without functions). Goto was historically a <i>substitute</i> for functions in archaic dialects of BASIC that couldn't support them properly. Functions are the "real thing".<br><br>2) There is <i>literally</i> no reason to ever use Gosub. Pretend it doesn't exist. It has no advantages whatsoever. Gosub in particular exists in Blitz solely to help coders coming in from older dialects to port their old code. Using Gosub is the fast way to creating unreadable rubbish: it's worse than Goto.<br><br>3) The main time one would use Goto is in generated code that you can formally prove will be correct because it's been created by machine. In small programs you will <i>never</i> need it, because small programs have simple enough logic to navigate properly with the normal control structures. So if you find yourself thinking "this is small, it's OK" - you're doing it backwards. Goto is an "escape hatch" for ultra-<i>complex</i> logic that you probably shouldn't be hand-crafting. (In the same way that Goto is a machine code operator: the CPU uses Goto a lot, but we don't need to think about it when writing loop syntax and it may as well not exist for design purposes.)<br><br>4) There is one common control operator "continue" that exists in many languages but not Blitz Basic (it got put into BlitzMax). You'll see Goto being used occasionally to fill this niche in ported code. A lot of people think this doesn't "count" since it's always used in a very rigorous way to replace a specific kind of controlled jump, and the source they're copying from has proven it's safe by using the built-in version. Use discretion here. (Of note: "continue" is nice but never essential, you can always restructure the loop to not use it, so for my part I don't do this.)<br><br>4.5) Similarly some people (notable example is the Linux kernel) use it to imitate "catch" blocks for cleaning up after error conditions at the end of a complex block of code instead of handling errors in the middle (similar to Floyd's example). Again, this is patching over an idea inherited from other languages, and should not occur naturally in idiomatic, normally-designed Blitz code.<br><br>5) There really is no divide on this issue. The controversy was back in the 70s and the pro-Goto side lost hard. No competent programmer will <i>ever</i> recommend the use of Goto in hand-written code for anything but patching missing features of the language, and when someone does recommend it, <i>that's a universally-recognised warning sign</i> that they don't know what they're talking about.<br><br>6) You <b>don't need it</b>. The basic control structures - and more importantly, functions - are enough to express any possible logic flow you could want. You will become a better coder if you embrace and learn to use them rather than relying on a crutch from the old world. Eventually, you'll stop thinking of how to make up for Goto and instead start just writing in terms of the new constructs. Most modern programming languages don't even include it: BlitzMax removed it; the only mainstream language that has it that I can think of offhand is C, and that's ancient.<br><br>7) Goto's efficiency is a red herring. The hoops you have to jump through to actually get any kind of meaningful control over it will completely rob your code of efficiency and clarity. The built-in control structures already emit the most efficient code to do the things that they do..!<br><br><br>TL;DR: Avoid it <i>like the plague</i>. The answer for newcomers is a firm "no". It's <i>not</i> OK.<br><br>Advanced users may be able to come up with corner cases (e.g. the aforementioned machine-generated source code, or hacks around features from other languages: are you seriously doing such things?), but that's getting into the territory of where rules are already breaking down anyway. Until you're able to <i>prove</i> to yourself (in the formal sense!) that you really need it because you've been over all of the other options, you don't need it.<br><br>In the meantime, please please please learn to use functions and you'll quickly forget this whole discussion. Functions are infinitely more powerful, and are the logical basis for 100% of programming constructs.<br><br><br>I apologise if this comes over as harsh (it is harsh). But the truth is that this is an old, old, <i>resolved</i> debate with one correct answer that you really need to accept and move on from in order to develop as a programmer, and I want to make this point crystal clear. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Gosub/Return is the nearest alternative to that, but you don't want to be doing that either - I once saw an entire game written with Gosub/Return instead of functions (Idigicon's "Derby Day", written by some guy from Lancashire if memory serves).  What Goto does, is jump immediately to another section of code without adding anything to the call stack.  If you use Goto excessively it will be next to impossible to debug your code, as you'll have to manually back-pedal to figure out where the code execution came from.<br><br>As has already been said, Goto has one single, practical use, and that is for jumping out of complex nested loops.  Sure, there are other ways but Goto is the quickest and cleanest way and the end-user isn't going to know or care whether you used Goto or not.  Never used pointers as above so can't comment on whether that's useful or not.<br><br><div class="quote"> The main reason why not use Goto is that nowadays programming languages arent bound to the line numbers. <br></div>That's got nothing to do with it.

The first example is a completely invalid case. Use 'Exit' to leave a loop. Goto is contributing literally nothing to this example.<br><br>2. There is usually no conceptual reason why search code and action code should appear in the same function. So the first example would be better served if the search code and the result-processing were factored out into different functions and composed at the point of use. By putting these two unrelated tasks in the same function and asking how Goto can unravel it, you're not just looking for the wrong answer but <i>asking the wrong question</i>.<br><br>3. Your second example is incredibly confusing and, with all appropriate respect, that is the exact kind of tangled code people are suggesting you could avoid writing if you stopped using Goto. That isn't an example of "Goto done right", it's a solid argument against using it. That code <i>is</i> the legendary spaghetti!<br><br>And yes in the case of no. 2 the answer is again to factor the code out into functions each of which deals with one coherent logical unit of the task (the very fact that you're using labels to simulate multiple-use of code is <i>proof</i> of this: you've re-invented functions in a very messy way). Have a single base loop that iterates over the entire group of trees to place; have it call out to another function to get the randomised position data with any other internal loops hidden inside that other function because knowing how they work is irrelevant to the operation of the base.<br><br>General tips:<br><br>- put each task in its own function<br>- when a function's task is visibly dividing into two separate tasks, split it (e.g. Your find-and-process example should either be a find function that calls a process function then immediately returns, or a generic find function whose caller composes it with a process function).<br>- when loop structures are more than two tabs deep, split the deeper parts out into sub functions<br>- there is <i>no excuse</i> for ever interfering with the number of iterations of a loop by manually creating an inner loop that Gotos around the outer... Just <i>ugh</i>, how did you even come up with something so complicated for such a simple problem?<br>- when a function is more than 75% of one screen long, refactor it into multiple functions that fit<br>- <i>always</i> share common code between two sites by factoring it out into a shared function<br>- don't be afraid to write lots of functions. There's no reason <i>not</i> to use them!<br>- functions are fast. Do not worry about performance.<br><br><br>So, the final answers are:<br>- your example code is a great example of just how bad Goto-driven code can be. It is a perfect example of the sort of mess you want to avoid<br>- the correct solution is indeed to write more functions. There is no reason why doing this would be a problem. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
