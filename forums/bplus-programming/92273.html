The path to the temp folder varies, and depends on the OS and browser used.<br><br>Note that many people aren't comfortable running .exe's straight from the web, and there's a lot of antivirus programs that will prevent a .exe from launching from the temp folder as well since it's a common virus attack vector.<br><br>If you mean run a game *in* a webbrowser (similar to online flash games), then you'd need a 3rd party wrapper product that can do this for you, such as OSAkit (not sure if it's still available)<br><br>Finally, bmx2 (currently under development) is supposed to have the ability to export to some web-friendly formats that can be published directly, but this is still under development and not currently available. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

My games run on XP from a D:\ drive location.  They are coded to do this.<br>What do I need to do to code them to run from an osakit file on a website?<br><br>What code must be used for the path to art/accessory files?<br>I downloaded the osakit demo and it showed a game having files in the folder.  How must my game be packed to work?  Who would know?<br><br>Someone told me not to "hard code" my art to a path eg.  D:\gameart1.  What else can you do??<br><br>I would like to learn to do as much of this myself as I cant  as it is costly to use a product.<br><br>The osakit demo took 1 second to "make a file"  from a .zip file is it just setting up to run from an osaplayer?  <br><br>Is this the same for flash/flash player.  You code for the playere of the product you use/buy?  Is this the same for java, flash and osakit?  Code for and then use their player? <br><br>Thats alot for now.

You have it installed in d:\games\super. To launch it, you'll run d:\games\super\super.exe<br>Inside that game, you tell it to load 'images1\image1.jpg', it will then automatically try to go to the <b>subfolder</b> called images1, and load image1.jpg<br>It's the same thing as if you would have told it to load 'd:\games\super\images1\image1.jpg', but you can ignore the first portion of that altogether and as a bonus benefit it means that your game is no longer tied to that drive and subfolder structure.<br><br>How it works from within a wrapper may be a different matter though: I would think it should, but the wrapper may have its own special rules you need to adhere to. Can't help you there.<br>(Using incbin is definitely recommended though, so at least you can make the whole thing self-contained inside a single executable file with no external dependencies) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
