If you're good at math, this is a quadratic function; what you're doing now is a linear function (none of that really matters, but I thought I might add it...). <br><br>So now for the code. First make a variable. Call it something like "jump" or something like that.<br><br>Second add another field to the "h" type and call it "yvel" or "yvelocity".<br><br>Then add the following code in place of your current jumping code.<br><br><pre class=code>

    If jump = 1   ;make sure jump = 1

        h\yvel = 10   ;NOTE: change this number to make him jump higher or lower

        jump = 0  ;this will prevent jumping again until he hits the ground

    EndIf

EndIf
</pre><br><br>Then at the beginning of the game loop, put the following:<br><br><pre class=code>
h\y = h\y - h\vel ;this moves him up by whatever h\yvel is

h\yvel = h\yvel - 1  ;NOTE: change the "1" to something else to make him rise and fall faster or slower

</pre><br><br>Finally, change the ImagesCollide before the jumping code to match this:<br><br><pre class=code>
If ImagesCollide(HENRY,h\x,h\y,0,PLATFORM,(b\x + p\x),p\y,0) Then 
	
	    h\y = 300

This happens so fast, though, it usually looks just like he's landing perfectly.<br><br>I know this kinda sounds like a lecture (believe me, I'm falling asleep while <i>writing</i> it, so I fixed your code and included it below.
