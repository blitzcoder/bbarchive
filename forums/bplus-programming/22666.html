Is the language the same as Blitz 3D, but with additional commands and/or a different event model (I seem to remember the events changing)?<br>Could you list some examples if syntax/commands have changed.<br><br>2. How easy is it to develop non game software, that could be created using VB or Delphi? I guess it's not as quick, but is it relatively close or time consuming to implement the UI?<br><br>3. What's the performance benefit for the 2d gfx routines? I assume there is no performace gain for general commands?<br><br><br>I've got a few 2d games (half finished) written in Blitz 3D and am wondering about moving them to Blitz+<br><br>Thanks! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Its the same as Blitz Basic, but with GUI commands in it.  Also, BlitzPlus is still seeing updates, Blitz Basic isn't.<br><br>2. I personally find it very difficult due to the lack of a form/window editor.  All the gadgets have to be placed manually, in code, and it seems like a lot of trial and error to get stuff in the right place.  Its crying out for a form editor like the one in PureBasic.<br><br>3. I don't really code much 2D stuff any more, so I don't know.  I have heard people say that BlitzPlus runs stuff very slightly faster than Blitz Basic though.<br><br>The best thing you can do, is download the BlitzPlus demo and try your Blitz 2D game code in it.  It should work with very few (if any) modifications. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I had finally reached a point where I shelled out the cash and bought myself a copy of VB, and thats right when blitzplus was released(which I bought as well). VB is still sitting in the box, while I tend to use b+ on a daily basis.<br><br>The main love for me is, its still the blitz syntax. I had looked at vb, purebasic, and delphi-- I have nothing against them but I rather stick to as few languages as possible :) Once you get your head around the additional gui commands, its all good.<br><br>I've got a form editor that *should* be done soon. I just can't stand setting up the layout of my windows in code. Its tedious, and If you want to make changes later on...GRRR.. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

All the old BlitzBasic commands are still there (with the v1.34 patch) so you don't have to make the dive into events straight away - but it's worthwhile figuring them out.<br><br>I havn't noticed any speed improvements personally but many others have.  However I get a nice speed increase from the newly added OpenGL mode. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
