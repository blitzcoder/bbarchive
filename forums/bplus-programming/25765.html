I can only assume that it is a problem specific to laptops, or his type of laptop (Sony VAIO, with windows XP), as it runs perfectly on my friend's desktop computer (which also uses windows XP) and my desktop computer (which runs windows 95). Antother problem is that the music does not play (it's in midi), whereas it does on my friend's computer and mine. I tried copying the files from the CD to the hard drive, but it had no effect. It was still VERY slow with no midi music. I'm assuming that this is something to do with the laptop (or laptops as a whole), as my friend has windows XP and it runs perfectly, or something to do with Pentium 4s, as my friend has a pentium 3. Does anyone know what the problem is? I'm hoping it is a laptop-only problem, because that would mean it'll run on desktop machines, which most of my friends and my "audience" have desktops. Please help me! This is a worrying problem!<br><br>I use Blitz Basic 2D, in case that helps. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Most laptops have pretty barebones graphics and audio support (even from brands you might associate with multimedia, such as Sony).<br><br>The best laptop video options are (best first) FX 2 Go (the portable version of the GeForce FX video card), Radeon Mobility, and Geforce 2 Go. Anything else is probably going to be pretty lame (although you may find some older ATI controllers that don't utterly suck).<br><br>I have a two year old Dell laptop which has a (then bleeding edge) Geforce 2 Go video card with 32MB of VRAM -- I can run the current version of EverQuest ... barely. (EverQuest may not look like much, but its recommended system requirements are 512MB of RAM and a 64MB video card -- having 100 2000-polygon characters on screen simultaneously is a challenge for most GPUs.)<br><br>By the way: laptops are slower than desktops for a LOT of reasons, not just video hardware:<br>1) Slow hard disks. A *fast* laptop hard disk runs at 5400rpm.<br>2) Slow busses. A fast laptop bus runs at 266MHz, vs. 800+MHz for a fast desktop.<br>3) Power/heat saving circuitry (e.g. they often run the processor slow to save power OR heat dissipation).<br>Typically, a laptop of a given clock speed will run 30-60% slower than a desktop of the same clock speed.<br><br>(Slightly off topic: our local Costco is selling a Sony Vaio desktop with a 3GHz HT P4, DVD-R, 17" LCD, etc. -- beautiful machine -- but it has a GeForce MX 440 video card -- essentially a state of the art machine all round with a 2 year old video card. Still, you could just toss the video card :) ) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Well.. my main game isn't frame-rate indipendent (I mean I wait for the actual vertical-blank of gfx-card), but gfx routines and code in general is very optimized and it actually gets the best FPS value for a certain refresh rate: for example on that old P-II the refresh rate is set at 120Hz and my game does 120FPS. On my friend's laptop (that has NOT shared memory) , it does 60FPS on a common 60Hz LCD monitor. Instead on my laptop (with SHARED memory) the refresh is set at 60Hz, but it does 56/57 FPS. That means my laptop is slow. This is with Blitz2D. I tried the B+ demo and it seems I have the same FPS but it runs much more smoothly (at least as general impression). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
