The GUI designer is the way it is for several reasons.<br><br>1) It was developed on early beta's of BlitzPlus, so some of the functionality you take for granted now wasn't there. (The ability to track the X/Y on a form and tell which window is active spring to mind).<br>2) It was rushed through to get onto the release CD.<br>3) It was intended as an example starting point for developing your own GUI designer (i.e. it's not the official GUI designer, hence why it's in an examples folder with the source included and not on the front page). <br><br>Several people have made 'comments' about the example GUI designer. Perhaps rather than UNconstructive criticism, people could suggest improvements, or even improve upon it themselves. <br><br>Nigel's GUI designer is a good example of doing something constructive. Too many people are ready to critic something they are getting as an example (for free), without contributing anything positive in that area themselves. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Does that make it worthless too? Yup, to them.<br><br>Perhaps more people should take this thread to heart as an example. <br><br>Over the years I have noted that there are many good people in this community, some of which are slated and disliked purely on the basis that they don't seem able to put things in a tactful way, or are a little too proud at times to admit they should have put a little more thought into something they said. <br><br>I've never had a problem with Brice, neither do I believe that I am 'Kinda Sad' or intend to get 'bent out of shape' over it either (Getting a little too personal with those statements I think, for someone I don't know!). <br><br>Bottom line is, I suppose, "You can disagree without being disagreeable".
