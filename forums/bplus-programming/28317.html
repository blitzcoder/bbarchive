I had done some troubleshooting with one of these people but it was inconclusive as to where to problem was but it appeared to be crashing during the creation of the menus.

BlitzPlus (and BlitzBasic/Blitz2D) works perfectly on my TabletPC actually (I've tried all the demoes, and all my own code), only Blitz3D applications fail, and only if not run from the IDE with debugger enabled. It's mind-numbingly odd.<br><br>If you need people with TabletPC's to test your application, just send an e-mail in my general direction.<br><div class="quote"> First, does anyone know if the screen of the "TC1000 C5800" (transmeta cpu/hp-compaq brand) is good? <br></div>What a coincidence, that's the exact model I have! I think the screen is very good, but some people have complained about the glass sheet that protects the screen having a rough surface, which gives a slight prismatic distortion effect on the screen, that can be very visible up close on very bright images. The pen also has a few short commings, for on, it's not pressure sensitive, and it also requires a battery (that'll last you about a year or so if you use it regularly 4 hours a day). Also the speed is somewhat less than you'd be accustomed to, and the GeForce2Go tends to get rather hot (although not uncomfortably so). It'll run Quake3Arena, and the built-in WiFi card is damned handy if you happen to be near an access point. It doesn't have a CD drive or disk drive, so you'll need a 'compact flash' or USB flashdrive to exchange files with non-networked computers. Ofcourse having two USB ports, you can always just buy an external CD drive. I have an Iomega Predator, which is pretty good, except it's not (particularilly) bootable. Also Compaq/HP in their infinite wisdom decided that the system restore installation comes on CD. Pretty useless for a computer that doesn't have a CD drive. What where they thinking?!?<br><br>Having said all that, I have no regrets about buying mine. It's a great little handy thing to have along and the unit itself wieghs in at about 1300 grams, and is roughly the same size as an A4 document binder. It's quiet and holds power for a long time. It'll definately change the way you work. You might want to try out the newer TC1100, which unfortunately comes with a Centrino processor, but has a battery-less, pressure sensitive Wacom pen.<br><br>Anyway if you find a good shop, I'm sure you can get someone to demo both models to you so you can make up your own mind. I recomend it, but if you do decide to get the TC1000, you might want to wait a bit, as once HP start really pushing the TC1100, the TC1000 is gonna be much cheaper, I'd wager. :o&gt; <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Intel kinda screwed up with the whole Pentium-M cpu moniker as it really doesn't share the P4 core nearly enough for it to be so closely associated with the P4.  They should probably call it a pentium 5 or even have associated the Centrino name with the chip as everyone else is doing anyway.  :)<br><br>Kanati <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
