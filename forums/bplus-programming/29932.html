Well, I don't know if 'anyone' is the correct word, but I and at least a few others have not been able to get a response from you since you got back and we haven't been able to catch you on MSN Messenger either.<br><br>You obviously are still capable of reading and posting to this forum so what's going on?  Is this casino game venture still 'on' or what?<br><br>If there is trouble with your email or instant messaging service or if you are too busy with other business then it really would help the rest of us if you notified us of that being the case either through these forums (which we all often browse) or perhaps by calling us directly (I know you have MY phone number).<br><br>Not communicating at all is irritating to say the least and at this point is prompting me to just call it quits.  This is not something I would like to do considering I have over a months work invested in this.<br><br>I am sure you can understand the reason I don't call YOU is because I am not going to invest (by paying an international phone bill) any more into this 'business venture' unless I am sure that I will eventually get something back out of it.  Lack of communications is not helping convince me that I will get something back out of this, especially since before Dec 27, I was able to contact you at least every other day if not every day.<br><br>I spent another 2 1/2 hours trying to catch you on Messenger today but was unsuccessful as well as writing you two emails.<br><br>I cannot do anything more (and haven't been able to for a month now) until we talk and you send me the hardware documentation and source code files.<br><br>??? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
