May come in handy, may not but will give me a good idea on how blitz is structured which is always useful to know.<br><br>I'm not reassured to know that things are not great for Monkey.  It's a shame really, I have to say personally that it's not my thing - for I'm not much into tablets; I'm more of a traditional PC bloke.  But I can totally understand there must be a very good market out there for it, it's the thing of today.  Shame Monkey apparently is not getting the press it deserves; for I'm sure the ground it covers must be as vast as with the previous BR releases.  Stiff upper lip, and all the best to you Mark in any case.  I have been a blitz follower ever since I bought BB for the Amiga and was so glad it came out for PC years later.  I'd be sad to see BR let it all go.  Must say, from a programming point of view I would definatly like to see B3D's code released but that would mean you wouldn't sell it anymore.  Don't burn your bridges if you don't have to.<br><br>As you may or may not know, I have been working on a dx9 /dx11 version of b3d for the past six months (Called 'hardwired' - link below).  I have got pretty far with it so far, and have covered many b3d commands.  If ever I get to a complete and stable state with this project, and if it interests you of course you could always think about integrating this into b3d to give it a new facelift.  If it could bring new life into b3d sales.  This would be much more enticing to potential programmers than to stick with just directx 7 capabilities.  Be great to see an update of this kind to your site in any case.  This couldn't harm BR's survival.<br><br><br>Link to my userlib...<br><br><a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=102259" target="_blank">http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=102259</a><br><br>If ever you think that this could be a feasable idea, please let me know, I'd be more than happy to work with you on this one.  In any case, as a loyal blitz user for many a year I hate to see things not going so well for monkey.  Hope things turn around for you.... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

About Ploppy: hire him please..<br><br>And: I'm an early adopter of the Amiga <b>BlitzBasic 2.1</b> too(purchased way way back, can see it standing proudly on my bookshelve from here). It filled a hole AmigaBasic just couldn't fill, when compared to the earlier Commodore BASIC on the C64. It brought back power to the user on the <b>Amiga</b>.<br><br>Just like that <b>Blitz3D</b> gave powerful and easy (3D)game programming power straight from the box to the <b>PC</b>, a feature that was very much missed there. (just purchased it rightnow to support the good cause)<br><br><b>Basic4Android</b> is now gaining lots of interest cos of the same reason and one can try out the (game)programming on the <b>Android</b> platform straight from the box there too.<br><br><br><br><b>IMHO people get hooked when they see how easy it is to code something interesting and powerful on the most popular platform(s)</b>, in this case for Android, a hot and booming platform(I know cos I purchased B4A too).<br><br>If BRL could do the same for <b>Monkey</b> I'd love to try it out(and I'm sure many others) and likely purchase it if has comparable powerful features (a big plus is the multi-platform ability ). <br>Rightnow the Monkey trial appears a bit useless if Android is your field of interest(cant try before buy). Of course HTML5 is also cool, but I think a potential huge market is being lost here by this limitation.<br><br><u><b>I would propose to install a 14 day trial limit to try Monkey on Android and iphone just to get people hooked.</b></u><br>Also a 3D engine would make a big hit out of it, cos most phones and tablets are perfectly capable of running 3D games(I have a few really good ones installed on my S3). They are the handheld consoles of the future I dare bet. PSP and NDS will be/are loosing ground rapidly. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I program several languages but I always come back to Blitz3D for quick projects, ...and larger ones. It is so incredibly easy accessable and it just works! I also believe that the majority of your fans appreciate this simple approach that Blitz3D provides. From first download to some cool stuff happening on the screen there's just minutes. That is unique. Many also go long way back and fancy procedural programming (I do) more than object-based (but keep types, they are great).

I have, like many others, been waiting many years for a follow up to Blitz3d and would have gladly gladly paid to have all that additional render power.  But it seems that this is not blr's goal.  If it is however somthing BLR would think about doing I'm sorry (and I do not wish to sound pretentious in any way, and I may regret saying this), but they may have missed the boat with a new flagship.  Unless blitz research comes up with something phenomenally groundbreaking there will be not much point in doing so.  It is taking me some time but I'm well on my way to making a dx9 and dx11 version of b3d with extra bits thrown into the bundle.  And once I get my hands on a 64-bit machine I'll release a 64-bit version of my dll too.  I am not the only one with a userlib on the way either.  Aqualung equally has a very good wrapper available too.  So I can't after all this help thinking that Mark really has missed out on an opportunity.  On the other hand, much respect goes to Mark for following his feelings on where to go with his projects.. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Blitz Research makes the BEST game making products for "skilled" developers. The Blitz tools are well worth the price. :D<br><br>I bought BlitzMax first, after "trying" the demo for 3 years. I was not disappointed in the least! I still use it today for every app I can think of. Mostly for platformer/shmup/FPS level editors and to grow my small indie game business.<br><br>Got Blitz3d a year later. Was not disappointed, even with the lack of flexbility BlitzMax had. It's still a great tool for 3D games on Windows desktops, because of its ease of use, heavy documentation and incredible power hidden underneath. Most people don't know how good they have it, when it comes to getting a 3D game up and running in 2 minutes from less than 6 lines of code anyone can read. And the limitations of the product aren't even apparent at the time! It's VERY flexible.<br><br>I don't think any product has balanced language flexibility, ease of deployment and graphical quality so well like what Blitz3d has, and no one probably will for the next 10 years. This is coming from someone who's tried nearly every 3D game making software on the market. Nothing beats Blitz3D. And the community's great too(very smart folks)! :)<br><br>I got Monkey as well, expecting it to work like past Blitz products, or at least be more stable. I hate to say it, but I was VERY disappointed with this product. :(<br><br>First of all, there's a lot of code "catches" that annoyed even myself, a veteran game programmer of 13+ years. It's very annoying having to run throughout the source, and patching up the product before you even deploy a game. That is, IF you can deploy it! I can only run HTML5 apps. No other targets, even when I've followed all directions, and set things up PERFECTLY! Really bums me out when I can deploy using FlashDevelop/VSC# 2010, but not deploy C#/Flash apps using Monkey on the same machine.<br><br>Monkey just has too many problems to be worth the $99 USD. At its current state, it's an alpha at best. Charging so much for alphas is not a good PR strategy.<br><br>If I'M annoyed at how terrible(IMHO) Monkey is, just imagine what someone less skilled than me is gonna say if they encounter all those issues! And then the customer support is downright awful? Yeah, they're not gonna be very happy at all.<br><br>Personally Mr. Sibly, I'd highly recommend you start small and iterate more, and focus on the [long-standing]community's wishes. Many of these guys have GREAT ideas! <i>You can make money from them!</i> <b>They're asking you to take their money!</b> I wish I had passionate customers like that. ^_^<br><br>You're right Mark, I would've bought bigger and better versions of BlitzMax/Blitz3D, and I'd STILL use the old products I bought! Because I'm a fan of Blitz Research.<br><br>I know you have your dreams, but I learned in university/life, that a good business needs guaranteed money-making strategies - exploiting your customers as much as they want. It doesn't need your dreams. The dreams can be used when you start making the BIG BUCKS! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Thanks for this, Mark. <br><br>I normally don't post anything in these groups. I generally just do my personal programming (in a variety of languages including Blitz) and keep silent, but this gift is superb and worthy of comment. Most of the programming I do is for personal scientific applications with fairly robust graphics for visualization (Fourier, Schrodinger, Relativity-Lorentz Transforms etc.). As such, most people would likely find anything I do excruciatingly boring and probably not be very interested in it (which is one reason I am not highly active in these groups).  I have not had time for games (at least right now). But I have found that code development with Blitz is very fast. It takes just a few lines of code to do what could take a couple of pages in C++. (Note, however, that I have never used Monkey).<br><br>So...for the future, I would love to see continued development of B+, Bmax and B3D so we can continue to use them as future OS's and graphics technologies emerge. I program almost exclusively in Windows, and worry that it won't be too long and maybe I will just have to rely on C++ (or C#) for development. <br><br>Anyway, whatever makes the business work is what must be done. It's just that I'd hate to see B+, Bmax and B3D fade away as OS's change.<br>I would be so happy to see continued support and enhancements of these products in the future.<br><br>In the mean time, my 99E+13 thanks to you Mark for these products and for releasing the source code to B+.  I wish you all the best and really appreciate what you have done for the programming world...whether it be games...or anything else! <br><br>T <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
