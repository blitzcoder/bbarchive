Also the "command help" bar was all in German.)<br><br>All added features that alter the way you input code from Blitz's native IDE should have an option to turn them off.<br><br>All I care about in an IDE is something simple enough as standard one, but with the added bonus of:<br>- Multiple undo commands<br>- Some kind of dropdown list, containing all Blitz commands or Fields of a Type, getting shorter as you type more letters. BlitzView had something like this, but it was all in German! And it would be nice to be able to have a dropdown bar for Fields of a Type too, when you type "\" (the equivalent of VB and C++'s ".")<br>- A Tool menu to perform tasks like tidying up code, auto-indenting the entire code (I can post a function to do this if you want), searching for undefined variables, etc etc<br><br>And if it's going to be a free IDE (coz I don't think anyone would get it if it wasn't) I'm sure there's no harm in including the source code (if written in B+) so that other programmers can not only learn from certain parts of code but also improve what you've already done. It would be nice to have it eventually "evolve" into a very functional IDE written by Blitz users, for Blitz users. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
