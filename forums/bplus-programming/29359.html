It's not enough to make a significant hit even on a crappy network, but I suppose this broadcast thing might slim things down even more by only having to send the packet once, although it may be better for me to leave the game as it is, so it keeps out of the way of other game servers on the LAN when running.

I suppose if there was an easy workaround for the firewall issues, it wouldn't really be much of a firewall, would it...<br><br>Man, I sure do alot of guessing and supposing.<br><br><br>[edit:] Oh, and in the event of checking for an ip like 192.168.x.x, you could change (255 AND BCASTIP(n)) to (65535 AND BCASTIP(n)).

Come to think of it, If nothing else: rather than counting up to 255, just count down from 255 - in most cases it will be an immediate match. On top of being more efficient, it would also make your code faster since there are less addresses to probe in most cases.<br><br>90%+ of the time you won't need to do your scan after all, it is only necesary to catch the exceptions.<br><br>you could even go as far as this, and probe the following IP's in order:<br><br>1) .255  (256 IP subnet)<br>2) .127  (128 IP subnet)<br>3) .63 and .191 (64 IP subnet)<br>4) .31, .95, .159, .223 (32 IP subnet)<br>5) .15, .47, .79, .111, .143, .175, .207, .239 (16 IP subnet)<br>6) .7, etc...

It makes far more sense to try the most common connections first and count down from 255 to the computer's ip. Although counting up from the computer's IP should mean that the probing remains within the designated netblock, in case probing outside of it sets any ultra-paranoid network admin alarm bells ringing, though this is probably a ridiculous precaution. If it doesn't determine the IP it will likely venture outside the block anyway, especially with a 65535 check. And if one's network was really that paranoid, network games would have a pretty hard time of it. The speed increase and likely reduction in traffic is probably worth the trade-off. I can always put in a feature in the 'advanced' options for the server allowing the user to specify the broadcast IP if so desired.

'With this small application , you can detect the IP's installed on your computer,
'including subnet mask , BroadcastAddr..
'
'I've wrote this because i've a programm that uses the winsock control, but,
'if you have multiple ip's installed on your pc , you could get by using the Listen
' method the wrong ip ...
'Because Winsock.Localip =&gt; detects the default ip installed on your PC ,
' and in most of the cases it could be the LAN (nic) not the WAN (nic)
'So then you have to use the Bind function ,to bind to your right ip..
'but how do you know &amp; find that ip ?
'you can find it now by this appl.. it check's in the api.. IP Table..
