If, in your case, what you say is true, you should be able to provide some form of proof i assume.. so, do that, that too doesn't hurt your business.. it makes no difference if you have to disclose a business address or a tax code, this stuff is readily available from a variety of sources around the world for those who really want to find it.<br><br><br>As i said, i wish you luck on your venture, and i mean that. Please, reconsider your decision to drop Blitz software completely, as there is a LOT of talent around these forums, and Blitz (Research) deserves any support it can get.. keep your business over e-mail, snail mail and your own forums but not public forums like these, there's always going to be people trying to shoot you down, for whatever reason they have, legitimate or not. Forums like these should be used for reqruitement purposes (Find the oppertunity, contact them, move the convo to other means than this forum) only, not business.<br><br>Tracer <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
