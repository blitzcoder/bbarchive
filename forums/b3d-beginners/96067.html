Task Manager is not a reliable way of measuring the actual memory use of an application, because it lists the maximum amount of memory allocated to it by the OS. The OS isn't going to start reclaiming tiny amounts of memory like that immediately, because the program will usually want them again, so it keeps the excess memory for the time being.<br><br>(At least I think that's what happens.)<br><br>By following andy_mc's suggestion, you'll be asking the slightly more reliable question of "does the OS allocate new memory for each new object, even though it should be able to use the space from the last one?".<br><br>As a couple of aside notes -<br><br>- If you run your program in windowed mode, you could have it on the screen next to the task manager - might be useful. If you want the program to stop when it's not in focus, use window mode 6 rather than 2.<br><br>- FreeTexture doesn't necessarily delete a texture.<br><br>Textures have a "reference count", which keeps track of how many things are using it: it starts at one, to represent the variable you loaded it into. When you apply the texture to an entity or brush, the reference count increases by one, and when you paint over it or free the entity/brush it was on, it decrements by one. You can also use FreeTexture <i>once</i> to decrement the refcount by one, which ensures that everything adds up. When the texture's reference count hits zero, the texture is deleted. This is why it's common to see code that loads a mesh, loads a texture, applies it and then frees the texture immediately: the texture will be perfectly safe as long as the mesh using it still exists, and it means one less thing to clean up later.<br><br>While there's absolutely nothing wrong with the way you're doing it, this piece of information may be of interest if you're trying to track memory.<br><br>I think (can't remember) that Blitz also caches textures in the background by filename, in case the same entities try to load more than one instance of the same texture - I could be wrong, but that actually seems like it might be an explanation for your odd memory use pattern. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But don't ever rely on this behaviour, because the memory allocator is free to do whatever it wants with space that it thinks isn't in use.<br><br>So in answer to this:<br><br><div class="quote"> Ok, so how do you track the memory use ? <br></div><br><br>You don't, unless you;re using a system that has some kind of runtime ability to manage memory use. The only figure you can get is how much the system has <i>made available</i> to the program; what the program does with that space is its own business. So that allocated space probably won't go down until something's sure that the program isn't still using it - and that it's worth bothering the program by messing with its space currently in use.<br><br>Anyway, you really don't need to go looking for memory leaks in the core command set. Even if they hadn't been in successful commercial use for the last ten years, Mark would have checked these things with the proper debug tools before releasing Blitz3D. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
