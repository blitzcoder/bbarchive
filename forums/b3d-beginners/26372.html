Select that item and a second menu appears with various ways of doing the same thing.<br><br>Any newbie or codewizard can copy/paste the program and visually test various concepts and see the results themself.  In turn, maybe somebody has yet another approach that is even faster and they add their findings to the program.<br><br>As we all now, when it comes to programming, there is more than one way to skin a cat.  <br><br><br>I believe the initial concept is a good idea and would answer many questions on optimization issues.<br><br>I also believe that the whole thing could get real messy real quick -OR- the whole thing may not get started at all.<br><br>Like I said, it is just a 'fun' little idea I have kicked around and now i have kicked it upon the forum here for others to kick around, stomp on, mutilate and thus tell me either I am a complete loon or that there is indeed some sort of merit.  <br><br><br>If interested, please respond to any of the following:<br><br>1) your views on the matter.<br><br>2) propose a mandatory outline of the program's specifications on how it should all come together / work<br><br>3) post some speed related questions <br><br>4) post some small code tidbits of things you come across<br><br>5) tell the good ol' doctor here that he really is a loon<br>and off with his silly nonsensical proposal.<br><br>6) anything under the sun.. thoughts anyone ?   <br><br><br><br>some examples at the top of my head:<br><br>...Blitz Arrays vs Dim Arrays vs Banks Vs ???...<br><br>...Gosubs Vs Functions Vs ???...<br><br>...Repeat_Until vs While_Wend vs For_Next vs ???...<br><br><br>Get the idea ?  Good!   Now remember, it doesn't really matter how well known the situation is, cause not everyone is up to date on the "well known" especially newbies.  We take a lot for granted sometimes on the basics.  Do you remember your first programs ?  How would you re-implement the same concepts if you knew then what you know now ?  Apply that thought to today.  <br><br><br>* In closing:<br><br>What it all boils down to ( and I hope against hope ) is a interactive-quasi-programming-gems-secrets-of-gurus-code-warrior-be-all-to-end-all-ever-evolving-hunk-of-programming-knowledge.   To some it would be educational, to others interesting and enlightning, and to yet to others a way to give back and help others.. for only 10 cents a day you can help a needy child... oops!  <br><br>Right, so flame, discuss, ignore... whatever. <br><br><br><br>-ddt! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Don't get me wrong, advancing technology and free market of pc computers is great, but in a small way sucks for the programmer.  In my sick twisted masochistic mind I sometimes long for the days of C64, where generally a commie was a commie was a commie.  &lt;grin&gt;    <br><br><br>&gt;What we need is a 'clever code TM (c) (R)' database, and &gt;possibly(in my case particularly, a 'Crappy code TM (c) <br>&gt;(R)' database.<br><br>Count me in on the Crappy code TM (c)  ;^)<br><br><br><br>Being that the test are subjective, the idea was kind of a see for yourself - your milliage may vary  kind of approach as oppossed to a This is the only way to go, buck-o.<br><br>True, each user will get different results, and in it's own way, this program could prove that.<br><br>Expanding on that, and I see this as another not to happen idea, one could report the times and give their set-up.<br><br>  Still, some things are faster, no matter what.

I am not sure that everyone on this forum understands that theory. If they dont, then they are going to have to learn it because this way of measuring an algorithms efficiency is standard throughout the industry.<br><br>I'll certainly contribute any way I can. It is easy to measure an algorithms speed but the overheads are different and who is going to decide which is the best?<br><br>It is certainly worth persuing because some of the code I have seen is horrible (including my own!). Also, some people here think that it is clever to have one long formula in a function to return a value rather than splitting it up. They dont realise that maths intensive stuff is time-consuming.  People also use the Bubble Sort algorithm because the code is short. They dont realise that it is probably one of the slowest sorting algorithms ever devised with an Order of magnitude of 'O'n squared!<br><br>So yes, anything to improve peoples programming skills gets my vote!<br><br>Regards <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
