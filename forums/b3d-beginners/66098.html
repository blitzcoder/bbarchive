While in the beginning the tech gap between my engine and the market leaders wasn't so obvious, it's now looking kind of like "last century". There is now a remarkable lack of features:<br><br>-support for proper shadows - including hardware-accellerated shadow volume creation.<br>(DevilsChild's engine may be the best solution right now, but still not industry speed)<br><br>-support for vertex shaders<br>-support for pixel shaders<br>-easy to use, stabile, fast built in physics<br><br>But it really takes a lot until you hit the limits of BLitz3D and DX7. It's not the way that you need shaders on day 2 of your engine project. Neverless, if you really plan to do a commercial fps game or so, it will be pretty chanceless without a minimum of standard gfx features. (DOF, Bloom, MOtion blur, BW/Green filters, etc. proper bumbmapping) and therefor a huge waste of 3d artwork.
