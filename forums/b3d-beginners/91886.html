They are complex tools and the have a steep learning curve to get into it. They also cost a lot. A professional 3d designer should have it.<br><br>When you're a bedroom industries inc. coder then you often work with models that were purchased. A simple level editor may take nomore than 5% of the total game work, unless you are GUI-Maniac.<br><br>In most cases it's a good idea to integrate the editor right in the game engine. But you should be careful not the create the engine too static, only to be able to edit everything during the game. <br>There may also be some speed problems when you try to do all the fx and editor handling at the same time (involves diffrent cameraranges, pickabilties, alpha-stuff, eg. helper-geometry that is invisible in game mode, but must be managable in editor mode). Am other example is the grass system that I added to my game project. In the game engine there are lots of animated quads, arrangend in grouns, alphasorted and so on. THis would take centuries to position all the grass. So I added a feature that allows to position a primiive, eg. a box at a place where grass should grow. I then label it "isgrass" and the engine will display it as grass, but hide the box completey. Switching this feature int he engine is not so easy since the grass system is using some sort of VIS optimation, has a fixed Quad contingent etc. Well this is just an example.<br><br>No matter if you integrate the editor and have to switch certain things when you go into editor mode, or if you use two apps, one an editor and the other one the game exe (where of course at some point in time the one was a simple copy of the other one) that will force you to update the editor from time to time, actually, whenever there's something new in the engine that should be displayed, in the end of the day it will be some work to do.<br><br>Oh, and PS, for enemies I even have a third editor :). It allows the player to walk around in the level and records his way (waypoint list). In the engine an enemy will then patrol along this way. I am using a small game window (640*480) to get a steady, high framerate for a better recording quality (smooth turns etc.).<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2010</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Then the game simply reads this file and places objects throughout the level based on that data. I'm sure I could have written this script just as easily for 3ds max too. Does XSI have script support?<br><br>This was easy cheesy. For a more in-depth game I'd want to do something more seamless like they are describing, where I can switch between playing the level and editing it, but for my needs it was much more efficient to simply bust out a quick XML dumping script for Maya. Took me maybe an hour to write the script, and that includes the time spent learning the Maya API calls I needed to use.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2010</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
