I was hoping I could get a comment or two from those who have gone before me.  I've seen plenty of 3D editors, level designers, ect ect, but how do indies create decent sounds for thier games?  What kind of skills/training would it take?  Can an indie produce a good quality game or stuck making alot of mediocure stuff just to make money?  Thanks for any comments. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Don't count on it. If you want to sell something, you do not only need to be a good artist, but also a superb salesman and marketing specialist.<br><br>Games Design is divided into highly specialized Jobs these days, like Character Design, Landscape design, Map Design, Texture Design, Sounds Design, Music, Engine Design (with lots of diffrent programming specialist).<br><br>Even if you want to learn only one of these skills, take it seriouly, this will take a long time to gain professional quality. Probably many years. If you are very good, you may learn e. Character Design in a few months.<br><br>But even when you are good in one of those special areas, it doesn't mean that you'll automatily find a job in the business or that you will sell your own stuff.<br><br>It's a very hard job, and when you're an indie, you even need to sell things in the same time. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There are plenty of artists and sound guys out there that you could hire. If you code something and it looks promising, and looks like your really going somewhere, people might join you, for a share of whatever is sold. Me and my friend, we are hiring folks to help out. About what sort of skills you would need. I'd would guess alot of peoples skills are self taught. I know my programming is self taught.<br><br>You should go on IRC and ask about if you need any assistance.
