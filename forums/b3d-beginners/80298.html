I want it to:<br><br>1. Not show the file menu for one frame when you let go of quit. I want it to go straight from blue to black, not from blue to gray to black like it's doing now.<br><br>2. Actually quit. I've tried everything I can think of, but I can't seem to make releasing a mouse button do something. I've deactivated the code that didn't work.<br><br>I would also like to know how to make the cursor start at the center of the screen or anywhere else I want it to, but that's secondary. The code for the menu starts at the label .filemenuevents<br><br>Thanks, hope someone here can help. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I can't make it look or act any closer other than the two problems I mentioned.<br><br>Thanks for trying though. I was pretty burnt out from working on it so much, so an outsider's perspective was helpful. I didn't even notice those two lines were so similar because I was juggling so much at once. By the way, your mouse idea worked perfectly.<br><br>I was thinking, would breaking things up into functions help at all, or would that just complicate things too much? It seems like maybe the gray frame problem, and the whole not quitting problem might be caused by there being too many things in one part of the program that could contradict each other. That's not to say I have any idea how to write functions that would fix the problem, but I am at present accepting suggestions/helpful code snippets/the whole thing revamped...or whatever. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
