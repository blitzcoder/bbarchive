My program creates a random city map, a 64x64 grid, each block on the grid is either assigned to be a road segment or building. The system is working pretty well and produces some nice random cities, the problem is, there are too many buildings and i would like to place the buildings only around the perimeter of the roads. At present the buildings all have the same footprint size but im working on a random building generator that will create random building sizes, shapes and footprint sizes. I want to be able to generate a percentage of big, medium and small buildings and to scatter them around the map, but only place them at the road side. Hope this makes sense. If anyone has any ideas, let me know.<br><br>Sorry forgot to mention, the map is stored in an array, with verticle roads, horizontal roads, crossroads, building etc all having a code.<br><br>Thanks. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I have not done it yet but i think it could work.<br><br>Concerning the procedural modeling of a building, i think that the more sensible approach is to know which possible parts to use and in which place depending on the building kind, and add the parts as if it was builders who were creating the structure. For example, pick randomly a part in a group of parts depending on the kind of the building. (residence, industry, shop, administration, school, etc...)<br><br>It does not answer your question but it can give you some ideas about the subject. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

All roads are the same width and at present all building footprints are square, but that is something that will definitely change.<br><br>@ EdzUp[GD] ive read up a bit on box sorting, and it does look ideal for this situation, unfortunately im nowhere near the level of programmer required to code and implement this, but ill look at it again, it might be easier than i think.<br><br>Heres a few screenshots of what i have so far -<br><br>Random roads<br><img src="http://www.alpha-surveys.co.uk/RandomCity/Image1.jpg"><br><br>Whole city<br><img src="http://www.alpha-surveys.co.uk/RandomCity/Image2.jpg"><br><br>Underpass<br><img src="http://www.alpha-surveys.co.uk/RandomCity/Image4.jpg"><br><br>Underpass<br><img src="http://www.alpha-surveys.co.uk/RandomCity/sc3.jpg"><br><br>Street Level<br><img src="http://www.alpha-surveys.co.uk/RandomCity/Image3.jpg"><br><br>Street Level<br><img src="http://www.alpha-surveys.co.uk/RandomCity/sc1.jpg"><br><br>Roof Level<br><img src="http://www.alpha-surveys.co.uk/RandomCity/Image5.jpg"><br><br>The buildings are just placeholders for now until i code the procedural building code, but i would really like to get the placement sorted before i do that.<br><br>Thanks again guys. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

These would be either four points or two points and a width/height or perhaps just two points at opposite corners (since all these areas will be rectangular)<br>Once you have these regions defined (or per region as you go) - then you can place buildings along each of the four sides something like:<br><pre class=code>

  If (BZ);No zero-sized buildings!
   PlaceBuilding(X-BX,Z,BX,BZ)
  End If
  Z=Z+BZ ; Make sure next building placed correctly
Next

;Next, the North/Upper Edge
For X=START_X To END_X
 Z=START_Z
 BX=Rand(1,4);Random range of Building sizeX
 BZ=Rand(1,4);Random range of Building sizeZ
  If (X+BX&gt;END_X)

  End If

  If (BX);No zero-sized buildings!
   PlaceBuilding(X,Z,BX,BZ)
  End If
  X=X+BX ; Make sure next building placed correctly
Next

;Finally, the South/Lower Edge
For X=START_X To END_X
 Z=START_Z
 BX=Rand(1,4);Random range of Building sizeX
 BZ=Rand(1,4);Random range of Building sizeZ
  If (X+BX&gt;END_X)

   PlaceBuilding(X,Z-BZ,BX,BZ)
  End If

Next
End Function

Function PlaceBuilding(X,Z,BX,BZ)

End Function

</pre><br><br>One potential problem I can forsee already with this method, though, is that each the corners will be processed twice (once whern doing the horiz then when doing the vertical), This might be alleviated if you make START and END smaller in magnitude by 'nX * nZ', and then place buildigns of nX * nZ at each corner etc.<br>Hope that all makes sense. If I get time, and if you need it, I'll try and get something more concrete for you. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
