As stated in the title, I'm having problems with types. Darn types, they're hard to get a hang of (for me, anyways)... D:<br><br>In this case, I'm making enemies to shoot.<br><br>To spawn them, I'm using the whole "EnemyPointer.Enemy = New Enemy" deal-io. The enemy type has an entity field that holds the model for the enemy. In order to be able to retrieve the type instance that the entity's associated with, I'm using EntityName() and Handle(EnemyPointer).<br><br>As for shooting them, I'm using CameraPick(). In order to detect if it's of the enemy type, I'm using the code found in the last post made by Stevie G in <a href="/posts.php?topic=104140" target="_blank">this topic</a>. If it is, then I make it set one of the type instances "IsAlive" variables to false.<br><br>Once this variable is false, the update enemies function takes care of the rest. It rolls the entity around until it's flat with the ground - Roll# = 90. Then, it frees the entity from the program.<br><br>Well, that's how my game currently is, and I'm having problems with it. The thing is, I spawn in a few enemies, and everything's good. I shoot one, and everything still good. It does it's little rotation thingy and all like it's supposed to. Well, three spawns later, I spawn in  another enemy, and this one turns out weird. The enemy spawns spinning, and it won't stop. Even if it "hits the floor" (if Roll# = 90), it still continues to spin. It shouldn't spin, as it hasn't been shot yet, which means "IsAlive" should be true, which means that it shouldn't go through the "if" statement to get to the rotate command. If the enemy is shot, then it sets it's roll back to 0 and replays the whole thing until it reaches 90 degrees, and then it frees the entity. The next spawn is normal, and so are all the other ones, until that designated 4th spawn pops up.<br><br>If I spawn multiple enemies, and shoot the last two spawned, then every 3rd and 4th spawn become unlucky, and so on.<br><br>This is strange (duh), and I think it *might* have something to do with the handling of the pointer index. However, I'm not too sure.<br>Help, anyone??<br><br>Oh, and hopefully this post is easy to understand. I'm not too sure that it is right now... :/<br>^_^ <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Basically create as many instances of the enemy as you'll ever need. When something dies, just hide the entity and set the isalive flag to false.  When you spawn a new enemy, instead of creating a new type instance, iterate through the types and find the first one which isn't alive and use that instead.

Assuming roll starts at 0 and increases in steps of size 1 you would think it eventually hits 85. But that may not be true. It may actually get to something like 85.0001 or 84.99999 and the "=85" test will fail.<br><br>So you might test If EnemyPointer\Roll# &gt;= 84.5 ...<br><br>Blitz3D unfortunately doesn't have any way to format output for floats. It always rounds the display to six digits. It does the same when converting to a string. This "beautifies" the output, but is misleading. It would display 0.999999999 as 1.0, which may well be what you would rather see. But it makes debugging rather difficult.<br><br>Here's an example of small errors and confusing displayed values. x always appears to be 1.0 when it is occasionally 0.99999994, which you could see if enough digits were displayed. Also notice that there are only 8 failures in 100 tests. That's another reason this sort of thing is so baffling.
