We'd probably have kept playing except that game is aimed at PvP while we're strictly PvE types.<br><br>What would people recommend as good and (fairly) current tools to accomplish this? I've already stumbled across treeparty (WOW!) and tried out TED again (bought it waaay back) and was quite impressed with V6. While I'm searching around and trying demos it'd be great to get some tips on good things to look at.<br><br>I remember my biggest stumbling block being 3D character models with suitable animations. Psionic was making some good demo models (dwarf or something?) but I was poor back then and couldn't commission a set. Are there any "packs" of 3D characters (all human would be fine but it'd be nice to get some dwarves and elves in there too).<br><br>The second biggest problem was figuring out how to handle the world map in a client-server model. I'm happy using "zones" but couldn't see how to use multiple terrain objects in the server. I'd also be happy to use some form of continuous world map but couldn't figure out how handle that either. I'm hoping maybe someone has designed a system or created a tutorial on how to use more than one terrain object or how to do multiple zones kind of thing. TED does multi-maps but I haven't the foggiest idea how to utilize them.<br><br>I also don't need "free" stuff only and would be happy to purchase things as long as they aren't crap (the tools for RealmCrafter, like "megaterrains" come to mind - total waste of money even if they were a pittance).<br><br>Network code I did pretty well with though "efficient" wouldn't apply to what I had cobbled together.  I see a few feature rich network examples kicking around now that look pretty good.<br><br>Anyway, lets hear what you folks think would be good things to use! I should say though that simplicity is more important to me than feature count.<br><br>Thanks! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
