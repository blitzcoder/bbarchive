In my game, there is double jumping. I set up a flag where when the player is touching the map, jumping = 1. When jumping = 1, he can jump. Whenever he is not touching the map, jumping = 0, so he can't jump. <br><br>While in the air, pressing the key to jump makes jumping = 2, so he can jump again. When jumping = 2, he absolutly cannot jump anymore until he touches the map.<br><br>Now for the problem. <br><br>I used entitycollided to determine when the player lands on the floor so he can jump again. The problem is that when the player is colliding with ANYTHING on the map, walls, buildings etc, he can jump again, so there is now limit to how much you can jump, even when touching a wall.<br><br>Is there anyway to determine whether the player is touching the floor or touching the wall in a map? I'm honestly stumped. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If possible, use a different EntityType on walls than you use on the floor. This would require separate meshes for each type, so this may not be an option.<br><br>2. Create a pivot at the players feet. Then create another pivot and place it directly at the point of the player/level intersection using CollisionX(), CollisionY(), and CollisionZ(). Last, perform an EntityDistance check between the two pivots. If they are close together, then you know that the player's "feet" are touching the ground, but if they are not close, then you know that it's the player's chest or head or somewhere other than the feet colliding. You can use this check to disable infinite jumping like you described above.<br><br>I was going to provide some sample code, but I don't have access to it right now, and I'm not thinking clearly enough to re-write it. Let me know if a sample would be helpful. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Also, I have another idea, but i'm not sure if I can use it. <br><br>You could use the findchild command to pick out peices of the map, let's say the floor, and create an entitytype for it. It sounds like it would make sense, but i'm still kinda weary on it. <br><br>I'm actually pretty interested in your idea, since you can do other things with the pivots, such as allow the player to jump on enemie heads to kill them. <br><br>If you could be generous enough, maybe you can try to re-write the example so I can get the idea better. I'm still very confused with collision functions. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
