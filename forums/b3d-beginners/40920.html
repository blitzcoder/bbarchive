I suspect the problem is due to the fact that the polygons are very, very large in size (the mesh is about 20,000 'metres' wide) as the artifacting seems to decrease in proportion with the polygon size (i.e. it doesn't occur with much smaller meshes). Is this a limitation of blitz3d (or directx itself?).<br><br>EDIT - Or my engine? :} <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
