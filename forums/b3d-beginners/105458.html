Does that mean Blitz3d games would work too? I don't even have a regular cellphone, or I'd test it myself. If they do work, what happens when the horizontal viewing mode is activated? Assuming it rotates correctly, should Graphics3d be setup in expectation of it being played that way, since as far as I know there's no command for detecting the change? I'm pretty sure there's no commands for touchscreen controls either, so you'd need a smartphone with a tactile keyboard. How many smartphone users have those now, and Windows 10 for that matter? I know that's a lot of questions, but it's just to consolidate threads. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Well, my immediate reaction to smartphones has always been to not touch any device that doesn't have a keyboard. Even with one, the layout of the menus and stuff has always really bugged me. But most people seem to be fine with them, so I always just figured they'd never change. Yet now here we are, more and more of them have keyboards, and as your link shows, there's a clear effort to make more and more of them be able to run the same Windows as a tower or laptop. Maybe soon they all will, and if that happens, smartphones will basically be like netbooks that fit in your pocket. Then even I, who have always loathed smartphones, would probably buy one. You know, just to test out my Blitz3d programs ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Re: 3D - there are libraries, such as JPCT-AE which is quite blitzlike in some ways (for a java library). Probably the biggest hurdle for someone who is used to blitz like languages is the whole idea of a 'project' rather than a single source file where a host of source-like files are used to compile the game - but IDEs like Eclipse do make it fairly easy.  The difficulty, as with anything, is the initial learning phase that you have to go through. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

From what I can tell, Windows phones are being abandoned, phones that run the dumbed down version of Windows 10 are not well liked, and so the people reported about at the link are trying to make it so more phones will be able to run the real version of Windows 10. Also, the Directx thing was I think concluded at <a href="/posts.php?topic=104902" target="_blank">http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=104902</a>. You have to deal with a Directplay install query, but it works. So hopefully if they're able to get the real Windows 10 working on more phones, Blitz3d will work on them too. I say hopefully, because if in a couple years everyone's got Windows with a slideout keyboard in their pocket, that's basically a Gameboy in my eyes, so I'll try to make sure my game works on it.<br><br><img src="http://gamesandphones.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Samsung-Transform-Ultra.jpg"> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
