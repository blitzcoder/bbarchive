I do not know if this is the appropiate place for this kind of question or if I should be asking it at all, but here goes: those of you who have made games in Blitz3D and make money from them, is it a profittable market?  About how much money do you make anually (if it can be known)?  How long would it take say, a two person team, to make a good game?  The reason I ask is because I have been using Blitz for a few months now and would like to make a serious game (so far the only playable thing I've done is a ship followed around by some enemies, and even that is not quite finished).<br><br>    I realize that  making a good game requires time (lots of it!), effort and commitment, but well, I'd just like to know, how do the other Blitzers do it?  How long does it take them to create all those cool games?  How many people does it take?  And how lucrative is it? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I certainly think that Blitz is capable of producing games that are the same or better quality than say a PS2... But it is going to struggle to keep up with something like Halflife2 or Doom3, which are setting the standard for todays games quality. (Blitzers please dont lynch me! :) ). I know this is only down to the quality of the coder at the wheel, but the reality is that if you can make something look and play as well as one of these games, then chances are you are already working for someone doing the same thing... and of course assembling a team of unpaid workers is no easy task...  Keeping unpaid people motivated is a nightmare, the enthusiasm has to be natural and they have to want to succeed at the project. What normally causes failure (in my experience) on these projects is a lack of vision and above all, commitment.  <br><br>That said, it's my belief that there is a secondary gaming industry out there! It caters for the (what I would call) NON-GAMERS - Places like YAHOO games these days offer tons of small games at a decent price... The games are relatively simple, good looking and highly playable, aimed at people like my Mum.  Just check out Yahoo Games to see the well 'challengable' competition.  This I would say is the best market to tackle on your own. <br><br>The only thing you need is a good idea and maybe a strong dose of determination.  But I am sure that most feel the same as me on this - it is ultimately the IDEA in your game that is the major challenge. <br><br>I hate one aspect of the industry today - 'genre' - this is a maddening phrase because it is segrigation, which people adhere to everyday and loosely use as a basis for their gaming choice. e.g. 'Oh no, not another 1st person shootem up, I dont want to play that"  It's really no different from music or movies in this respect.  Most people are narrowminded in the sense that they will not play certain games because of what they are... This is sad and it never used to be like this.  Once upon a time, people would buy a game because of the 'idea' behind it - not based upon the GUI it uses.  Think of something that no one has thought of - make a basic version showing the concept in Blitz, write up all the rest in a word document, burn a CD, print a document - MAIL IT TO YOURSELF AND NEVER OPEN IT (a cheap way to prove copyright) and send another off to big companies with a nice letter and telling them all about yourself and how you would like to offer them your project. :) <br><br>That's my two pence worth! :) Hope you find it useful. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Both these games use technology that the PS2 simply isn't capable of delivering. Graphically they shine as examples of some of the most realistic products produced to date.  The playability, interaction/userbility with these games is quite astonishing in comparison to what your average PS2 game can offer... Massive multiplayer games over the internet with stunning visual effects, team play, deathmatch, capture the flag, multiple screen resoloutions, colour depths, detail levels, alter control keys, run modificaitons, write modifications, include new weapons, new characters, new worlds, include new dialogue, include new sound fx, write scripts to control AI - scripts to control how the hardware in your PC draws to a texture! etc, etc - oh don't forget the availablility of the game editors which is a whole other program to support these games.  So yes I think a PS2 will hvae trouble 'keeping up with this' - Only an idiot would assume that Doom3 and HL2 are better than any game on the PS2. <br><br>People like different things - I happen to think that my PC offers me the very best in gaming technology. If i wanted an average 3 - 5 hours of game time and no real community support or ability to modify a game, I'd just play console games all the time.  As it happens though, I sometimes play games on all my consoles, my CUBE, my XBOX, and yes sometimes I load up something on the PS2, but to date, I have yet to see a game on any of these formats that is able to keep up with the two games i mentioned.  Though I can say that I enjoyed ZELDA Windwaker more than I did Doom3, whether its a BETTER game or not, thats a tough call to make. <br><br>However, I am not dumb enough to think that just because a game pushes the latest technology to its limits doesn't necesarrily make it a 'better' game.  I have tons of respect for console coders because they have their hands tied - they have incredibly tight deadlines and are limited in what they can do, this kind of desigining demands that as designers they have to think "inside the box" not outside.  Who'd have thought that Quake2 would have ever run on a PS1?  When it requires over 20megs of RAM just to start on a PC, and yet someone took that game and got it to run on a 2meg playstation.  Obviously the game is not the same experience, but you have to acknowledge what wonders can be done, given the time and dedication...<br><br>GFK mentions marketing - yes of course your game will need that, but you don't want to be worrying about that.  If you have a good idea and can demonstrate it with the aid of a CD and document (you'd be mad to send no documentation) and someone wants to buy it, are you really going to care about marketing when you are sat at home looking at your online bank account with a five figure sum in there, for the last six months work. Leave that to the capitlists and do what you love to do - write games :D  Do NOT let people on forums ruin your dreams.  It is possible!! If you want it badly enough, you can have it.  This industry is just like many others - it's a numbers game - solicit enough professionals in the industry, target them and build relationships and you will sell yourself and hopefully your project. Yes, it's all time and effort, but well worth it if it gets you what you want, right?!<br><br>When all is said and done - the point I originally tried to make was, yes you can make money, but don't try and make Doom4 or Halflife3, cus it aint gonna happen - be realistic, try and be original, and you have as much chance as the next guy to write a sellable product using blitz. Go for it!!  <br><br>Again, I hope you find it useful.  <br><br>GFK, 5 or 6 out of 23 or so sentences is not a majority - unless of course you are a Tory politician.  Those kind of majorities are what enforced things like the criminal justice act in the UK, and sadly has gotten many of our soldiers killed in Iraq...

It's nice to be able to see the views of others in this particular topic.  I can have my personal opinion on this matter, but to be truly objective, I need to know what other people think (which was the intention of my initial post).  Some of you think it can be done if you want it badly enough and some think it can't be done unless I spend thousands in PR and marketing.  <br><br>  I have to say, I have to agree with both.  If I don't want it badly enough it ain't gonna happen.  But that also means I must be willing to spend all that money.  <br><br>  I currently have no intention of making games for a living, though I would love to make some money from it (that's why I am investigating what can be expected) and I don't have the money to hire artists or specialists in PR.  Nor do I have friends who would be willing enough to help me make a game and go unpaid.  The point: I realize I don't have the resources to make the next Doom of Half Life.  So I guess if I'm to make money from games, I can't really expect much.  I'm better off taking whatever money I earn and buying a big screen TV like Rob suggested :)  Still I thank all those who took the time to let me know their opinions and experiences.<br><br><br>  As for this not being the place to discuss this type of thing, I realize it isn't.
