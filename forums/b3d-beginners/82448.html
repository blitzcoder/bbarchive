Otherwise, the colour map will be used as an alpha map. With alpha maps, the dark areas always equal high-transparency, light areas equal low-transparency."<br><br>But I was under the impression that the only options available were binary alpha (only black gets turned transparent), and color map used as an alpha map (any color that's even slightly dark gets turned practically transparent). What's this about "if an image contains an alpha map"? I like using pngs just because they're as small as jpgs and have bmp quality, but can they really "contain" an alpha map? If so, how can I get Photoshop to merge the two? Or do I need some other program? Thanks and hope someone can help! :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I wish someone had posted quick info for me, like i'm about to:<br><br>   In photoshop, go to the Channels tab, then click on Create New Channel. A new channel will appear on the list, called "Alpha 1" (at least it's what its called on my old version 5.0). In that channel, everything thats 100% white will be completely opaque, everything lesser than that will be gradually transparent. When you're going to save your PNG from photoshop, make sure you only have <b>a single alpha channel</b> (meaning, no "Alpha 2" or "Alpha 3"), as that's the only amount photoshop will export, be it .TGA or .PNG. After you make sure you only have 1 alpha channel, then you can export your PNG or TGA (both formats are accepted by blitz3D and can have alpha transparency channel). In the export dialogue (which I believe to be Save a Copy as...), make sure that Exclude Alpha Channel checkbox is unmarked (or else it will...exclude the alpha channel and undo all your hard work. Makes sense).<br><br>Then that's it. All you have to do is load in blitz3D with the flag 2, and it'll read transparency from the texture's alpha channel. That way you can control parts you want to show or not. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Just don't even read it. Click okay.<br>6. now go to File&gt;Save as and call it imagenameWITHALPHAMAP.png<br>7. definitely taunt, and possibly insult the integrity of the error message that comes up then. Don't worry, it worked! Click okay.<br>8. load the image into Blitz3D with flag 2, and you now have perfect texture antialiasing!<br><br>By the way, for mesh antialiasing get this: <a href="http://h1.ripway.com/fox95871/index.html" target="_blank">http://h1.ripway.com/fox95871/index.html</a><br><br>One more thing: I noticed Blitz3D crashes if you use ClearTextureFilters in a game that has a flag 2 object.

If you save this, it's going to work in Blitz. It's not exactly the same as the 4th channel, but you can use the selection tools to erase something on RGB based on an the greyscales of an other image. Or maybe the blendmodes can be used.<br><br>As other people suggested - use the dds format. Whenever possible try to use masks instead of alpha, because of the z-order issue. Masked dds are really nice, but it'S a bit tricky to get a matte color that looks good (actually: you need a clone layer of the image (under the original layer), opacy 2%, then blur it one time, this way directx will use the correct colors on the outline of the mask, otherwise not.)

Not sure why it works though. Flag 1 is color, and 2 is alphamap. So if ClearTextureFilters was saying "No flags at all" and LoadTexture was saying "Alphamaps only", and now it's saying "Alphamaps and color" why would that be making it work? Why would not having color on have been making it crash before? :/<br><br>Anyway, thanks for figuring it out for me overall if not the whys :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Maybe the alpha data is extracted from the color layer, and there is no internal check to see if there is any color information available ? Maybe ClearTextureFilters was added in a later stadium of Blitz3D than loading the alpha layer, and the routine that loads the alphamap was never made compatible with textures that don't have color information? I can only guess.<br>Anyway, I think you could add something like:<br>TextureFilter "", 1<br>after using ClearTextureFilters. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
