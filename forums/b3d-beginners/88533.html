There is no code structure that needs the Goto or Gosub commands; If/For/While etc. and functions are quite adequate and a lot more elegant and readable, so it looks like you can safely stick to what you would have been using already with VB.<br><br>Global variables are also unnecessary to express any given program, although in some cases they might be a simpler way of accessing objects. What I'd suggest is trying as far as possible to pass all necessary information to a function in its parameters; only add Globals for things that really are supposed to be visible to and dominate the entire program. Otherwise it's hard to see what information is being made available to a given function and to get an idea of what is going on.<br><br>Finally... Blitz3D makes graphics easy! You don't need to start with non-graphical apps unless that's what you actually want to be working on - 3D applications are really no more difficult and (in my opinion) far more rewarding to work on as you can visually check on your progress as you go along. If you've already got some basic BASIC experience, you'll probably learn best by just diving straight in.<br><br>Good luck! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you can imagine all possible locations of a block, as a visualisation of the array itself.<br><br><pre class=code>
Global BlockAreaWidth = 16
Global BlockAreaHeight = 30
Dim BlockArea(BlockAreaWidth,BlockAreaHeight) ; arrays are global as standard. Oh and the ; character means anything after on the same line will be ignored as it is a comment.
</pre><br><br>That would give you a container, so to speak, to place your blocks in. Every time you want to redraw the screen, you simply loop through the array, and draw a block, at the correct location.<br><br>So, you would need a few things to start off with. Firstly, you need to know how wide the image your using as a block is. From this, you can work out the spacing between each block:<br><br><pre class=code>
Global BlockImage = LoadImage("Block.png")
Global BlockSize = ImageWidth(BlockImage)
</pre><br><br>Ok, so what that does, is load an image using the LoadImage() command. You simply supply the filename, of the image you want to load. Here, i have used a local filepath, so the image is located in the same directory as the code running it. The Global command sets the variable up, so it can be accessed/usuable anywhere in the code. When ever you want to use that image, you simply provide the variable name BlockImage.<br><br>Now, you set up a global variable to hold the size of the image. Because tetris generally uses square images, the image you provided should be square. That being the case, the width will also be the height. Makes things a little easier as you don't need to concern yourself with two different dimension sizes.<br><br>Now, you need a start drawing co-ord for your play area:<br><br><pre class=code>
Global StartDrawX = 100
Global StartDrawY = 100
</pre><br><br>Now, when drawing you arrays contents, you have everything you need:<br><br><pre class=code>
For X = 0 to BlockAreaWidth
   For Y = 0 to BlockAreaHeight
      If BlockArea(X,Y) = 1 then
         DrawImage BlockImage, StartDrawX + (X * BlockSize), StartDrawY + (Y * BlockSize)
      End If
   Next
Next
</pre><br><br>Sorry to patronise you here, if you know all this stuff ^_^. The above will set up two loops inside each other. Firsty it will loop through the Y columns, moving onto a column after each loop.<br><br>It then checks the array value, to see if it holds a 1. If so, then it will draw a block at that location.<br><br>Now, the positioning works fairly easily. It takes the starting draw location, and adds on (the current value of X) TIMES (the value of the blocksize), and the same with the Y co-ord.<br><br>This draws out the play area. the good thing here is, any changes made to the array elsewhere, are instantly drawn to the screen the next time the draw is called. So, tetris, in this instant, is all about putting values into an array, and deleting them if no block exists.<br><br>The way i'm working it here, is any array slot with a 1 in it, will have a block drawn in it. Any other value (i'd put a zero in for simplicity) will cause no block to be drawn. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
