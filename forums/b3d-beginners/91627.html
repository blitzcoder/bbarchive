Right now I've set up a collision between the player and the ladder so that while the player is moving forward and colliding with the ladder, they move upwards.<br><br>I've basically made a variable "Climb_on" that becomes true when the player is colliding with the ladder, and becomes false when the player is not colliding with the ladder. The player moves upwards when this switch is on and the player is moving forward. However this has lead to a problem,<br><br>If the player stops moving mid-climb, "climb_on" becomes false (as the player is no longer 'colliding') and so the player falls.<br><br>What is intended is that the player "sticks" to the ladder/climbing wall. How would I go about doing this? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This way, the player should always be in contact with part of the ladder<br><br>Actually now Ive just said all that, it's clear that it's certainly easier said than done, but of course, most FPS type games seem to handle ladder-climbing with little diffioculty so presumably there is a fairly straightforward way to go about it.<br>Personally, I'm still in favour (honestly not egotistically) with the first option, since the condition of the 'switch' can be used to do all sorts of other stuff too, such as, making aiming harder for example. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If they stray outside of the quad they come out of ladder climbing mode and into fall mode.<br><br>The quad was part of a type that also held a field stating the height of the ladder so the progeam would know when the player has reached the top. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

When I touch the ladder, climbing mode becomes true. This disables X and Z movements meaning the player can only travel up and down the ladder, and to prevent the falling I reduced the gravity to zero temporarily. Another key is pressed to be released from the ladder and return gravity to normal. <br><br>Now the only thing left is getting off at the top of the ladder. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If the character, or the camera, or whatever it is that you're using for the player gets within a certain distance of those pivots, you can position the player over time away from the ladder like they were climbing off and disable any variables which would hold the character to the ladder, as well as turn the gravity variable back to normal.<br><br>I'm sure there's a better way to do it, but it seems to work well enough for my game. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
