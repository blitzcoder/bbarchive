Both use a form of basic, just use a little different syntax. <br><br>I prefer Blitz syntax, cause it has more 'system' and DB-pro seems too simplified to make sense. Just my humble opinion but I'm attracted to some of the features of DB-pro, yet I believe, that the basic features in both programs, are more stable and flexible in Blitz.<br><br>I'm glad I started with Blitz but I might buy DB-pro, though just out of curiosity.
