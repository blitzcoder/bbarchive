The clue really is in the name... if you "include" files a.bb, b.bb and c.bb then your exe will include all of their contents. You can flit between their sections of code, of course, but there would be no loading after the fact... they're already there.<br><br>Level loading should typically involve you sitting down and formalising exactly what it is your core game code will have to deal with and how the data for each level will be expressed, then formulating a loading routine to generate the world from the data for the engine (and, if you're sensible, a level editor and matching save routine).

First of all, your game need to be capabl of releasing everything from memory that was part of a level. THe easiest way would be to use a textfile that holds all information it needs to load a level: MEsh filenames, Positions, Rotations, Scalings, 3Dsound Filenames, positions etc. (assuming you want to make a 3D game),  You engine would then read the textfile and load, position, rotate and scale the level content one by one. In the same time it will store all entity handles in an array or as types, so you will be able to free them at the end of the level using a single for loop that will release all stuff and make space for the next level. Then you only have to reset all global game variables to their intial value and then you can load the next level, using the same loading function like with level one. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

For actual level geometry you'd normally use a dedicated modeller and save out either a .x or .b3d file (and your data file would refer to each component model and describe how they fit together and are populated). But as each and every game is different - yes, you basically have to devise a custom system that fits your needs. It's quite a leap to go from typing out your levels long-hand (ie entity by entity) to formulating a system that will build them from data... it takes forward thinking because your core code has to be flexible and your loader extensible.<br><br><div class="quote"> <br>is there a more simple way of transfering your levels into that data string?<br> <br></div> <br>When you're experimenting it's probably quickest to write the data by hand (if nothing else it reduces the chance of bugs); once you're commited to a sufficiently large project it's then more likely that knuckling down and writing a level editor and save routine will be worthwhile.<br><br>The biggest question to be asking yourself is "Do I actually need a level loader?" If your game is only modestly sized then it may be much more expedient to simply "hard-code" everything into the main source code. Just remember that the "right" way is the way that enables you to get the job done.<br><br>If you take nothing else from this thread, though, understand that a Blitz exe can't interpret and run .bb files... it would be like expecting your Word Processor to understand C++ just because that's the language it was written in. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But I suggest to do it this way:<br><br>Make your Level Editor capable of displaying a File Request Box. So you can choose a Mesh file. After chosing a meshfile, the Editor will load this meshfile right away. You will then be able (well you have to code this, it's the editors functionality) to select the Mesh, rotate it, scale it, position it in 3D.<br>The editor should store all information about the Meshes you used to load in an array, or in a type structure. Most people will tell you to use types, but personally I prefere an Array. It doesn't really matter.<br><br>Basicly you first need to sit down and think about what parameters for every mesh you want to be able to set in the editor. This means you are "wrapping" the entity. Make a list like:<br><br>filename (includes path)<br>name (a string you can use to give it a name)<br>x#<br>y#<br>z#<br>xscale#<br>yscale#<br>zscale#<br>pitch#<br>yaw#<br>roll#<br>alpha#<br>pickmode<br>collision type<br>optional texture<br>texture flag<br>optional texture 2<br>texture flag<br>optional texture 3<br>texture flag<br>optional texture 4<br>texture flag<br>EntityFX<br><br><br>and maybe a lot more. you need to take some time to make a list that contains everything that could be important one day. study the Docs, esp. the Entity Properties section.<br><br>Then you should define a default value for all parameters. The paramters are initialized with these.<br><br>You need some kind of GUI to edit the values. Position and rotation and scaling may work with some kind of mousedriven tool. other things may be common GUI Forms.<br><br>Anyway, after creating and adjusting a scene made of several meshes, you will be able to save all parameters to a file.<br><br>Now that you have all the parameters, it's easy to open the file and read out all parameters, then load and restore the scene as you just saved it before.<br><br>Example:<br><br><pre class=code>
re=readfile("level.lvl")
while not eof(re)
 l$=readline(re) ; mesh filename
 if filetype(l$)&lt;&gt;1
  runtimeerror "Cannot load "+l$
 endif
 m=loadmesh(l$)
 x#=readline(re)
 y#=readline(re)
 z#=readline(re)
 positionentity m,x,y,z
 xs#=readline(re)
 ys#=readline(re)
 zs#=readline(re)
 scaleentity m,xs,ys,zs
 ...and so on
wend
closefile re
</pre><br><br>Using Readline and Writeline for all parameters makes things much easier for you and you  will also be able to visually check a .lvl files content by watching it with notepad. You can easily use a floating point variable to read in a line, the value will automaticly be converted to a number, although Readline returns a String. It's a simple and flexible method that will allow to store both, strings and numbers.<br><br>just make sure you will read the same number of lines from the file as you used to saved. And of course you also need to store the parameters in an array or in types while loading, to be able to free everything from memory later, when you want to load the next level. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
