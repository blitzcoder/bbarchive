The same CPU (AMD single core) is running both loops, in the same program, sequentially at the same time.  If its performance depended on (or was affected by) other programs that were running, then BOTH loops should execute in the same time measurement.  Or, alternatively, if other programs were drawing CPU power away from the program, then there ought to be a randomness in the timing, as in, the first loop gets more time than the second when run at one occasion, but then when run on another occasion, the second loop ought to run faster.<br><br>Empirically, that is not what is happening.  I have run the program again and again and again.  The first loop ALWAYS takes more time than the second, even though there is no discernible difference between them. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
