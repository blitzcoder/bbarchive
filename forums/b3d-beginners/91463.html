I've been working on this for 2 days now, and have made exhaustive use of the code archives and search function.  You all have made many great tutorials, but I'm wondering...<br><br>I've been able to make clients that can connect to the server but only on my local machine using the address 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1' <br><br>Whenever I type in my public IP address the code never works.  At first I thought maybe it was just a firewall issue or something simple, so I messed around with my settings.  A few minutes ago I even loaded a few games (like Quake 3) and had a friend of mine in another state join my game using ip address just to make sure things were set up right, and he was able to connect.<br><br>So are the CreateTCPServer, AcceptTCPStream, and OpenTCPStream commands no longer working over the internet?  I use Windows 7, and would be happy to answer any other questions that might lead to a fix to this.<br><br>I can post the code I'm using right now to if this would help anyone.<br><br>I'm terribly confused and never was very good with network code anyway -_-<br><br>Thanks for any help! &lt;3<br><br>EDIT: I notice that the description for CreateTCPServer says to use it to communicate "between other clients and the local box", but many of the tutorials I've read said it can work over the internet.  Confused :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Other programs I've tested to make sure I wasn't having a problem with my hardware or firewalls all work fine.<br><br>So I'm not sure how to further verify that the port isn't the problem &gt;_&gt;<br><br>Then again I not even 100% sure I actually understood your answer, lol, so I'll keep working with it.

Instead, try running the game using your LAN -- if you can connect and play, you know it's a problem with your router\firewall. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
