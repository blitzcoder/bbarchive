Now this hits me as strange first of all, as thats a lotta triangles to be drawing, but War3 DOES limit on-screen viewing (even in the map editor) up to a maximum of about a 30x30 viewing size (approx 1800 polys - still allowing plenty for character/scenery models, etc). <br><br>However, every square of that can contain a separate texture. Questions:<br><br>1. How can this kind of density be achieved in Blitz? Is using 4096 surfaces (one per square) on a mesh realistic? It doesn't sound it. <br><br>2. How much will this affect performance considering that only 900 of these surfaces are on-screen at a time? <br><br>3. Would splitting up the terrain into say, 64 meshes of 8x8 grid squares each (128 polys, 64 surfaces) be a more likely way to achieve a similar result? Would it save on processing power?<br><br>4. Another alternative - creating a massive image in memory and assigning the single image as the texture and dynamically changing/reassigning the texture to "emulate" an effect of each square having a different texture - possibility or insanity?<br><br>I'm still trying to get my head around some of this 3D stuff. I mean, playing with sprites having a few hundred on-screen seriously hampers performance, so surely having a few-hundred surfaces on-screen is gonna cause an even bigger performance hit. Any ideas/experience appreciated. :)<br><br>+BlackD<br><br>PS. Sorry for asking questions I know I could answer by playing around in Blitz for a while, but I'm not that good in 3D and it'd take me days of coding to find answers some folk here probably already know. :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

When the card has to handle a lot alphaed sprites that are filling most of the screen, it can become real slow, esp. when the camera looks trough a lot of layers of sprites.<br><br>It is true, a high number of seperate surfaces can also slow things down. If I was you, I would combine both: use a number of 1024*1024 texel textures and each of them contains eg: 4*4 textures. So you would have 16 times less surfaces in use. BTW on some cards 1024*1024 is the max anyway. so you couldn't use eg. a 10'000^2texels texture. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This worked very well, and would be how I imagine programs like ALE work to make up large landscapes. I could fit quite a large number of these meshes onto screen and still max out the FPS. Even 512 meshes (a 128X64 map) worked without speed impedence, with 8192 surfaces.<br><br>An interesting thing I found though - while moving around this terrain while zoomed in, it would be very jaggy while moving over "new" areas, then once they were viewed, this movement would be smooth and fast. I attributed this to allocating chunks to video memory, and confirmed it by zooming my camera out to view the whole scene, doing an update and render without a flip, then zooming in to the correct level and re updating/rendering/flipping in the main loop - at which stage because it had all been "viewed" in the non-flipped render, it was now all fast and smooth. What is the cause of this? Does Blitz not load objects into video memory when they are created, only when they are first viewed on-screen? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
