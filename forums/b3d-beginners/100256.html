Blitz3D simply doesn't provide any actual DirectX functions to manipulate the acquired handles on its own.<br><br>I'd say the bigger reason why it's of limited utility is that it's still stuck with DirectX 7, and with FastExtension and so on basically all the mileage that there is to get has been got out of that particular API.<br><br>Because of the ongoing concerns about the long-term viability of DX7, if you really want to do something in that vein, it'd be better to start from scratch and do something with OpenGL 1.1 (OpenGL 1.1 is a "permanent" part of Windows - even though it's deprecated by the Khronos folks, it's a lot less likely to go anywhere any time soon and as long as you stick to the very basic functionality, may actually be the more reliable these days).<br><br>I'm very nearly ready to "officially" re-release <a href="https://github.com/Leushenko/bOGL-2" target="_blank">bOGL version 2</a> (the core engine is there, it mainly needs testing, docs, and addon modules): you might want to keep an eye on that project if you're interested in ultralight 3D engines based on legacy tech. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
