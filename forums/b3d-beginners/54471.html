I have tried using the CreateCube() command, then scalemesh to form its shape into a flattish rectangle.  So far, so good.  Now, when I try painting it (entitytexture) with a "door.jpg" image, it works.  Great!  <br><br>BUT..... the door shows hinges on the left, and when I paint the door image, the hinges are on the left on both sides of the door.  Logically, when hinges on on the left side of a door on one side, they should be on the right side of the door on the other side!  Now, obviously, I can "flip" the image, but how do I get the image to be painted solely on one side (i.e. hinges on left side), instead of all sides (where the door's other side needs hinges on the right side)?<br><br>Another problem:<br>When I use turnentity with this door created via CreateCube(), the door swivels in the middle, as though the hinges were at the dead center of the top and bottom sides, instead of at the left edge (which is where hinges would be located).  What's up with that, and how can I fix it so that the turnentity command will turn it off the side? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

; create the pivot, create the door, then attach the door to the pivot
doorpiv=createpivot()
door=createcube(doorpiv)
scaleentity door, blah, blah, blah
positionentity door, somenumber, somenumber, somenumber

; open the door
turnentity doorpiv, somenumber, somenumber, somenumber

Yes, after I did the post, I remembered that if you use CreateCube() with a parent (in this case, a pivot), then the mesh created will start at 0,0,0, whereas  CreateCube() starts a mesh at -1,-1,-1, and goes to 1,1,1.  Hence, 0,0,0 is at the dead center, and so turnentity "hinges" at the 0,0,0 point, which is why the door turns along the middle (ie turnentity door,0,1,0 along the y-axis).<br><br>The whole UV system is still baffling to me,  as I don't understand UV coordinates and how they relate to a 3D object. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

One is the Freeware Tool Lithunwrap 1.3.<br><br>Every Triangle of a Mesh has 3 UV Coordinates. U and V may be values of 0.0 to 1.0, representing their x/y position on the texture. It doesn't matter if the texture is 256 or 512 Pixel big, the UVs are relative to the size. If you draw a 2D triangle from the 3 UV Coordinates on the texture then you'll see the region of the texture that will be used for that triangle.<br><br>There are two Methods that may be combined:<br>Load a Mesh and use some Unwrapping automation, like Cube-Mapping, Cylindric Mapping, Decal Mapping etc. depending on what's most useful for a specific mesh. Then manually move and scale some parts until the texture space is used most economicly. Then save this as a UV Template. All triangles will be drawn on this BMP. Now you can Load it in a Painting App, use this template as a layer that will guide you where to put the graphics.<br><br>The other Method is to save your Texture in a painting App without to know the UV Coors, then Load the Texture in the UV Mapper App and align the UVs to the graphics.<br><br>When you're orking with Lithunwrap, there are several traps you should know. You cannot assign a selection to a material unless the selection Mode is set to group.<br><br>If you have one group and want two materials, you need to create a new group and assign a Faces Selection to it.<br><br>When Loading a new Materials Bitmap, it will not be displayed by default, you need to save it (after assigning some groups to it, of course), then reload it. Now the texture will be drawn in the background of the UV Space, allowing to align the Faces to it.<br><br>Fot the door problem you would use Cube Mapping, then Align, Scale and mirror the 6 quads (1 quad=2 tris) the way you want. In fact a door is a good first exercise.<br><br>The only problem in Lithunwrap is, usually you are not sure what side is what (up vs down vs left vs right etc.), esp. with a cube mesh whis may be confusing. In this case, save the UV map, draw some individual numbers to all sides, then load it as a material and check the Preview to see what is what. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
