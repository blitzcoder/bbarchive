Whats Blitz Plus. Is this the original Blitz 2D? and if so can Blitz 2D users like me update to it or is it seperate? <br>    I bought Blitz Basic when it first came out for the PC so I have a very early version. I used to run it on WIndows 98, but now I find myself useing Windows NT on a new computer. How do I get it to run on Windows NT? I am a bit worried about installing it in case I mess the computer up - since it isn't mine. Should I get an update first and if so will this make it run with Windows NT? <br>    I have downloaded the most recent update (but not installed it) but I can't see any documentation to download (on the website). Where can I get documentation?<br>    Phew! sorry for all the questions. I hope people can help. Thank you very much. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In most states and countries it is illegal to buy pirated software and possess pirated software.  Blitz does NOT use BUIDs anymore, that was strictly an Idiotcon policy.  Blitz comes with standard reg#s now.  Unlike stolen property which is state crimes, software piracy is federal crimes and carries extremely stiff penalties, up to 20 years in the federal prison.<br><br>This is like buying a top of the line TV from some guy selling them out of the back of his van.  They are obviously stolen and since they were not legally purchased from the legal distributors, you would not be entitled to service, upgrades and support from the manufacturer of the TV as they have received absolutely no $$ for the sale of the stolen TV.

I didn't realise all this about Idigcon. Seems a shame that Blitz can't be available in all outlets - just like all other software. I think I will get Blitz 3D, since even though I'm not writing a 3D game at the moment, it will be good to mess around with it.<br>    Bit of a hassle with these reg numbers though. When I first got Blitz 2D I got a card with a 4 digit number on. Then I spent weeks getting a BUID from Guildhall. Now they've changed it again.
