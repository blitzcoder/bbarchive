Whatever happened to store personnel being nice to customers?  All I see these days (at least in big chains) is a markedly antagonistic attitude toward people in the store.  And people wonder why I only shop online: let's see, it's fast to browse, the stuff is cheaper, there's wider selection, it's easier to get reliable information about the product, the stuff is delivered straight to my front door, and I don't have to deal with hostile 'sales' people.  The only disadvantage is having to wait for my stuff to arrive, and even that is usually only a couple days for delivery.  I guess it's a big hassle to return anything, but with half the stuff I buy retail stores don't accept returns anyway, and for the other half of stuff I order from the websites of retail stores so that I can do my returns at the store. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Indeed, that is the main hardware advantage of Macs over PCs.  They have from the get-go been designed for working with high-end graphics and are the standard choice for computer artists.<br><br>Raw clock speed numbers are misleading because of differences in the underlying chip technology.  A given clock speed on a Mac is about doubled for the equivalent on PC; thus, the highest PowerPC speeds are about equivalent to the highest Pentium speeds.<br><br>Also, a large part of the higher price of Macs is that Apple includes all kinds of pricey gadgetry standard (stuff that is optional on PCs.)  This is of course still a downside if you don't need all that stuff, but knowing this tendency of theirs fills in a lot of the price differential. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
