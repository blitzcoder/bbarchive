By that I mean, not so huge as the sticks they have nowadays.  The throw is too long.  Also the base is so huge you can't really hold them in your hand/lap, so you have less control.<br><br>Also, I don't really like joypads - i never understood controlling with your thumb, which is a clumsy digit.<br>Even worse, your *left* thumb.   Aren't most of us righties? <br><br>You young whipper-snappers probably don't know what I'm talking about, but you old-timers might!<br><br>Any idea where I can look?

But that aside, I can definitely relate to your problem... my hate-hate relationship with joypads started with the stupid little card that came with the Sega Master System; thinking "why oh why isn't this a proper stick?!?" - frankly I'm amazed that they've taken over like they have, I guess that's what 15 years of domination by Japanese consoles will get you.<br><br>What I did once, and I know this isn't for everyone, but I got a genuine old 8-bit era joystick from a pawn shop and a cheap PC gamepad, pulled the guts out of the gamepad and wired it into the switches of the joystick... hey presto...<br><br>Of course nothing beats a good solid arcade stick and buttons, mounted securely on a a big heavy thing of some sort. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It broke so easily. I have about 5 of them as they were being sold at a quid each at one time.<br>The best were Cruiser Green Model and Zipstick. My two Cruiser greens still work and have lasted for 7 years.<br>The thing about joysticks is that they take away the functionality of one of your hands, one or two buttons are ok. I hated the Quickshot Cobra. Having to fire both buttons and move with the same hand. I like having them split on a joypad. Admittedly the Mastersystem square joypad had to be the worst ever made, NES wasn't that much  better. How great they are now though.<br><br>Joypads are much more efficient. Imagine trying to use a PSX pad (except with an arcade style stick) with a stick where the joypad is. It'd just be too hard to find the buttons.<br><br>&gt; Of course nothing beats a good solid arcade stick <br>&gt; and buttons, mounted securely on a a big heavy <br>&gt; thing of some sort. <br><br>I agree. Mincing out those Street Fighter II fireballs was always so satisfying in an arcade cab. I always think I'm performing special moves when I change gear in my car :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It looks like an arcade stick, the stick is microswitched (click click click click!) and the button is not (I think microswitched fire buttons, which I saw in a review of a modern day joystick,  are not a good idea in an action game?), and it is virtually indestructable. Anyway, a friend of mine used to own some kind of converter or game card so that he could attach these '8 bit joysticks' to his PC.
