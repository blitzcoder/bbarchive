On a system like your target system - which is what my laptop pretty much is - I've found that in all my games (which you've played and tested a few) those components of the game usually take no more than 1-6 milliseconds (at worst) in total per frame.  It is almost always the graphics rendering which is the bottleneck in b3d (I'm sure you are aware of this too) - but if you put together some test scenes - even if they are just junk polygons - with the expected scene polycounts/surface counts and account for at least 6ms taken each frame (worst case scenario) in game logic (or similar amount if you know for a fact what the game logic will cost) then you should be able to determine how many and how complex your md2/b3d character models can be.  <br><br>On another note:<br>It is kind of possible to have md2s with swappable weapons.  Look at the way quake 2 models were designed  - the weapons were a separate md2 model which was animated to be in the appropriate spot on the character model for each frame of the character's animation.  Fairly easy to do - simply animate the model with its weapon in your 3d package and then export the model and the weapon as separate md2s.  <br><br>I never played the original syndicate other than a small demo which was available many years ago (and my friend's original disks had become corrupted so unable to play at all now..) but what I did play was great fun - the persuadertron was great, as was loading the cars full of civilians then blowing it up...truly nasty game..brings out the worst in people...but great fun nonetheless.<br><br>I think your game could possibly run fine on a middle of the road system. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
