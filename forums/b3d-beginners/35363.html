The problem was and *is*, that without custom samples you don't have a clue about how good or bad it sounds on a random consumer-PC. Sure.. it'll all be GM, so voice 1 will be a piano.. but GM is only a format-standard.. not a sound-standard.. it's completely free for a soundcard/synth company to add a 64mb rom or a 512kb rom with GM sounds. For obvious reasons the latter one stinks. Add the fact that cheap soundcards don't always have DSP functionality onboard (like reverb and chorus) doesn't help too..<br>Now and then indie-games appear with MIDI music.. and perhaps it's me, but I think it all stinks. Usually I don't play games with crap-music behind it. As many movie-directors agree on: music is one of the most important aspects of a movie, in terms of atmosphere and excitement.<br><br>GM, the worst invention in consumer-music-technology history. There's nothing creative about it, many important instruments are missing, polyphony is a pain in the ass, .. it just sucks beyong reckognision :)<br><br>A freaky example: I've both Diablo2+exp AND Baldur's Gate (The Forgotton Realms). I only played D2, and only looked briefly at BG. Reason? BG didn't have music at the town where you start (or maybe only very short, I don't remember it). Might be a stupid arguement, but I really want good music, otherwise I don't play it! Even if I have bought the game! (like I did :) D2, I'd like to add, has outstanding music.<br><br>So, my bottomline: don't skimp on the music.

I thought MOD was the answer because, based on textual descriptions, it sounded like a great format that fell by the wayside.  Your description makes it sound like it wasn't quite all it was cracked up to be in terms of sample quality and cross-platform uniform-ness.  I hope whatever might surprise me in a few months addresses these issues and makes the creation of realistic OGG music as easy as Winjammer makes the creation of quirky little MIDI files that rely wholly on a quality insturment patch. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
