If the EoF is reached and there is no Secondary "tag", or perhaaps even no primary "tag" (which is possible) then a null result or Fail can be returned<br><br>___<br><br>Now, if the data as a whole is contained as a STRING (data read as "ReadLine"), then Instr() can quickly(?) jump to the required instances of Tags, however, String functions are notoriously slow by default. The data must be less than 65536 bytes in length too and cannot contain 10,13 as these represent ASCII control demarking End Of Line<br>___<br><br>Alternatively, I could use ReadBytes and transfer the ENTIRE data into a Bank from the file, but doing so would  then require bytes to be individually read one by one.<br><br>___<br><br>So which method ought to be faster, given the approximate, typical sixe of the data to be around 30Kb or so ? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you want to treat it as a flat array of binary objects, perhaps a bank would be better. A bank might also be better if you plan to modify the data in-place rather than reconstruct the whole thing when you need to save.<br><br>So on the whole it sounds like your best option would be ReadString (not ReadLine), assuming you have control over the way the data is written; if not, ReadBytes. (Converting a bank to a string and back again can also be fast enough for realtime use: <a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/codearcs/codearcs.php?code=2972" target="_blank">http://www.blitzbasic.com/codearcs/codearcs.php?code=2972</a> ) Although to be honest I'd be surprised if loading 30Kb takes any noticeable time at all no matter the method, unless you're repeating this for hundreds of files.<br><br>It sounds a bit like you're reinventing XML... perhaps also consider using an existing XML framework? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Speed doesn't matter if it's not in a loop - which file operations never should be so there's no issue here. Don't waste your mental energy "optimising" things that aren't bottlenecks.
