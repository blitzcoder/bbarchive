This will keep UV Coodrs intact. But as soon as you use stuff like Compound Object (boolen subtraction etc.), things go mad and you'll have to remap the thing, which is the heaviest work IMHO.<br><br>Personally I prefere to use CharacterFX for Character Animation, but watch out, Pacemaker has just been released! (See Blitz Discussion Forum)And it's Freeware Version even handles up to 1500 Tris. It's used to make Bones based Animations, using the .B3D Format.<br><br>Basicly you need to assign all Vertices to a bone. In the lates Version of blitz the vertices can have a relative connection to the bone (and to multiple bones), this is giving more flexibility, but it also complicates things a bit.<br><br>Creating Animations using keyframe interpolation is something that requires some experience. You have to study human motion. If you find some soccer slowmotion avis with people running from left to right, the watch it closely.<br><br>Halo and me we once tried to start an Animation pool, but it died due to low activity. Now halo was anouncing  a new tool he's gonna release, that will be able to add animation to models, just the thing you are after.<br><br>Anyway, when you are fit with CharacterFX, one loop such as "walking" may take 1 hour of work or so. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I only use Milkshape to convert Models.<br><br>In CFX you need to import a Mesh. Then Create the Skeleton. Then assign the vertices to the bones. usually you would assin all vertices of the lower arm to the ellbow bone (which is the lower arm bone, but it's pivot center is the ellbow, the connection to the next bone in the hierarchy). So when you rotate the lower arm, the vertices of the lower arm will follow.<br><br>It may take some time until you're familar with the controls of CFX, eg. Select and unselect Vertives using shift, alt and ctrl combinations (tho it's written at the bottom). If you have once assigned the vertives to the bones properly, the fun begins.<br>Animation Keyframing etc. is a nice Job imho, compared to Vertex assignement.<br><br>BTW. I wouldn't use 100 frame sfor a walking cylce. 20 or 30 works pretty good for me.<br>Probably I'll write a lil tutorial soonish. Tho I am not Mr. Animation or something.<br><br>(BTW it might be a good idea to set the very first frame of a cycle sequence to be a keyframe for EVERY bone/part of the model, to make sure it will loop correctly) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Although Milkshape doesn't support blended vertex weights so you can't set those up outside CharacterFX.
