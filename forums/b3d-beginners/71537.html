I am new to blitz. I dont know much code, only very basic. I was just kinda wondering. All of you on this site, how long did it take to get as good at coding as you all are, and what did you do to get that good?<br><br>I was just kinda wondering, because i find coding hard at the moment, and it is getting easier in time, but i just want to know, about how long it took for all you awesome coders to get as good as you are, giving me an idea of how long it will take me. <br><br>Thanks very much! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I did a bit of it in college too, but I learned the most when a buddy and I decided to try and make some casual games using Blitzmax. Just set little goals for yourself, get one or two things figured out each day, and then you'll have a game in no time. Though I would probably recommend starting with Blitzmax rather than Blitz3d....theres a lot less to worry about with 2D games.<br><br>The fact that the community on these sites is so awesome is a huge plus too. It would've taken me much longer to get my games out if it wasn't for these forums.<br><br>Now I work fulltime as a game developer. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I've been using blitz3d for around 3-4 months and i can whip up good programming rapidly, i suck at constructing algorithms though.  I have however been at coding for a hobby for 2 years now.

Im always learning new stuff though so am certainly no 'guru' but thats 50% of the fun isnt it :)<br>If you usethese forums you will learn blitz in no time as its a great community and (most) people really want to help.
