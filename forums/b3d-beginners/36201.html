Simple, now turn on imagescollide and it slows and interrupts big time. Its not that imagescollide is slow at all, because when you arn't drawing and just moving the mouse around, it collides fast, and detects, ect. it only crawls when you try to Draw to ImageBuffer, and then after check it with imagescollide. like its not releasing it fast enough for imagescollide to do its work or something, Why, even using lockbuffers, doesn't help. <br><br>Any way to get this to work right, maybe poke/peek to a bank? i dunno, just need to draw and check for collisions at the same time.

In this way, you have the writepixel stuff out from the main loop, and your prog will be much more smooth.<br><br>Finally, you should avoid Flip True, and just use Flip instead; perhaps you can use a timer too, which will ensure your main loop running always at a constant speed; check for CreateTimer and WaitTimer commands.<br><br>Hope this helps,<br>Sergio. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Its like the game snake, except your line doesn't grow, its a line always left behind, i've looked at "snake" game examples, but they all use the TYPE method, of say holding each block of the snake in a type and moving around like that, but here i'm talking about pixels, and a huge screen, plus Many players on the screen at once, that would be alot of stuff to run through, and just seems to be a waste, when it would be so so simple to. Draw on background Image that guys are running all over, and if they collide with crap left on Background Image, then kill player. So Simple, but seems to be a bug in using imagescollide after doing a write to the imagesbuffer.<br><br>As you can see when doing imagescollide ever update is not a problem, it is very fast (draw something then move mouse around points you drawed, and see it collides and all that very fast, no stops) so that is not a problem at all, take out the imagescollide and then go and draw, drawing to image if Very Fast also. So why can't you draw to the image and then check for imagescollide <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
