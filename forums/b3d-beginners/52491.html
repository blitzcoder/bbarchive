</pre><br>This gives me 2 leagues, 10 teams in each, each team has 20 players.<br>It means each player is linked to a club, is linked to a league.... (expandable in future for each league to a country, each country to a continent etc)<br><br>I can then create a "new game" type which kicks off all the rest ready to be initialised and assigned values:<br><pre class=code>
Global p.game=New game
p\league[0]=New league
p\league[0]\team[0]=New team
p\league[0]\team[0]\player[0]=New player
p\league[0]\team[0]\player[0]\name="Peter Shilton"
</pre><br><br>Is there a better way to do this as I kind of think I am hard coding it by using BlitzArrays[], although I will know the max limits of all the arrays (leagues,clubs,players).<br><br>The other way I was thinking of doing it was by assigning each player a teamID, and each team a leagueID and doing it that way, but then I`d have to search through the whole database of players just to display the players that play for Swansea (search all players clubID field for a match)<br><br>I have to think about players transferring as well, which is why I had the "clubID field" idea, but I guess as each team has a max squad of 20 (in the above code) then if u buy or sell a player (both teams must have space) then u simply move the player and slot him into the new slot with the new club values...?<br>ie:<br><pre class=code>p\league[0]\team[0]\player[0]=p\league[1]\team[12]\player[18]</pre><br>But - how would I then delete the original reference to the player, whilst not deleting the "space" so to speak...<br>I have tried making it =NULL and using Delete, but then I get "Object does not exist" errors....I don`t really want to delete it, I guess just wipe it clean ready for the next player....<br><br>I also notice that copying the player the way I have in the code above means that when I blank or delete the original (0,0,0) then it also affects the new one.<br>Do you have to manually copy every field or is there a workaround for copying the entire type like I have above and still being individual?<br><br>I`m beginning to ramble so I`ll wait for some reply if I`ve missed out any info.<br><br>Basically - is there another better way?<br><br>Cheers! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Your solution is the simplest for Blitz Basic.<br><br>Note that if you want to allow less than the maximum number of items per array (e.g. a league with only 9 teams) you can either leave the unused slots NULL, or have an "exists" field for each object.  Don't forget you'll need to test for unused slots anytime you loop through your objects.<br><br>You may also consider adding "parent" references.  Being able to find out which team a player is on (given only a player object) or which team a league belongs to may be useful.<br><br>Given what you've told us you need to be able to do with your objects, there wouldn't be much benefit to using linked lists.  There wouldn't be any drawbacks either, except for the added complexity involved in getting them to work in Blitz Basic.  Personally, I'd use them anyways, but that's a matter of taste. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
