I can create a surface yes but how do I choose which triangles should becontained by the specific surface.

Any change on a surface means full reupload of the whole surface to graphic card anyway.<br>If you want to see whats within a surface, you can use CountTriangles and TriangleVertex and the VerteX / Y / Z commands <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I think it should be possible to use the data in the file. And it would make sense trying that before writing a program with which you can paint to triangles. <br>You say the model loads correctly now, right ? So both the textures applied to the model are showing in the right place ? If that is the case, blitz must have loaded the data somehow. And there is only one surface ? Maybe the exporter merged the two textures into one bigger texture ? Or the model has multiple texture layers applied to it ?<br>I'm conviced that there is a solution for this. Maybe you could post a .3ds testing model ? <br>If you think it is the .3ds format that causes the trouble: in 3dsmax, you could export .x files using the panda exporter and i believe the b3d pipeline to export .b3d files. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
