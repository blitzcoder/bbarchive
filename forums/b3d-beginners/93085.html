Include 3 and 4 do "know" whatever is declared in include 1, but you cannot for example access an array in Include 1  that was dimed in include 4.<br><br>Functions may be whereever you wish, their position in the code doesn't matter when you call them. You really have to imagine you are replacing the line "include "myfile.bbinc"" by the ascii content of entire myfile.bbinc. That's what the compiler does.<br><br>edit:<br>To definitely understand these things you should know more about the way the compiler works. I don't know these things in detail: There are several compiling passes, so functions and as far as I know also Types are read in a seperate pass, so there won't be  a "function not found" error. This would be legal:<br><br>print "hello"<br>function do_nothin()<br>a=0<br>end function<br>print "world"<br>end<br><br>But the function would not be executed. Personally I am using a more strict structure than what Blitz3D expects:<br>First I declare all Variables and Types, everything is initialised, then there is a mainloop, after the mainloop the end and after the End will follow all functions and DATA, if present.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2010</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The "Include" does not affect runtime, only compilation. However, if there's actual procedural instructions or funciton calls in included files, these are run in order of the inclusion.<br><br>I recommend just having constants, globals and variables in Include files, and all necessary dependancies included at the beginning of the 'main' file, with any procedural "runnable" code kept in the Main.<br>Any functions, globals and constants declared in the include files can then be accessed from the Main file.<br><br>Hopefully this should demonstrate it all a little clearer:<br><br>If you make 3 small files with the filenames as commented below, you can then execute the 'Main.bb' and see the results!<br><pre class=code>

They have no bearing on how the code gets compiled, or how the compiled code behaves at run-time.<br><br>Source code that's broken up into include files will be compiled to exactly the same object code as source code that's all placed into the one file.<br><br>One issue to be aware of though, is that relative filepaths for include files are relative to the main source file for your program, rather than being relative to the file that contains the 'Include' statement. This means that, if you have a library of systems that you use frequently in different projects, and which you incorporate into your various projects by including them, then you need to have all the code for each system inside a single file. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
