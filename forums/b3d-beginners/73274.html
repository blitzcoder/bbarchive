The player, explores a pre-defined universe, creates a  settlement, buildings, mines for resources, builds war machines, and other products.. sells them on a Game wide auction system to other players who are playing and doing these things at the same time.. if 2 players get in conflict, the zone inwhich their fighting, will display a 2d top down representation of the zone their in, with icons for the unit's in play.. including the unit's armor, shields, weapons and ammo status.. the player should be able to log in for the first time, create a login and password.. which will set up their account.. etc..<br><br>is writing a game like this beyond the capability of the Blitz products? which would be better to write the game in? blitzbasic (blitz2d) or blitz 3d? would someone be willing to talk to me about the game, give me a few pointers on the proper way to start? im very eager to learn and have nothing but time.. but i do need someone to help and atleast set me on the right path. please help me!<br><br>email me at Killian@... if you want to talk about this in private. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This all sounds possible with blitz, but it would take a lot of time, especially the networking.  You would have to create a server, potentially your computer to act as one, or buy a computer to act as a server, which if the game is to be commercial, would be ideal.  I don't know much (anything) about networking with blitz, but as long as blitz can do local and global network changes (display different things per computer based on a set of variables global to all players), this oughta be possible.  <br><br>If you need someone to do some graphics for you, let me know at chwaga@... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I cannot seem to find the bug report that was placed for this about a year ago (?) but I know it hindered one user from deploying a network game due to the requirement (not on the box mind you) that blitz requires a mouse/keyboard and/or soundcard or else it throws an error.  That was a while ago though and may have been fixed. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
