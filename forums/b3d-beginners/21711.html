Overuse of Goto is bound to turn your program into a big mess... In this example it's not superbad, since it's an easy one, when doing complex programming like programming a game, you will get your code into an even bigger mess, and debugging will be hell, and if you have to carry over your code to another programmer, he won't be able to make out any sense out of it... That's why Goto is considered the forbidden command... It's implented for emergency purposes, but it's usage should always be avoided if possible... As long as you only use it when you don't have another choice, you can keep track of things, as soon as you start using it for everything you'll loose control over everything, making debugging, next to impossible... <br><br>A programmer's rules seems to be, the less of gotos the better the programmer... Not completly true, but the less gotos are used, the more organized your source will be and that's worth a lot... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

For example, if you always use the variable "Loop" to do a loop, and then you have a gosub in the loop, and in that gosub you do another loop...  You're in trouble. :-)<br><br>Of course I only do this for the sake of convenience.  It's just faster to clean up my code by moving gosubs out of main loops than by creating tons of extra global variables to pass data between all the functions.<br><br>I am trying though to find a way to move to a completely structured approach and get rid of my gosubs.  Whenever I find a gosub which I can move into a function without too much converson effort I do that.<br><br>IF you want an example of why I use gosubs, then here's one. <br><br>In my game, I have a level editor built into the game, and in that level editor there is a "tag editing mode".  In the editor you can select tags.  So to do that I have a variable called SelectedTag.Tag.  This is used by the editing functions and preserved between frames.  So either it has to be a local variable in the main program, or a global variable.  Local is better natually.  If it was a local function variable then there would be no way to preserve it between frames.  Also, this variable needs to be accessed by the Render_2D subroutine, which is another gosub.  This one renders the 2D stuff over the 3D scene.  And in doing so, it needs to access SelectedTag so it can print the tag's data on the screen.<br><br>Now you might say that I could return SelectedTag from the Get_Local_Input function, and then pass it as a parameter to the Render_2D_Overlay.  But that seems kind of ugly.  I mean does it really make sense to return a tag from a function that gets user input?  Besides which, you can onyl return ONE variable from a functon.  I definitely have other data like this that needs to be passed around the code a lot.<br><br>In C I suppose one might return a pointer to a structure from a function and have that contain the data.  But it seems yucky to create a bunch of types each one specific to the data a particular function needs to return.<br>  <br>Then again, perhaps that is the way of the future.  Seems pretty illogical for functions to only be able to return one peice of data.  But that does make A = Foo() a lot easier to write.  Then again, it's not really hard to write like A = (Kung)Foo() to return the variable Kung from the function Foo().  And A = Foo() could return a pointer to a strucutre containing for that function. <br><br>I dunno. :-)  Strutured programming isn't an exact science.  Personally I think what would benefit structured programming most is a better IDE.  The inability to add invisible comments to a section of code clutters up code and actually makes it harder to read when you have a lot of comments.  But then, who besides me actually comments their code that much? :-)  It would also be nice to be able to treat code like a series of folders in explorer.  That would make it MUCH easier to spot nesting errors in your code, because you could click a little + sign next to each if or else statement to collapse the code within it and then you'd see exactly what gets collpased.  It would also be good to have barely visible brackets which encompass said nests of code so that again it's easier to see which code is within each nest. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Functions excel at manipulating the values you pass them and returning a result... it's what they do; The way they're now pushed so heavily as the de facto way to cordon off a subroutine is totally puzzling to me: I remember, while attempting picking up a bit of C++, the whole fandango involving void functions and pointers JUST TO MOVE A BIT OF CODE ON THE SCREEN IN ORDER TO MAKE IT MORE ORGANISED struck me as the most awkward-for-its-own-sake approach imaginable (and, if I'm honest, I mention it now largely in the hope that someone better versed in C++ will say "Sledge you pleb, you can branch easily like this instead..." as I still can't quite belive that the language is so unaccommodating). Branching isn't just done for the sake of constructing a more optimal exe, it's done in order to increase the presentability of the source code too -- Gosub is worth its weight in gold for this and should definitely not be classed alongside Goto and dismissed with it.<br><br><br><br>EDIT: Deleted accidental Paste <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

How?<br><br>9572AD, I remember that being stressed too. That don't bother me none so long as my game runs tho. Plenty of bad habits in there, but it has just enough structure to hold itself up until it's all finished. About as good as it gets with me; I'd have to do some severe disciplining before I could work on a large team/large project. Which I have no intention of ever doing, anyway. So, er, yes, that philosophy does have merit I think. But so does doing things any old way, if it works for you. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
