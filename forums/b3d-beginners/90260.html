I'm currently getting ahold of all the resources necessary for this, even if it doesn't go beyond a DLL that is accessed by Max.<br>That wouldn't be so bad. It is exactly what the Xors3D engine is doing right now, with their BMax module: they provide a DLL and the module grabs the functions from it for use in BMax. It doesn't use classes, just integer handle casts (I think the only reason Xors3D does that is so their source is not exposed so much, because they could've also gone with static Imports using CPPs, headers and whatnot).<br><br><div class="quote"> Edit: let me repeat: I would buy a new Blitz3D that is DX9 or 10 based. <br></div>Oh, sure, count me in as well. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Of course, if you don't hold these benefits in high regard, then there's no problem in using Blitz3D. I used it a lot too; it's just that now Max looks like the 'next' step towards improvement.
