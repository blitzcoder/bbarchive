The "type" here is best illustrated by the following command from the Blitz Help:<br><div class="quote"> EntityType entity,collision_type[,recursive]<br>Parameters<br>entity - entity handle <br>collision_type - collision type of entity. Must be in the range 0-999. <br>recursive (optional) - true to apply collision type to entity's children. Defaults to false.  <br><br>Description<br>Sets the collision type for an entity. <br><br>A collision_type value of 0 indicates that no collision checking will occur with that entity. A collision value of 1-999 will mean collision checking will occur. <br> <br></div><br>You have the choice of 1 to 999 for setting types.  So, if you decide that bullets are going to be type 1, and doors type 2, walls type 3, enemies type 4, etc, then you can check to see if a collision occurred with any of these, on a per-type basis (ie did a collision occur with a bullet, instead of a wall?).  The reason for this variety is that collision checking will have different possibilities via the Collisions command:<br><div class="quote"> Collisions src_type,dest_type,method,response<br>Parameters<br>src_type - entity type to be checked for collisions. <br>dest_type - entity type to be collided with. <br><br>method - collision detection method. <br>1: ellipsoid-to-ellipsoid collisions <br>2: ellipsoid-to-polygon collisions <br>3: ellipsoid-to-box collisions <br><br>response - what the source entity does when a collision occurs. <br>1: stop <br>2: slide1 - full sliding collision <br>3: slide2 - prevent entities from sliding down slopes  <br> <br></div><br>Bullets you may want to come to a full stop when they colide, but if you collide with a wall, you may want to slide.<br><br>Finally, the handle that is returned ("entity_that_collided" in my example above) is useful because you won't usually want to know merely that *A* bullet collided, but *WHICH* bullet collided (ie so you can delete it, if nothing else).  And, of course, if it's doors you are testing for collision with, then you will want to know *WHICH* door, based on what might lie behind it.<br>Hope this helps. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

</pre><br>By the way, 3 is the bullet's type for collisions.<br><br>Also, about mindstorm's method... I don't see how that prevents weird things from happening when 2 things collide at once because Blitz will check one thing at a time, even if you do it the old-fashioned way.  Also, since you use n = 1 to CountCollisions(entity), wouldn't that mean that if the player collided with only the wall, CountCollisions would return 1 because the player only hit the wall, but then if a bullet's type is 1 and the wall's type is 3, the player would run into the wall and act like he hit a bullet?  I don't see how that method works at all, because it cycles through numbers, but the numbers don't necessarily stand for what the player hit. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

When you create the entity, you will need to assign to it what type of entity it is (ie bullet=3).<br><br>As far as 2 (or more) things colliding at once, collisions are put into a queue (a list).  Blitz will automatically set into motion the response that you already assigned via Collisions (ie, stop, slide, etc).  Your interest, then, is not how to handle the collision as such, since the Collisions command does that for you, but to determine what else you want to happen as a result of the collision (ie a bullet damages/kills the target entity, etc).<br><br>mindstorm's method is good.  It allows for the possibility of sorting out what types of collisions occurred (ie collision with an entity of type 1, type 2, type 3, etc.), and allows you to set up what you want to happen on the basis of what KIND of entity you collided with (ie bullet, wall, etc). <br><br>Say your player character collides with a wall just as he gets shot with a bullet.  The Collisions settings will tell Blitz that, for instance, colliding with the wall will allow you to slide, whereas the bullet hitting will just stop dead in its tracks (heh heh, play on words, dude).  Now, regarding the colliding with the wall, say for instance, you don't really want anything special to happen to the player character, but are content to allow him to "slide".  However, since a bullet also hit him, now, you have to work on what damage was done.  mindstorm's method allows you tp sort through the list of collisions so that you can focus in on the bullet hitting, and have your code do appropriate damage to the player.  The code for sorting it all out should look something like this:<br><pre class=code>
For loop=1 to CountCollisions(player_entity)
  which_entity=CollisionEntity (player_entity,loop)
  my_type=GetEntityType (which_entity)
  ;put in code for handling what you want to happen
  ;with entity named which_entity based on which
  ;entity type it is, according to the my_entity that 
  ;was returned from GetEntityType.
Next
</pre><br>So, the logic is as follows:<br>Step 1:<br>CountCollisions tells how many collisions there were<br>(Blitz keeps track of this).<br>Step 2:<br>CollisionEntity tells which entity collided.<br>Step 3:<br>GetEntityType  tells what type entity it was.<br><br>Now, you have an identification, not merely that a collision occurred, but which entity did the colliding, and what type entity it is.<br><br>Cheers  :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That way the in-built collisions system does not have to deal with collisions between two moving objects because one type is always static while the other is moving. There are, however, complexities in managing such a system (bullets would have to be offset while you moved the player, to keep them relatively static, for example) and I would personally do everything to avoid it. But it's an option so I mentioned it for the sake of being complete. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I notice in the code posted that you have no Updateworld between moving your bullets and processing collisions - best to move all your bullets, then deal with any collisions afterwards (ie in a separate loop) I think. But yeah, you need Updateworld in there because that is the command that processes all the collisions stuff.<br><br><div class="quote"> <br>Edit: Sledge, what did you use for Ice-Teroids bullets? <br> <br></div><br>Ice-Teroids uses MeshesIntersect(), slinkily sidestepping any and all collisions issues.<br><br><div class="quote"> <br>For all of Mark Sibly's godliness, this whole collisions issue really sucks.<br> <br></div><br>It's not so much that it sucks, rather it's geared towards particular things - I mean if you want sliding collision between the player and a static level (and somewhere along the line you generally do) then it's life-savingly brilliant. Given that Blitz3D is a language rather than an engine, the amount of automated collisions stuff you get is really rather sweet; but no, it's not comprehensive and you have to give yourself time to get used to its limitations/foibles. I can only really refer you back to the example I posted, which shows you working collisions between bullets and a moving target - I know having to use spheres is a limitation, but you could use several to construct a more complex collision body if required.<br><br>Keep us posted! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
