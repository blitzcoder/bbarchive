And the language can also be expanded, using external DLLs, either the Windows standard or thirdy party created dlls.<br><br>The language is powerful and self explanatory, the exe is incredible fast, and the BlitzPlus exes run on any machine with win 9x, included NT. The newest Blitz3D update - which is FREE for all registered users, as the previous ones - includes also cubemapping capability, which opens the possibility of programming astonishing 3D commercial games.<br><br><div class="quote"> <br>I will explain why ! <br><br>1) The IDE: This is a stupid IDE And the 'check error' is useless ! <br>a) He give the error but Not the location of it. <br>Where can i found an error like "Too many parameters" Or <br>"Function xxxxxx not found". <br>Using the Function 'Find' of this stupid IDE is Not a solution, but only <br>a loosing of time. <br> <br></div><br>You are partially right here. Bare in mind that the IDE, as far as I know, is still under development.<br><br>The offending error location is given by the debugger, which can be turned on from within the IDE menu. It would give you the statement where the error has occurred.<br><br>The search function works for me; it is also true, that the search string should be set for each source tab, though.<br><br>Anyway, the IDE is simple but yet an effective editor. And while you program, you may don't want to be distracted by all the whistles-and-bells options from other editors.

As said, one strong point of Blitz is his compatibility. Of course, you can't pretend that 3D commands are compiled by a 2D compiler, and that special 2D window commands - like already said, canvas, gadgets, windows,.. - are compatible with a 3D language which does not supports such commands. Do you ask for apples when you want to buy oranges ?<br><br><div class="quote"> <br>b) This will make a lot of BlitzBasic different versions like in the good <br>old time where all home computers had differents BASIC with the same <br>functions but incompatible because of the different syntax Or commands <br>name. <br> <br></div><br>Again, I ignore the source of your informations, which IMHO are totally wrong.<br><br><div class="quote"> <br>3) There is NO SUPPORT FROM BLITZBASIC, i have send 2 e-mail with questions <br>about how To acces at the API of windows.

The support consists in:<br>- new updates of the language with new commands and eventually bug fixes;<br>- a very friendly forums where you may find the answers to your questions;<br>- the forum code archives, which is a repository of useful source code snippets, which covers several topics, in both 2D and 3D programming.<br>As in the real life, if you post a thread in a gentle and correct way, you may get help from lots of users. If you, instead, act like an immature and shoot nasty words at 360 degrees, then you can't complain if you get no help. <br><br><div class="quote"> <br>a) This is absolutly Not professional And Not serious. <br>This is just good For an amateur shareware company because If i <br>had asked something at Borland, i had already got an answear. <br> <br></div><br>I personally have written already some professional game with Blitz, and so several other users. Some of the game have also been published. I suggest you to check and discover by yourself how many Blitz games are already published - you may be surprised.<br><br>And, if you ask Borland with the same unprofessional style you are using here, I bet you will only get banned.<br><br><div class="quote"> <br>b) When i will get a more problematic question about BB, i will never get <br>an answear. <br>This is Not professional And Not serious enterprise. <br>I will never buy another product Or upgrade, And will never recommand <br>BlitzBasic. <br> <br></div><br>Again, the problem is not the language, is the way you act with the community.

How Then must you do To call <br>some WinAPI that it need it ? <br>Where are the basics 'dialog box' Or the 'Menu functions' in BB ? <br>There is'nt ! <br> <br></div><br>Again, you find the menu function and all the basic dialog box in the BlitzPlus command set.

Certains emulateurs ont evolues pour traduire 100% des fonctions de la<br>machine source simplement en ajoutant les opcode et les fonctions neccessaires. <br><br>Si tu est un programmeur de langage tels que Turbo-Pascal/Delphi (ou FreePascal GRATUIT et complet) <br>ou de Borland Builder C++, tu sais qu'il suffit de rajouter les fonctions dans la bibliotheque<br>de BB et d'adapter l'interpreteur/compilateur de BB.<br>Si le code source de BB est clair et bien documente, c'est une operation sans douleurs.<br><br>Mais il est evidamment plus rentable de vendre 2 produits differents basée sur un algorithme<br>déjà écrit qu'il suffit d'adapter.<br><br>Tu avoue toi-meme que BB manque un peu de puissance et de fonctions de base (byte, pointeurs, ect...)<br>mais tu achete toute les version BB, ce qui fait de toi un bon client rentable pour Blitz Ltd.<br><br>Personnellement, je prefere le compilateur Delphi (que j'utilise uniquement en tant que compilateur<br>pascal-objet sans les VCL qui bouffent un max de RAM pour rien, <br>un simple "Hello world" sans VCL = +-16 Ko, avec VCL plus de 380 Ko, beurk !) pour sa puissance<br>d'un langage structure, clair et puissant car toute les tailles et types de donnees sont<br>possible. Mon seul regret, c'est l'absance en standard d'une librairie pour acceder aux API de<br>DirectX.<br><br>BB Max, encore un autre BB ! Au lieu  de creer un BB complet !<br>Il aurait mieux valu cree une bibliotheque de fonctions qui aurait simplifier la programmation,<br>et qui aurait put etre compatible avec tout les compilateurs (comme FastGraph, par exemple).<br>Le devellopement/programmation de jeux et autres aurait alors ete aussi rapide qu'avec BB.<br>BB en fait, n'appelle que les API existantes en simplifiant leurs init et parametres.<br>En programmant une API chaque jour pour en simplifier la programmation, on peut avoir au bout d'une<br>année 365 fonctions differentes dans une tres petite librairie de fonctions.<br>C'est juste une programmation peu interessante et qui prend du temps.<br>Mais je pense malgré tout mis mettre, car une telle bibliotheque n'existe pas et serai tres utile pourtant.<br><br><br>Bonne chance pour ton jeu.<br><br><br>For James L Boyd, Blitz Basic Support. <br><br>Well very strange, i never get YOUR e-mail but i get every others e-mail.<br>Computers are really very strange, sometimes they have bad humors. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Before I started using Blitz, I used other languages, one of them was the horrible Dark Basic Pro.  I got used to working in it, even when the syntax was and is horrible, but that's all I knew.  I downloaded the B3D demo and didn't try doing anything in it, until a year later, but once I started doing things on Blitz, I found out, is not bad at all, it all depends on what you want to do, Blitz has incredible capabilities, and you can expand them using the userlibs and dlls.  Of course is not C++ or Java, but if you can save time, and you can deliver quality that's all that matters. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I must say that my first impression isn't one of awe.<br><br>Lastly I'll say it is indeed unfortunate that you don't like Blitz. I've used it as far back as I can remember, on the Amiga and the PC.
