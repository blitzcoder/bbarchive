One of the loop goes from 0..479 and the other one from 1..479. The first loop causes GrabImage to grab an image at (0, -1). I did run the code and it works (very nice). To run it, I pasted the function into the main loop. I did that to avoid defining all variables globally.

I was forgotten that to put in. But in the working code it is in. Your suggestion to use CopyRect was used to. Even on that i got the same problem. I have another copmuter by the hand and wil try to install Blitz3D on that computer. On that computer is stil the version directX 8.1 on it. If the code is working on that computer than i know that its not Blitz3D who give the problem but DirectX. I am suspecting that DirectX is the problem. Because you already say's that the code works on you computer. <br>I have two reasons why i suspecting DirectX. <br>1. A few mounths ago after installing a game my DirectX was corrupted. Game did not started and a lot of other games did not run anymore. All giving the same error. I did reinstall DirectX. And the only way to install it was in save mode.<br>2. I did updated another Basic (Dark Basic) And that basic needed a new type of DirectX. They delivered it also in the update. Is was Redist.exe version Directx 9.0c August 2006. All games working except Settlers 2 10th anniversary.<br>And now blitz3d. <br>I can't deinstall this version of directX. I did try it using differend programs. All say the same. This version is not supported. <br>So in a nut shell. I'am stuck whit what is got. I can not reinstall the computer because its a company computer. <br>So the wait is for the test on the other computer. And a wait for a new version of DirectX. <br><br>Al in one. Please stay giving me responce so that i can find a solution for this. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

</textarea><br>I think you can make a workaround for this trouble, since images with a height of 5 are working, create the images at 640x5, but only CopyRect one line on it. This way you'll need 4 times more memory, but you can avoid this nasty bug. And have you installed the lasted Blitz ? Maybe you could try downgrading to a previous version.<br><br>(edit)<br>He, I was thinking .. maybe you could load the image with LoadAnimImage, and then set the tilesize to 640x1 .. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Both did run the exe and the there one compiled progam. And both run the program without any problem. And the real luck was that one computer was the same as mine. So i am now realy sure that the problem is DirectX. Now i must find a solution to resolve this problem.

And have made a workaround for it. Its even working on the other computers to. So program fixed. <br><br>The solution: Its stupid but its work.<br>The mistake that DirectX make is that every odd liven is a interlace line. This mean that the odd lines are desktop lines. This means that i only can use even lines to grab a image. I load the image 2 times in the program. One starting on line 1 and one starting on line 2. Then reading every line in by switching the reading image. And when i done that i can use all the lines to draw on the screen. No distorsion what so ever. In a nice sinus wave. Thanks for the help. This is maybe somthing for people who had simulair problems. <br><br>This bug wil be fixed in DX10. They made this bug in the progam by mistake. To preserve the desktop the image is tranfered to memory. but somhow its overlaying the other memory bank that Blitz3D use. They call it interlace screening. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
