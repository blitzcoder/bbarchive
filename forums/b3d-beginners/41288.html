Warning: [24] A document type declaration should appear as the first line (line 1) of every HTML document. For example, for HTML 4.01 Strict documents, &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"&gt; should be the first line. For HTML 4.01 Transitional documents, the first line should be &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd"&gt;.

An accessible page is one that more individuals can use, such as individuals who are blind or deaf. It can also increase the usefulness of your web page for individuals who browse the web using slower devices like older computers or wireless devices like cell phones and PDAs. An accessible web site makes good business sense (and possibly good legal sense as well). You can enable or disable accessibility checking in the Validator Engine Options.<br><br>50. Comment: You can disable all the error messages for improperly quoted attribute values by having HTML Validator ignore and disregard the quotation mark requirements for attribute values. This option is in CSE HTML Validator's Validator Engine Options. However, it is recommended that you leave these error messages enabled and that you properly enclose attribute values in quotation marks.<br><br>51. Comment: You can ignore the nesting errors by turning off the option to check HTML tag nesting. However, it is recommended that you leave this feature enabled. This option is in CSE HTML Validator's Validator Engine Options. <br><br>52. Comment: You can change the maximum number of error messages to display before the validation is terminated.
