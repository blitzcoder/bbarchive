This is now looking to be more complex than I initially thought it would be. Here is the sort of information I need to store for each entity in the game.<br><br>Name<br>Information<br>Class<br>Race<br>Level<br>Health<br>Skill<br>Strength<br>Power<br>Morale<br>Movement Points<br>Initiative<br>Graphics Pointers<br>Sound Pointers<br><br>Each entity will have lists of the following also:<br><br>Inventory<br>Spells Known<br>Status<br>Powers<br>Currently Equipped<br><br>Now, whats the best way of storing all this data? Should I ivestigate Types, Arrays, Mem Banks, Text Files.... <br><br>The game structure is a turn based tiled strategy fest - no fast graphics other than spell effects and small stuff.<br><br><br>Cheers <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

As for how I was gonna' access the stats I was going to use a set of CONSTs as offsets within the array structure, ie.<br><br>strength = entity (id,STAT_STRENGTH)<br><br>Where id is just the id of the creature and STAT_STRENGTH the constant. The only problem with this approach is that all your data has to be of the same type (no doubt integer in an RPG I would think) so things like name$ would have to be dealt with separately. Though in mine the would be a very finite number of names as it was really a wizard against a load of creatures who'd all be "skeleton"'s or "zombie"'s.<br><br>As for how I was going to store the default settings for everything, I was gonna' opt for text files with a parser, just because it's a really nice and readable way to store stuff and you can edit the values very easily that way.<br><br>But that's just me. What do I know? :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

What can an enemy bear, and what not...<br><br>Like this for a Hell-Hound<br><br>Fire - Resistant<br>Water - Weakness<br>Ice - Weakness<br>Earth - Normal<br>Thunder - Normal<br>Holy - Normal<br>Evil - Normal<br><br>And for a zombie you could set holy to weakness, and whatever, and so on... That can really power up... It's not really realistic if you can beat a Fire beast, like a hell-hound or a phoenix with fire, now is it?<br><br>What I also miss is the ammount of experience points... I think that's a vital value...<br><br>I'm also not sure what I should see for "Morale"...<br><br>Another thing is not to come up with too much statistics, they might easily be forgotten... Just like too much equipment... Just be sure only to add what you really need...<br><br>What I also miss it the supporting of status-changes, like Paralyzed, Poisoned etc... A good thing to enter in an RPG y'know...<br><br>As for if you should use types or not... In Blitz better not, but if you want to use them you can better use them in array style... Like if you need 6 players<br><br><pre class=code>
Dim P(6).Player

For Ak=1 to 6
    P(Ak) = New Player
    Next
</pre><br><br>For each is definatly not going to work... (I'm an RPG creator myself, and that's what I know from experience)...<br><br>Array types are easier to track in an RPG especially since you need a value for the "Target"...<br><br>Are you still following me?<br><br><br><br>Another point is... I set up all statistics in an array of three...<br><br>Like this<br>Dim Strength(4,3)  ; First digit, player number, last digit will be explained...<br><br>Then I would define it like this<br><br>Strength(1,1) = The character's strength without weapon<br>Strength(1,2) = How much points has the character's strength been increased by spells<br>Strength(1,3) = Characters strength with spells and equipment<br><br>Very important...<br><br>In fact I also work in my statistics in complete arrays...<br><br>Dim Stat(4,3,10)<br><br>First digit, player number you know, second digit for the adjustments discussed above, and the last one what kind of statistics... Like 1 = Strength, 2 = defense, etc...<br><br>Why this method? Can save you a lot of time...<br><br>For spells I use a semiliar array<br><br>Dim SpellStatAdjust(10)<br><br>In my database I can then very quickly change everything with a four-next loop, while otherwise I have to define every single field... I just love the quick way...<br><br>I do the same for equipment, statuschanges, and lots of things...<br><br>Please remember, I've been programming RPGs for 5 years now, and these methods have really been thought through...<br><br>One warning... Creating an RPG requires more than you can ever imagine... MUCH more...<br><br>You'll require tons of diffrent databases... Like stores, spells, equipment, Experience level gain tables, dungeon information, monster statistics, properties of persons you meet in the game, properties of items...<br><br>Are you sure you still want to go on with this? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Essentially, you can create a relational database with them.  For example:<br><br><pre class=code>
Type PlayerTemplate
   field Name$

   ; Add a player ID number
   field playerID
   field Information$
   field Class$
   field Race$
   field Level 
   field Health 
   field Skill 
   field Strength 
   field Power 
   field Morale 
   field MovementPoints 
   field Initiative 
   field GraphicsPointers 
   field SoundPointers
End Type

Type InventoryList
   field playerID
   
   ; here you can store all of your object info
   ; such as weight, name, damage, abilities, etc..
   ; in an object type that is stored in a separate
   ; list

   field object.ObjectTemplate
End Type

Type SpellList
    field playerID
    field spell.SpellTemplate
End Type

; Essentially you could have a lookup function to return
; a player's inventory or spells

Function GetInventory.InventoryList(someplayersID)
    ; this function will cycle through the inventoryLists
    ; and compare the field playerID with the arguement
    ; someplayersID.. If they match, add the item to a 
    ; return list.  Then, after they're all compared,
    ; return a list holding the player's inventory
End Function
