Don't bother trying to find a way to figure out if peices are in a row without aligning them to a grid...  Then you're getting into artificial intelligence and fuzzy logic. :-)<br><br>To check if there are four in a row, you just start at the first peice, and move across to the right...

Each location in the array was filled with '0' if nobody occupied that location, '1' if player 1 occupied it, and '2' if player 2 occupied it.  Next I wrote a function which looked like the following (doing this from memory):<br><pre class=code>
Function checkWin( player )
  If board(1,1) = player And board(1,2) = player And board(1,3) = player And board(1,4) = player Then Return True
  If board(1,2) = player And board(1,3) = player And board(1,4) = player and board(1,5) = player Then Return True
  ; Continue this for all rows, columns, and diagonals.
  Return False
End Function
</pre><br><br>This worked fine and was faster than using loops.  Then I used this logic in a Alpha-Beta A* algorithm (for the computer AI).  It was way too slow.  I then had to encode the board into bits for each player's locations.  I then 'And'ed the numbers against a set which represented winning lines.  This was VERY fast, but obfuscated.  For example, visualize this 3x3 board for Tic-Tac-Toe:<br><br>O O X<br>O X X<br>X O X<br><br>X's representation would be (001 011 101) in binary or 93 in decimal.  O's representation would be (110 100 010) or 418 in decimal.  The winning positions would be (111 000 000), (000 111 000), (000 000 111), (100 100 100), (010 010 010), (001 001 001), (100 010 001), and (001 010 100).  (In decimal this is 384, 56, 7, 292, 146, 73, 273, and 84.)<br><br>And X's positions with each winning position to see if they match.<br>93 And 384 =  0. Fail.<br>93 And  56 = 24. Fail.<br>93 And   7 =  5. Fail.<br>...<br>93 And  84 = 84. Winner!<br><br>This method is insanely fast, but I only recommend it if you are writing an AI for your Connect4 program.  Of course, you have to modify my example to work with Connect4, but it takes only a little effort. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

All My pieces are on the screen already.  The player is just shooting a type of an item at the others, and if it matches what it hits, then it takes it off the screen, at this time I would also like it to remove any other pieces of this type, that are touching the piece hit by the player, and return the point totals, based on how many matching pieces touching it removes.  No pieces on the screen need to move or slide, just the player shooting from different directions as it moves around the outside edge.<br><br>So I think your first attempt or this one could work also.<br><br>All I have to do is make a function, and pass in the item that the player collided with, x, y coords in the grid layout, and also the number of the item collided with so I can check the other items against that number to look for matches.  ** Also NOTE ** if the player is not the item he hits on the screen, then it will not remove the item, but instead change the player into that item.<br><br>I hope you follow me, if not I can send you a copy of the beta I have done already, and let you play it, then you can see what I am trying to do.  This will all be simplified though, since now I am using 3D Objects, but I am planning on converting to 2D objects to lower the system requirements, and make it easier to add special fx to the game, like particle fx, and rotations and stuff.  <br><br>BTW: ** AD HERE ** I would like to thank everyone on this forum for helping me out, without whom I would have never made this game as far and as good as it is today without you guys!!<br><br>** NOTE ** the nSprite lib is the answer if you need fast 2D displays of bmp fonts, and Hud elements etc..  and the guy whom wrote it, is top notch, I gave him 2 bug reports which he promptly fixed by sending me a function he left out, and in the next version everything will be perfecto', since I have informed him of the last memory de-allocation error problem in nS_FreeAll(), when using bmp font system.<br><br>Again, thank you for your help, I really appreciate it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
