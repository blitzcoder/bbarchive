Since the rooms will be pretty identical in terms of what the player can do in them, you only need one room function which, among other things, displays the description for the current room.  Store descriptions for all the rooms in an array or with types and have the function reference the appropriate description.

The best advice I got when I first started programming games is to start with the easiest project I can think of (I did Minesweeper) and gradually ramp up the difficulty with each project I undertake.  Most people try to write a MMORPG right out of the gate, but the experience and confidence (the latter is definitely overlooked a lot) you gain from starting on easier projects will make things much easier for you on harder projects.  Anyone can start a game but only a rare few can finish one, and that finishing ability is only gained from having completed games in the past.  And if you've never programmed a game before you are MUCH more likely to complete something easy than something hard.<br><br>My recommendation if you are finding this project too difficult is make it easier.  Cut down the number of items and rooms in your game until it is something you can easily finish.  Then finish it, and start a new project which is a bit harder.  Above all else, do NOT switch to a new project until this one is done.  There are of course legitamite reasons for abandoning a project to work on something else, but when you are just starting out you want to build up the habit of finishing what you start.<br><br>In fact, a logical small increase in difficulty for your next project would be adding some graphics.  Complete this project without graphics, and then do Space Invaders for your next project. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Suppose your game has 500 or so locations.  Set up the player's inventory to be 600 (for example) and all non-player characters to have successesive numbers.<br><br>When legally taking a object, change it's location value to 600 (or whatever).  When you do a inventory check - you search through the entire list of objects and display all those where the object location is equal to 600 (or whatever) - when dropping an object change the object location to the location number.  Also, you can make other objects have inventories in the same way - such as a backpacks or chests - whatever you like.  Backpack 1 could have location number 700 - the sky is the limit.<br><br>Actually, what you are doing is fairly easy - it's just you haven't yet made the connections - you will.<br><br>Note:<br>You don't need to use restore for this.<br><br>I wouldn't store location descriptions in arrays - keep that stuff as data. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

</pre><br><br>The room/area/class/race number, and player Id is because I'm doing arrays in types.  I'm dimming player by 1,000 for now, and then reorganizing them when someone quits, eventually i may change it so that there can be unlimited players but it'll have to store each player in a temporary field, besides you can set dim p.player(1000000) if you have the memory, etc.  I also have to clean it up and make it look better, and comm,comm1$,etc is going to be changed to pc.command_buffer(cbuff for short) so that it'll store up to ten commands, but anyways, thats my list.
