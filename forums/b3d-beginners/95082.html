While I admire your intensity, I can't help but wonder if such a wide variety of programming topics is a good thing?<br><br>In order words, if I was trying to learn word wrapping, bezier waypoints, data storage and manipulation, physics engines, "recording" systems, random position generation while excluding certain areas, 3D Text Systems, timers, entity and line picking, special effects like splashing water, and even SQL databases, all within about two weeks time, I would be worn out (and if you noticed, all of these examples listed come from posts you've submitted within the last two weeks.)<br><br>I don't mind helping you, and I know there's a tone of people on this site who are eager to help you too, but my advice going forward would be to use your intensity towards mastering a single concept, rather than spreading yourself thin with trying to do it all at once.<br><br>That being said, here's an exercise for you regarding this last question: using the native Blitz commands for strings, such as Len(), Left(), Mid(), Right(), ect., I want you to come up with a demo on how to make a word wrapping system. Don't worry about implementing this into your game yet, that's too complex. You can do that later. For now, just focus on being able to post some code here which can run by itself, no extra media required. This demo should include:<br><br>1. A texting system, where when the line reaches either the end of the screen or the end of a space you've defined, the text will word-wrap onto the next line. This can be done entirely with Blitz, and I know this because I have a system like that myself that I wrote not that long ago.<br><br>2. An easy to implement system. What this means is that I want the majority of this program to be contained within a single function, and, if possible, don't use any global variables. If you do this right, the only thing that other programmers would have to do is copy and paste this function into their game, make a string at some point, and call this function to make it word wrap.<br><br>I know that you've got the stuff to do this yourself, and if you're up for the challenge, take a stab at it. If you need help getting started, let me know and I'll give you some pseudo for layout or help you with the tough problems. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I FINALLY accepted the fact that I just didn't have what it took and I moved on.  Life is better without the constant stream of code running through my head.

If it's a pride thing then you are going about real life the wrong way.  Maybe try 3D modeling, texture work, sfx, music...there are so many other things to do besides code.  There are plenty of coders out there (some would say too many).  I see you holding back frustration in every post.

I can guarantee you that there is no programmer out there who was able to learning everything they know overnight. I've been a hobbyist programmer for over 7 years now, and I still don't feel confident enough with my skills to try a harder language, like C++ and whatnot. We all had to start somewhere, and the best way this forum can help you is if you're willing to learn from the beginning. Ideally, when you look through the forum, you should be able to look at someone else's code and have a general sense of what the outcome will be. When you hit that point, that's when these forums are going to have the biggest impact on you. Before that point, I doubt they serve a purpose, because what we will suggest will be too complicated if you don't understand the basics.<br><br>Don't let this discourage you. Instead of trying to learn it all at once, how about taking a very slow pace and getting to know 2D programming like the back of your hand? Do like Ginger Tea suggests, and look at the old school games and see how they were made. Maneesh Sethi's "Game Programming for Teens" does that very thing, starting with being able to print "Hello World" and moving all the way up to designing a space invaders game. Yes, it's all in 2D and may not be the most exciting game you've ever played, but doing this will lay down the groundwork for you to move on to bigger and better games.<br><br>And, if you still don't feel like you understand programming, then look into design. I am a horrific designer. I kid you not, I think I can maybe make a sphere in Milkshape and, on a good day, I can texture it. So, I quickly learned that design and modelling was not my forte. But that's OK, because I found other aspects to game design that I was good at.<br><br>To answer your question about timers, I would certainly NOT consider adding a timer to your code above until you were positive the word wrapper did exactly what it should be doing. Right now, the code you have isn't a word wrapper, but more or less a text scroller, increasing the letters being texted in every loop. Only, you don't see the result because Blitz cycles through all of them with the For...Next loop without flipping. But to use a timer for anything (which I assume you mean a Millisecond timer, not an actual timer like CreateTimer()), you simply create a variable, store Millisecs() to it when you want to start timing, then compare the new Millisecs() value to the stored variable and the actual time you want to pass. Code could look like:<br><pre class=code>
time = Millisecs()

While Not KeyDown(1)

   If Millisecs() &gt;= time + 1000 ;1 second has passed
      Print "More than 1 second has passed"
   EndIf

Wend
</pre><br><br>This is useful to control the timing of your game, but like I said before, this isn't related to word wrapping, and don't use text scrolling until you've got the word wrapping down. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's one of the few books out there that both teaches programming in general, rather than how to use a given language, while also keeping the hard maths to a minimum so as to stay accessible to the general reader.<br><br>That's not to say it's an easy book. It used to be the intro textbook for the Computer Science course at MIT. There was a high dropout rate. But perhaps this will appeal to your sense of competition and determination.<br><br>You'll also note: the book uses a language <i>wildly</i> different from Blitz. This is good: it means you have to learn principles for real, and absolutely cannot simply try to pick up code snippets without understanding them. And it won't teach you anything at all about game design, which is a completely separate topic that technically doesn't even have to involve programming. Again, this is good, because it means focus.<br><br>The book is quite long, and might be a little daunting. If you complete even the first section ("Building Abstractions with Procedures") and understand it properly (can't emphasize enough: <i>do all the exercises!</i>), you'd already be an above-average programmer (that's only ~85 pages out of ~600!).<br><br><br>The compiler they recommend to do the exercises with is a bit difficult to setup and use: <a href="http://sisc-scheme.org/sisc-online.php" target="_blank">SISC</a> provides exactly the same language and you can use it right in your browser. <a href="http://dynamo.iro.umontreal.ca/~gambit/wiki/index.php/Main_Page" target="_blank">Gambit</a> is another good one when you need a downloadable version (handy once you start writing longer pieces and want to save your files).<br><br><br>Are you tough enough?<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
