Without these early shooters much of what we love about the PC industry may have never happened.<br>My facination with these games grew into more than simply a collection but an obession as time progressed. I always wanted to try and make my own shooter, one that could have possibly hit the shelves in the mid to late 90's and could have competed with maybe even Duke3d and Doom? After messing around with making maps and simple mods for titles like Wolf3d, Rise of the Triad, and Doom it left satsified me for awhile but still hungry for more.<br><br>Now once again for fun I want to try and create a basic raycast like engine from scratch. What I mean by "raycast like" is that the engine will not use archaic algorithms or overly rely on 2d sprites. The game world will be 3d but be carefully designed to feel like a oldschool corridor shooter. This way I have none of the limiations or pain of working with antiquated game design techniques.<br><br>Even if my game map is showing 5000 polygons or more each map is only created from the following few models.<br><br>MAP LEGEND<br><img src="http://i50.tinypic.com/2v0cpsj.png"><br><br>I'm not exactly sure how a cpu and gpu process 3d information, but to me this seems like a logical way to keep the memory requirements low. <br><br>My plan is to draw the map information by storing everything in an array.<br><br>0,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,0<br>0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0<br>0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0<br>1,1,1,1,3,3,3,1,1,1<br><br>Let's say that 0 = the floor model and that 1 = the standard wall.<br>2 is actually the same model as 1 but with a different texture.<br>3 might be the same wall with yet a new texture but the orientation might be inverted.<br><br>Following me still? :)<br><br>I have a basic framework coded so far that allows the player to move around a map, change the lighting, and checkout a few assets I modeled but nothing more.

I can easily model a small complex, texture each piece, then manually add each section into blitz3d. But I want a faster way to come up with simple levels using code.<br><br>Currently I create everything in Maya using the grid with snap on.

Maps can look 'samey' and uninteresting.<br><br>2) Write your own map editor. There are several ways to do this but one possible way would be to create map sections out of meshes and simply adapt the game code you have so far so that you can literally run round the game world placing the desired map section into the 'cell' in front of you as you go. When finished just save map to a custom map file.<br><br>Pro's - Re-use of game code you already have means you can knock up a simple map editor like this fairly quickly. Just add some form of map tile selection and a way of being able to load/save your work and you're practically done.<br>Cons - A restricted 1st person view like the method above means that it could be difficult to visualize the overall layout of your map so far. You could provide alternative top-down views and/or a mini-map of the current floor level you are working on.<br><br>3) Use a 3rd party 2d tile map editor. In this case you're designing your map 1 floor level at a time placing 2d tiles that represent your 3d map tiles.<br><br>Pro's - No extra coding required other than loading in floor data into an array then generating the complete map from a 3d tile set.<br><br>Cons - Designing a multi-floor map with a 2d map editor one floor at a time can make it difficult to visualize how those floors 'connect' with each other. For instance a lift shaft or even a wall might not be aligned correctly with those on the floor level either above or below it.<br><br>Another possible way you could generate your maps (but again on a floor by floor basis) is to pick a colour to represent each tile type and simply use any art package to draw the floor layout into a bitmap sized to your map world then load in the bitmap and reconstruct your map from there.<br><br>I'm out of ideas now but I hope there's enough there for you to think about. I hope you knock up something soon I'd be interested in seeing something playable :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In a normal game engine, information flows "one way" through various layers. Collision data comes out of the collision system, informs the AI, which is then rendered using renderables. B3D encourages users to simplify the process, but in so doing creates vastly over complicated collision scenes by building them out of render mesh data (usually, far too many polygons and unneeded details).<br><br>i.e. you usually should definitely not using your renderable meshes for collision purposes anyway if you care about performance.<br><br>In your case, the grid layout again provides you with a huge advantage.

I think my ancient Pent3 with a 32mb diamond viper can easily do 20,000 polys. I'm gonna dig that thing out and test it today! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

They're incredibly slow. If you're colliding moving characters against the level, consider the possibility of representing the level as a collection of boxes and using sphere-box collision instead of sphere-mesh: it will be faster if you can arrange the boxes efficiently.<br><br>2) If you have to use mesh collisions, consider using <a href="http://telias.free.fr/3d_blitz3d.html" target="_blank">ColDet</a> for collision instead of the builtin collision system. It's hundreds of times faster, and also offers mesh-mesh collision detection (which is <i>still</i> faster than the builtin collision engine). You could also use OPCODE or a full physics engine like ODE or Newton (yes, even these will be dramatically faster), but ColDet has the advantage of being a popular and tested B3D solution.<br><br>"Optimising" B3D collisions is a waste of time, the core collision engine is simply too slow for high-performance use, and they are more easily replaced with an alternative engine. On the other hand, optimising thing that aren't bottlenecks <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law" target="_blank">is a waste of <i>your</i> time</a>, so tread carefully.<br><br>Given that your game look to have blocky architecture, you could probably knock together non-collision-based solution that simply keeps players in their blocks and doesn't allow movement elsewhere; this would obviously be the fastest of all, if the level design allows for it (e.g. if your players can't jump, there is no reason to apply gravity and therefore no need for the floor to be solid). The best collision solution is to not use collision if you can possibly avoid doing so. (In fact you could extend this to pretty much everything.) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I do need gravity because players can duck, jump, and even roll. Here is an explanation of what I have going on so far.<br><br><img src="http://nostalgicalgorithms.com/images/ao/maptech1.png"><br>1. I make the map in a 3d program like Maya or 3dsmax.<br><br><img src="http://nostalgicalgorithms.com/images/ao/maptech2.png"><br>2. Polygons with different textures are exported as separate meshes. I decided to do it this way because it allowed be to build the maps visually and I saw no performance difference drawing them with code. Maps are loaded in multiple sections but basically its one giant piece. This seems like a waste of geometry at first but I had concerns about the lighting and getting the textures to tile correctly. Creating the maps like this allows me to mimic maps from Aliens Online down to the smallest detail.<br><br><img src="http://nostalgicalgorithms.com/images/ao/maptech3.png"><br>3. Here I'm selecting one of the many texture layers. I can turn off the walls, floors, grate texture, or whatever else I want to view. Pieces actually start out as cubes but I trim off the extra faces one everything is snapped into place perfectly. Another reason for doing the maps with all these faces is so the lighting behaves correctly. (see below)<br><br><img src="http://nostalgicalgorithms.com/images/ao/ingame_1.png"><br>4. First in game shot without lighting. As you can see the map loads in identically as it appears in Maya. Every piece shares the same collision code.<br><br><br><img src="http://nostalgicalgorithms.com/images/ao/ingame_2.png"><br>5. Triggering the nifty wireframe mode allows you to see the in game polycount. The demo map is so far 1500 polygons but the world only draws a maximum of a 100 for distance. Anything beyond that is not rendered.<br><br><img src="http://nostalgicalgorithms.com/images/ao/ingame_3.png"><br>6. Another angle of the outside area in wireframe mode. The texture wraps around and tiles with the polygon perfectly.  The original Aliens Online had true 3d levels made up of cubes. Possibly using BSP? I'm not sure though.<br><br><img src="http://nostalgicalgorithms.com/images/ao/aor_smoothlight.png"><br>7. Here I'm trying to achieve a shoulder lamp type effect. The lighting here is smooth. The problem is that it only follows the players horizontal movements and not the pitch up and down.<br><br><img src="http://nostalgicalgorithms.com/images/ao/aor_hardlight.png"><br>8. Same as above but with hard lighting instead. If I rotate it 90 degrees and above the players head is matches almost exactly how the shoulder light behaved in Aliens Online. It wasn't very realistic instead surrounding the player with a small circle of light. I'm not sure if I will make the light realistic or leave it as it appeared originally. I know the flashlight affect is not dramatic enough but when I was messing with the lighting I was using a CRT so it looked dark enough.<br><br>If I understand what you're getting at Yasha is that I should simply the geometry even further? Those rooms could be trimmed down more thus reducing the current polygon load in half. But I wanted to make sure the textures scaled correctly without messing with the UV coordinates for each room. I think Blitz3d has enough power to spare with the extra polygons. Everything in my project except for the level will be made up of sprites. However I do feel its still very important to make the code as fast as possible to eliminate any potential lag or strange glitches regarding collisions or gravity. Over analyzing and over optimizing is kind my habit, but I agree I shouldn't waste time on gaining a 1% difference when I so much more still to do. :D<br><br>My geometry abuse is nowhere near anything like this.<br><img src="http://i44.tinypic.com/v4xpw0.jpg"> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This would not affect UVs - an important thing to remember is that there is no need or even reason to use the same mesh for drawing and for collision. The meshes you have now can coexist with a simplified, invisible mesh in the same space that has collision activated. This doesn't have any negative performance effect since as one mesh goes only to the renderer, and one goes only to the updater, there are no redundant operations.<br><br>Using two meshes - one simplified, one visible - is a standard technique used by most games. It is actually a general guideline that you should never use render geometry for collisions, because even at best it's optimised all wrong (as you observed, it has to have UVs for a start). Render meshes need lots of small even polygons for decent texture and lighting; collision meshes need big polygons to minimise the number of checks and seams, and maximise contact area. A clever engine can often generate the collider at load-time so you don't need to do this in your editor. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You don't need to simplify everything: I was just noticing your huge grids of squares that make up floors and walls - you could have the simplification pass be as simple a matter as detecting four identical quads next to each other and unifying them into a single quad; two or three passes of this will dramatically simplify your collider mesh, taking out only the guaranteed-redundant polygons. (How you would detect the presence of quads depends on the structure of your level data.) e.g.:<br><br><img src="http://img841.imageshack.us/img841/5421/qmfp.png"><br><br>The wireframe on the right has the exact same physical shape as that on the left, but with fewer polys. You can see that a lot of obvious (to a human) optimisations aren't made: this doesn't matter - by only choosing the most obviously guaranteed to work (in this case, choosing squares of side 2^n), it stays simple for a machine to do.<br><br>There's no penalty for doing this (except a slightly slower load-time), since as I said above, each mesh is only used by one of the two B3D engine components; even if you didn't simplify the mesh at all it wouldn't actually be slower at runtime, so there is no performance loss to adding a "speculative", conservative simplification pass.<br><br><br>...anyway. This is <i>an</i> optimisation that you can apply at load-time. You obviously don't have to and I don't mean to derail the thread.

Some of these assets will get tweaked and reused. Unless fans of Aliens Online come out of the shadows and demand this to be finished it's being put to the side for now. At this point it's been a real toss up between rebuilding the original game or taking the basic concept and modernizing it a bit. Who knows what I will do in the future? :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Early on testing this FPS idea I did no optimizing, I was more focused on getting everything working. Later on I trimmed out all the extra unseen faces on the level meshes.<br><br>Some of those grates could be done with textures but I have a bad habit of trying to model every little detail in 3D. Blitz3d can actually push a fair bit of polygons long as you're sensitive to the draw/rendering distance. Later on for these Aliens Online maps I went back and created a collision box for every room using minimal geometry as suggested. It all works very well but any aliens themed projects like this are always risky.<br><br>On your own thread you should post some screenshots Mikorians. I'm interested to know more about your project. In between working on my ambitions Battlezone 2 inspired project I may churn out a simple 90's FPS similar to Wolfenstein or Corridor 7. I grew up with those games and always wanted to make my own classic corridor shooter. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
