I was testing out a few of my own recipes for gravity and jumping and have gotton myself into a complete mesh here. The object is supposed to jump in the air and float back down really quick like when the spacekey is hit once only. The only problem is that the player remains floating in the air until I release the cursor keys which are up and down. I feel that my problem lies within this small piece of my code and I absolutely cannot figure out what my problem is. Below is that small snippet that I had mentioned before: <br><pre class=code>

        x#=0
	y#=0
	z#=0
	
	
	If KeyDown(208)=True Then y#=-.1
	If KeyDown(200)=True Then y#=.1
	If KeyHit(57)=True Then y#=5.0
	MoveEntity sphere,0,y#,0
        TranslateEntity sphere,0,-0.1,0
    
</pre><br>This small code is located at the end of my program right before UpdateWorld and everything else.<br><br>Again I mention that I was trying to make the object jump when the spacekey is hit and not be able to jump again until he floats back down. He was/is supposed to NOT be floating but move forward while jumping and again float down. If anyone here could be so kind as to show me the correct way to set this up would be greatly appreciated. :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That would be really cool, but gravity doesn't actually work like that.<br><br>Instead, the ball gradually picks up speed until 1 of 2 things happen:<br><br>1. The ball smashes into the face of the Earth, in which all downward energy is transferred into the Earth and the sphere stops moving.<br>2. The ball hits terminal velocity, in which the amount of force the air exerts on the ball from downward movement evens out the amount of force gravity exerts on the ball, therefore the ball stops accelerating at a very high speed. Then, the ball will come smashing into the face of the Earth.<br><br>Try to program your gravity to do the same thing. Start with some very simple pseudo:<br><pre class=code>
;Setup a constant for gravity
;Setup a Global variable to store the current downward movement.

;Setup a collisions system to let Blitz know about the ground and the player

;The Main Loop Here

   ;If the player is not touching the ground
      ;Increase the Global downward movement by the constant of gravity
      ;If the downward movement is greater than "terminal velocity"
         ;the downward movement should now become "terminal velocity"
      ;End of that If section
   ;End of that If section

   ;If the player is touching the ground
      ;Reset the downward movement back to the starting constant
   ;End of that If section

   ;Move the player downward according to the current downward movement

;Do it all  again

For example, in the U.S.A., 3D math uses a different axis system, and if memory serves me well, Y and Z are reversed from what Blitz uses. That's the United States for you, though. We're backwards with everything (cars, math, temperature, distance measurement).<br><br>Anyways, here's the problem:<br><pre class=code>
MoveEntity sphere,0,y#,0
</pre><br>This should become:<br><pre class=code>
MoveEntity sphere,0,0,z#
</pre><br>Don't forget to change your variable y# to z#. Also, you don't have to use a variable in this situation, but it's completely up to you. You could just as easily type:<br><pre class=code>
If KeyDown(208)=True Then MoveEntity sphere,0,0,-0.1
</pre><br>Before, you would be moving your sphere on the Y-axis (up and down), and you wanted to move it on the Z-axis (forward and backward).<br><br>If you are ever in doubt about how the movement works, remember that the alpha-bet order goes X,Y,Z, and Blitz works the same way. X-axis first (left and right), Y-axis next (up and down), and finally the Z-axis last (forward and backward).<br><br><br><br>Now, DebugLog....This is perhaps one of the most useful tools that Blitz has come up with. DebugLog will dump information to a log while the game is running. This is useful because even if you try to text the variable values on screen, it can be hard to read because even a slow game will still have about 15 frames a second, which is much too fast to be able to read and process. In reality, most games shoot for either 30 frames a second or 60 frames a second, so it's hard to know the internal process of Blitz. For example, consider:<br><pre class=code>
Graphics3D 640,480,0,2

SetBuffer BackBuffer()

Global number# = 1.0

While Not KeyDown(1)

   number# = number# - 0.1
   If number# = 0.1
      Cls
      Text 0,0,"This sentence will never be read"
      Flip
      WaitKey()
      End
   EndIf

   Text 0,0,number#

   Flip

Wend

End
</pre><br>This program will take away 0.1 from "number#". Logically, the numbers would read every loop:<br>1.0<br>0.9<br>0.8<br>0.7<br>0.6<br>0.5<br>0.4<br>0.3<br>0.2<br>0.1<br>0.0<br>Based on the sample program I typed in, when "number#" is 0.1, the program should stop everything, text on the screen "This sentence will never be read", wait for you to push a key, and then end the program. HOWEVER, the way it is set up, this will never happen. The reason why is because floating point numbers in computers happen to be unable to represent 0.1 perfectly when they are obtained through math (taking away 0.1 each loop).<br><br>If you didn't know this, which I didn't when I first stared programming, then you will run into trouble when you check if "number#" = 0.1. So, the program doesn't do what you want it to do. You know you've typed everything right, the logic makes sense, and you have no idea why it isn't working. At this point, the best thing you can do it DebugLog the values of "number#", and then see where the problem is. So, taking the above example, let's add in a DebugLog command to know what's really happening under the hood:<br><pre class=code>
Graphics3D 640,480,0,2

SetBuffer BackBuffer()

Global number# = 1.0

While Not KeyDown(1)

   number# = number# - 0.1

   DebugLog number# ;Here's the new command we added. Run in Debug Mode

   If number# = 0.1
      Cls
      Text 0,0,"This sentence will never be read"
      Flip
      WaitKey()
      End
   EndIf

   Text 0,0,number#

   Flip

Wend

End
</pre><br>With DebugLog added, if we run our program in Debug Mode, Blitz is now going to text the value of "number#" each loop to the screen that appears behind the program. At any time, we can click and hold the left mouse button on the debug log and scroll through the values to see if there are any glitches in the values that shouldn't be there. If you ran this program, you would see the following values appear in the Debug Log:<br>1.0<br>0.9<br>0.8<br>0.7<br>0.6<br>0.5<br>0.4<br>0.3<br>0.2<br>0.0999999<br>-0.0000000745058<br>For speed reasons, Blitz uses numbers that are very close to 0.1 and 0.0, but they still aren't perfectly equal to 0.1 or 0.0. Because of this, with the line of code:<br><pre class=code>
If number# = 0.1
</pre><br>The following If section will never be executed because 0.0999999 is never going to be equal to 0.1, making a huge problem with the game. Without DebugLog, you might never know why the problem was there, because 0.0999999 would flash by so fast on the screen that you wouldn't even have time to see it. Using DebugLog, you now know that the values aren't perfect, and you need to adjust your code accordingly. To do so, I would simply change this line:<br><pre class=code>
If number# = 0.1
</pre><br>To this line:<br><pre class=code>
If number# &lt;= 0.1 And number# &gt;= 0.09
</pre><br>And the game will now do what it was originally intended to do.<br><br>This turned into a much lengthier explanation than I intended, but to sum it all up, keep these things in mind:<br><br>X-axis - Left and Right<br>Y-axis - Up and Down<br>Z-axis - Forward and Backward (into the screen)<br><br>Pitch - Rotation on the X-axis<br>Yaw - Rotation on the Y-axis<br>Roll - Rotation on the Z-axis<br><br>DebugLog - Use this command to Write variable values to a temporary file to see what they are every loop, or the "under the hood" stuff.<br><br>Hopefully, this all makes sense. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
