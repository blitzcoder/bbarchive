We were just wondering how we are going to go about using blender for our animation &amp; texturing needs.<br><br>If anyone could offer some insight, I would greatly appreciate it, and thanks to everyone for taking time out to help out a fellow blitzer! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

An attempt to keep it simple ig. I plan on eventually moving up to a paid game engine, or use BMax with a good engine, but for now Blitz3d and its familiarity is a good way to re-imerse myself into game design.<br><br>- again I appreciate everyone's support, the blitz forums have always been amazingly helpful<br>, cheers! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

While opinions are welcome it's not the tools that make the game. Its what the developer does with those tools that really matters. Sometimes people don't have the time, money, or a modern enough machine to support moving to a newer language or set of tools.<br><br>You got to ask yourself this what will moving over to something like the UDK or Untity bring to your project? I hate it when I see very simple games using bloom lighting and fancy effects for no other reason that they can. If you goal is simplicity then I see no problems sticking with Blitz3d.<br><br>For example:<br>If Markus Persson said to any big company "I want to make a multiplayer game filled with millions of blocks and program it in Java" he would have been laughed out of the office. He has made millions with minecraft despite how horrible Java is for creating a game. (I can't play minecrat without optifine.) If your end product is fun and polished to a certain degree your users won't care what you programed it in.<br><br>So is Blitz3d old? Yes. Does is still work? Yes. I really dislike the logic that just because something is old you shouldn't use it. This is why I ultimately gave up on supporting any development tools by Microsoft. Whenever something new comes out it pretty much depreciates all your old work and often makes it incompatible with newer releases. While in school I did some programing in the MFC and it was hell. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Blitz3D is stable, still has an active community for support and is still on sale.  <br></div><br><br>Why the lack of candor in quoting out of context?  Apparently, you disagree with me that B3D is the better of the two.  I have already outlined why I think B3D is better than Xors3D, the active community providing help, being the reason.  Perhaps you can explain why you think Xors3D is a better product than B3D? <br><br>If B3D does not meet the needs of somebody, I strongly suggest looking at BlitzMax and miniB3D, but Max and Xors3D would not be recommended.  Xors3D is dead, deprecated, unsupported and buggy, which, ironically, <b>are</b> the main reasons most people give for using something else instead of B3D. <br><br>As to the state of B3D, <b>you</b> said it best three years ago in a discussion about a conflict on an Intel GPU.  The bolding is mine, nothing is out of context as I quoted the whole paragraph:<br><br><i>The fact Blitz is failing to perform in a more restricted environment simply points to the fact <b>Blitz3D has never IMHO been a fully compliant DirectX7 design</b> and given the ability to reproduce Mark will fix another assumption he has made regarding state of 1 of 7300 caps that could be tested in the course of providing compatability.</i><br><br>DirectX7 is a deprecated API. When something is built on a legacy API and was never fully compliant (your words, not mine) with that API, then there are issues that will arise.  At least with B3D, as I have stated before, there are people in the community to help with with any workarounds if you encounter a problem.  You will <b>NOT</b> find that support with Xors3D.<br><br>Had the issues in Blitz3D SDK been fixed (instead of yanking the product), and perhaps the audio portion removed (where many of the issues seemed to be), people who wanted a syntactically better language than B3D would be able to use BlitzMax and the tried and true engine they love.  Instead those wanting 3D are either leaving for products like Unity (which is horrid) or trying to use third-party engines like Xors3D which inevitably implode as soon as the product gains momentum and tech support issues start flooding the developers who then get overwhelmed and abandon ship.  <br><br>BlitzMax still has a LOT of life in it.  I strongly recommend BlitzMax and miniB3D or Blitz3D over Xors3D any day.  YMMV. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
