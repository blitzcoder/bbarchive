Besides that, let me try to summarize what you said: I should make a tiny world to test out all the functions I want the game to do, like moving from area to area and all that stuff, right? And in this world, you want me to create at least one of each type of object and npc, and test them in this world to see if they work right?

This kind of project brings you a real chicken and egg situation... should the content be design-led (ie you know what gameplay elements you want and will code and code and code until you either get them implemented or die trying) or should it be technology-led (ie you curtail your artistic vision to fit within the constraints you absolutely know you can achieve). For me it's a no-brainer... if you can't code "it" within a reasonable time frame then you can't do "it", can't have "it" and should forget about "it". So I'm sugesting that you spend a little time exploring how you might implement the most fundamental systems of this kind of game, because then you'll at least have a basis for a design.<br><br>You should be prepared, also, for the possibility that your first four or five attempts at this aren't going to go particularly well.

I have some ideas, but what is the way you do that?<br> <br></div><br>Off the top of my head - in the main game loop check to see if the player has entered (ie is within a certain distance of) a portal and, if so, whizz off to a function that checks which map the portal leads to and loads it in place of the current one. Before returning, the function would also check to see where the portal places the player on the new map and which portal(s)/enemies/npc's/objects/etc belong to this map so it can place all of them, too.<br><br><div class="quote"> <br>One more thing (although there is sure to be more later) If I want to make an inventory, is that just like an array of types?

Were I writing a Zelda-type adventure, however, I might decide to finally learn how they work, because they might be highly advantageous in such a context and I wouldn't want to disadvantage myself. You're probably best advised to check out the blitzcoder.com showcases, look for a game with a similar remit and quiz the author directly (hoping they're not too grumpy).
