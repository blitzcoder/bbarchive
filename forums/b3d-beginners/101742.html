For me it's all about this one game, a retro remake of MicroProse F-19/F-117, which will always be my #1 passion. Forever freeware and when I get far enough along, open source. The same will go for any other flight sim remakes I might attempt in the future.<br><br>But if I actually pull off my dream game and find that I enjoyed making it, I might try commercial indie development. I'd have to come up with original ideas and once again deal with the hassles of a "business", but I'm not ruling out the possibility...years down the road.<br><br>But for now I just want to learn, have fun and like you said, not have to worry about "copyrighted references". I'm almost 100% certain that I won't have issues with my F-19 freeware fan game as I stay in contact with some ex-MicroProse ('90s) and I know they're rooting for me. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'm 46 and in tri-focals and my vision isn't as sharp as it used to be.

The author Martin Kenwright (founder of DID) is a pilot and I think it shows. And this is what I'm aiming for, although I still want to be able to use my lesser Logitech Wingman sticks.<br><br>The xfighter Blitz3D demo is what won me over, no other game maker had such a complete and easy to understand "flight sim" sample. And B3D was the last one I tried, I was lucky to even find out about it, it's usually not listed as a suggested starting point. Suddenly I started believing, "I CAN DO THIS!" B3D made the whole idea seem possible. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
