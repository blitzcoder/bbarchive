It may be a huge milestone or a tiny function.

There is nothing worse than having to read through your code, to see where abouts you are in terms of progress. Give variables useful names too, and the same with functions.<br><br>Don't make your functions too long. Someone once told me, you should keep each function no longer than a page in the IDE. Anything bigger, than split it down more. So it's more like a list of processes, rather than lines and lines of code.<br><br>For instance:<br><br><pre class=code>

If KeyDown(203) Then ; if LEFT key

   Move_character_left()

End if
</pre><br><br>Rather than putting in lines of code to make the character move left. It leave it cleaner and easier to pick up, and to debug. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'm gonna be honest with you.<br><br>Firstly, competition. Being able to get that "I made something better than you" feeling. You also have a little suspense right before posting your work, hoping people will like it; it's a nice feeling, kinda.<br>Secondly, it's the thrill to show your <i>good</i> work to others (which in turn makes me want to be able to make the best graphics myself, the best sprites, etc. and that pushes me towards self-improvement in the skill department). I don't like posting things for critique, even if I may say so in the post or whatever. If I post something, it's because I want to hear "wow, very good". <br>EDIT: Don't take it like I'm an arrogant prick. If a person took the time to say "very good", then I'll surely take the time to say "thank you!".<br><br>That is what motivates me.<br><br>Stopping a project and then getting back to it doesn't really work for me. I prepare my mindset or whatever and just focus that project. If I go to work on something else, I'll start wanting to do other things, and will stop caring about the one I was doing. Also, if the thing isn't interesting me or is beyond my level of skill (meaning, I hit a roadblock), I start to give up on the project. <br>I can only get interested for a problem if it's in my level of skill (or just slightly beyond it) to find a fix\bypass for it. <br>That is why you should practice a lot so that you encounter less problems in your game, and for those you encounter, then at least you can improve your skill while trying to solve them. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
