Even the ones with examples could always benifit from another example. <br>I don't think anyone ever thought of this before, because I haven't noticed even one example code posted there. <br><br>PS. I am not a beginner programer, I posted this because I see a need in the Blitz community.  <br>I'm not an expert either and I have noticed commands that I have trouble with too. <br>And it would be awsome to just click on the link at the bottom of the command reference and get an example. <br>Instead of searching the forums for an hour. <br>Again, Thanks for all your help! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
