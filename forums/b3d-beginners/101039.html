But when it comes to development and gaming, I'm old-school.<br><br>My software is old...<br><br><img src="http://198.65.10.229/DID/Temp/DSCF1868.JPG"><br><br><br>My reference books are old...<br><br><img src="http://198.65.10.229/DID/Temp/RFS/MG02.JPG"><br><br><br>And the games I play and want to develop are old (i.e. EF2000 DOS...1994/95)...<br><br><img src="http://198.65.10.229/DID/Temp/ef2k-1.jpeg"><br><br><img src="http://198.65.10.229/DID/Temp/ef2k-6.jpeg"><br><br><img src="http://198.65.10.229/DID/Temp/ef2klockon.jpeg"><br><br><img src="http://198.65.10.229/DID/Temp/tc2.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://198.65.10.229/DID/Temp/planner.png"><br><br><img src="http://198.65.10.229/DID/Temp/airbase.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://198.65.10.229/DID/Temp/oob_dtl.jpg"><br><br><br>So B3D seems perfect for me!<br><br>++++++++++<br><br>But my theory why B3D is having such success with flight sims is:<br><br>1. A B3D developer is obviously not making realistic cutting-edge graphics a top priority, giving precious developing time to other things like physics and game-play.<br><br>2. A B3D developer isn't concerned with, nor is chasing new technologies, focusing solely on developing their game with what they have NOW.<br><br>Because no one is going to develop a fully-featured flight sim (especially one with modern combat) in just a few short months. By the time you finish your game, whatever tools/technology you started with are likely going to be outdated anyway. With B3D you don't even worry about it, B3D today is going to be the same B3D tomorrow and the same in 5 years, so your learning curve stays consistent while you just jeep plugging away at your game.<br><br>Like my development OS (Windows 2000) and all of my tools that support it, Blitz3D is small, fast, very reliable and never needs to phone home (my development PC is not online connected). That's about the best I can ask  from a 3D engine, even if DirectX 7 graphics are overkill for my needs.<br><br>++++++++++<br><br>I started this thread as a reminder that not all B3D users spend time on these boards, although I plan to when I feel ready and with something meaningful to contribute. The first video in my original post above of the modern combat flight sim is just one example of a B3D developer who I don't believe has ever posted here (possibly doesn't speak English). And I'm sure there are others, B3D lives on! :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The picture above is actually highly comparable to Blitz3d. The keys are finger sized, the basic colors and shapes are non threatening, and the whole thing is really quite pleasing to look at and to use. You could even compare the nice old table under it to Blitz3d, but I'll stop there. The point is, I've been telling people about Blitz3d for years, always with the same basic description: "It's between Playstation 1 and Playstation 2 quality. No black fog, but no shiny armor either, which who cares, right?" The bottom line is, games get better the further back in time you go, and more realistic the further forward.

I'm not a professional coder, but from what I hear. Developers sometime start a project with the latest hardware, then work just with that hardware and nothing else until the project is complete.
