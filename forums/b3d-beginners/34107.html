Also, it does load and display the wall cubes correctly using the texture inside the model I originally exported, what is not working is applying the texture to the entity, and yes I know it has the texture named correctly and yes it appears to be loading the texture, but for some reason when using entitytexture it is not getting applied.  I have checked the texturename using text yada yada inside the main loop to see that the textures well at least the last one are getting loaded tfilename$ prints the fullpath and texturename perfectly on the screen, and Blitz3D visual blitz with debug on, does not give me any errors about missing texture or anything like that, I was getting that before I changed the texture names, on the png files.  Could it be possible that when I exported the png files from imageforge and it wanted to use the papercolor as transparency info, that it made the texture in essence blank ?  Then I thought about this, and opened image forge re-opened each texture and did a save as on each one to resave them as cube*.tga the * being the number from 0-4.  Then I changed the code to load the tga files and tried applying that texture to the model, and got the same results, no change in texture whatsoever, merely would use the one in the model.<br><br>I then realized that possibly since the png file already had the alpha set, when i converted them to tga files that it also set the alpha channel in the tga to be the same thing that was in the png files, so I have not had a chance to first resave the files as bmp to strip out the alpha info, then load those and re-save as tga files.. but I don't really think this is the issue, I think there is something I am missing either a flag or something when loading the texture or do I need to use updatenormals on the model before doing entitytexture, or do I need to select a specific surface in the model and apply the texture to that, then do the same for each surface in the model ?  <br><br>I am unsure, all I know is I get the same results, whether I use a createcube() or a loadmesh("../media/cube.b3d") and try to entitytexture(whatevermodel it is)<br><br>Now keep in mind I have a cel-shading routine I made from the code archives that I pass all the models into, which should not affect the cubes though, since I filter those out and only cel-shade the items, not the wall cubes ID=ID_cube, or 20 for hold(20)\item or hold(20)\item1 refer to the same model as I use copymesh to create the item from item1 after texturing it.<br><br>There is nothing real complicated in the code above.. Just wanted you to see that I was just loading the mesh, assigning it to a type field, and loading the texture assigning it to a type field also, then applying that texture to that mesh.<br><br>Please help... ;')  BTW: I am at work, or I could give you exact code segments.. but this is very close to working code at home, very little difference, I left out the rest of the loadmodels function, as it is not needed to understand the cube and texture portion.  The above code is from two separate functions, one called LoadModels, the other CreateGrid.  The CreateGrid just loops through to for loops from 0-9, and if the lvlgrid(countx,countz)\ID = ID_cube then it does the random texturing etc.. if it is not just processes the other items differently, cel-shading them etc..<br><br>Hope this helps, but I think I got way more in depth in this explanation then should be necessary for it to work. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
