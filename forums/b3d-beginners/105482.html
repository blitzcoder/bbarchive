</pre><br>I scoured the web for a few days to compile this. Please feel free to add any I may have missed. I love the edit button, so I'll be sure and keep it updated. I haven't contributed much to this forum lately but opinions and ideas, but I've posted a lot of stuff in the past I'm happy with, like fully functional dropdown menus. I have more on my computer I've never shown, so just let me know if it's wanted, and I'll post some. I have a mouse controlled level mesh editor, alphaed antialised text like you see in anime subtitles... all kinds of stuff. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Well maybe the goal should be for it to become comprehensive, then. My sources were of common screen resolutions, but after I got about fifty, I was like, okay looks like I got that one already, and that one too, so I stopped. If 4,650 of them are used by almost no one, or were only on devices from the 60s or something, I should probably leave those out, right? This is just to make sure games fill the screen on devices most people are using. screenresolution.org should be great for that!

(Use <a href="/b3ddocs/command_list_3d_cat.php?show=Graphics%20Mode" target="_blank">these commands</a> in Blitz3D.) Any other list is an error: you'll either include a bunch of obscure resolutions the currently-running machine doesn't support, miss out a bunch of newer resolutions that weren't available at the time the list was made, or most likely both.<br><br>Doesn't it annoy you when you go to play an older game and it offers you a flat choice of 640x480, 800x600 and 1024x768, none of which work correctly because monitors don't go that low any more? There's literally no reason to ever hardcode this stuff (a game generally has no reason to even know what resolution it's running at, outside of saving the settings), and plenty of very good reasons not to. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Yeah, I'm just coming from a place where for a long time my attitude was "1024x768 or die!" But now, sheesh, I myself have a new laptop that isn't, so I'm looking at flexibility. I'm glad you pointed out those commands, because I saw that Blitzmax or something has commands for detecting the resolution, and I wasn't sure if Blitz3d does. In fact, I'd like to transform this thread to be about that topic instead, if that's okay. One question I have is, how do I avoid stretched resolutions? The computer I'm on now is 1366x768, but it has an option for 1024x768, and when you select that mode, it gets totally distorted. I now know to avoid it, but how could you setup a Blitz3d game to, having no idea another persons actual screen aspect ratio? Post 4 too harsh? Ha! I always put on armor before going online ;) Nice of you to apologize though, and apology accepted of course. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If this happens, then the output will always look like crap regardless, and you programmatically trying to adjust the drawing will still look worse than if the user had picked the proper aspect ratio to begin with.<br><br>Overall, you do have a few choices:<br><br>1) Design the interface in your game to be aspect-ratio independent (e.g. on widescreen just draw a wider view of your game area, of adjust your HUD/borders to make use of the extra space<br>2) focus on wide-screen, and use letterboxing on 4:3 monitors<br>3) focus on 4:3, and use pillarboxing on 16:9 monitors<br><br>Whatever you pick, just keep in mind that for the overwhelming majority of computers sold in the past decade or so would have come with a widescreen monitor. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

And only use this part of the screen to display the game and black borders in the unused areas.
