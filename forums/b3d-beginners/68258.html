If the movies have a high resolution then it shouldn't be a problem.<br><br>A true cutscene player is something that may complicate things unneccessary. I did some simple players some time ago.<br><br>You need to create yourself some kind of action recorder. THis way you'll record your actions when you control the actors one by one. THen you'll replay the actions parallely, so all actors "act" the way you controlled them before. This may also contain animated meshes, of course, and advances character controls (including lip motion for pseudo lipsync). Finally, you should create a tool that allows to position WAV samples on certain points on a timeline, so you can edit the virtual audiotrack of a dialog or so. If you want real lipsync then you may have to use BASS dll, make sure to check the license of BASS before you do plans. You'd also require NPC meshes with lip bones, and maybe lid bones etc. for true libsync.<br><br>A cutscene player should ba capabl of playing any scene that is made of recorded user controls.<br><br>Sometimes, if the game is not built on a reusable game engine, it may be easier to script the cutscene right in the executable, eg. writing a hardcoded function that will move things and so on. Such a function can be used only for one specific cutscene.<br><br>Both methods may however use the loaded meshes. just make sure to reset their positions etc. after playing the cutscene. An other option may be to load the meshes seperately to a second world, that is far away from the actual game world (out of camera range). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Currently I am using the Realplayer format that allows to define a bitrate when you encode it, so it's up to you to set a quality from crappy to DVD-like. There are many DirectShow filters, including mpeg2, quicktime, I even remember there was a Flash player somewhere, so you could "play" Flash SWF files (I assume, only as long as they are not interactive)<br><br>And BTW Avi or Mpeg doesn't have to be bad. It really depends on the encoding part. Especialy AVI is only a name for a file that may use one out of a high number of codecs,  including mpeg2 or mpeg4.<br><br>H&amp;K - Deus Ex is a good example. I like their cutscene player very much, especially in version 1. Remember the random camera angle feature, so the scenes where never looking the same, but still using very nice looking camera angles. <br><br>But I think they didn't use B3D for Deus Ex (as you said ;). Not sure what you meant, use Blitz3D, or use a B3D animated model for the entire cutscene? The second wouldn't be practical IMHO.<br><br>Coding a cutscene tool and player module isn't that easy, especially when it comes to seamless integration into a game engine. And especially when it has to be good as eg. Deus Ex.<br><br>While there is another million of games that are using movies, besides codec problems this is the most flexible and future compatible solution IMHO. Games like NOLF where using Movies, although the engine (monolith) was surely capable of rendering cutscenes. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

MP4 or Cinepak so something. The diffrences are huge. You need to know th ecodecs. Additionally, you may set the size, framerate, bitrate, color depth etc. of the movie.<br><br>I'm using MAGIX Video Deluxe (guess MAGIX Movie Editor in the UK/US).<br><br>It is true, if the codec is not installed on a users machine, your movie won't play. If you programmed it badly then it will even crash due to a missing codec.<br><br>Unfort. the pre-installed codecs of windows differ very much with every version of the OS. There is NO codec that is present on every windows machine (other than total crappy, useless stuff). The solution is:<br><br>your game will open the movie. This will return a movie handle (see examples). If the handle is zero then the codec isn't supported. In this case ExecFile an external Codec Installer EXE that may be distributed with your game.<br><br>H&amp;K is right, a true Cutscene renderer that isn't based on movies may be something very nice, although it will take some time and hard work do create something good.
