Don't they realize that all you have to do to become a professional programmer, is program something in exchange for money, goods or other services? The 10 year old kid who writes a small calorie counting program for his family in exchange for twice his normal allowance is, in effect, a professional programmer. That doesn't really make you an authority on programming tho'. Instead of just saying "I am a professional programmer" you could say "I was co-author of successful game x" or "I wrote mega application y" and during my experiences I spent a lot of time studying whatever (DirectInput in this case).<br><br>What I can say without a question is that the self-proclaimed professional programmer who says "it can't be done" isn't a very successful programmer. Instead of just saying "it can be done using Userlibs" or "It's impossible without callbacks" perhaps you could explain *why* you think it isn't possible, and then try to figure out if a wrapper dll is such a bad idea after all. I mean after all any professional programmer worth his salt with as extensive DirectX and Win32 API experience as you guys should be able to write one in 20 minutes. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I didnt have any problems with it myself, but one guy was getting wierd results when using 2 FFB game controllers with the FFB effects themselfs. I think he said with using just one controller it worked fine.<br><br>I had a hard time trying to figure out why he had this problem since I couldn't duplicate it. But when my hardrive crashed back then, I lost my code for it and just gave up on that aspect of DirectX programming for the meantime.<br><br>I could do a specific dll for blitz again as I personally think making a DirectX wrapper library is easy ( as in getting it to work on my hardware ), but...<br><br>... I now have DirectX 9 installed on my machine. Thus, my dll would require DX9 on the user machine to run it. I get the impression from reading from just these Blitz forums through time I've been on it that alot of people are reluctant to simply upgrade/download at least the latest home user DirectX Dlls if they dont have it. So, I probably wouldnt have a good size "Blitz programmer" user base at least to support my efforts. Or would I? I really dont know.<br><br>&lt;rant&gt; With the new userlib functionality to make REAL pointers from my dll more easily accessable, I'm almost inclined to give a go to do things the right way, not the java way.  But for one reason, my laziness is holding me back from doing it because I despise the akward workaround hack to "Find" or "Get" the Blitz Window's Handle. IMHO, selfishness and stubborn way I rather not support that one thorn in my side when Blitz itself SHOULD freak'n simply supply me the Window Handle and Instance Handle Directly to use at my own whim! &lt;/rant&gt;<br><br>Besides my above rant, I just might be willing to give it another try if people here really would like me to make it. Ofcoarse, I too support the idea of rather seeing FFB support in Blitz instead of using an outside library to abtain the wanted results. Here, Mark can easily keep the FFB functionality using the current DirectX version that the Blitz products uses, whereas I simply can not. Ofcoarse, if I do it now, I can get that aspect of my DX Libray out of the way for other stoof.<br><br>Just thought I would throw in my 2 cents... :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You could come close as in writting a library to call the functions through COM directly, but again there is a library to be created and to go through.<br><br>With wrapping the DirectX functions to a managable usage for one to use with Blitz, there you have control inside the dll itself to work out any functions that require callbacks.

I was woundering how are you gonna do this. I suppose you're gonna use an external dll and a user lib to pass strings/ints. But more specificly what function values will be able to pass?
