But you can have several surfaces in a mesh so this is not really a problem.<br><br>Another issue is that the first time you try to run an executable made with Blitz3d, Windows will prompt to install directplay, but the installation is guided and easy and only takes a few minutes, but the computer needs to be connected to the internet.<br><br>Apart from that, it seems to work well even on recent computers, do a search on the forum there are several posts about (minor) problems with Windows 8 and Windows 10, with more details. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

However, Blitz3D's style of rendering doesn't take advantage of modern hardware very well, so it sees much smaller improvements than other, more modern, engines will.<br><br>Blitz3D is heavily limited by trying to do things on the CPU in sequence and feed them to the GPU one at a time, where a modern renderer does everything on the GPU in parallel and keeps it there, so while a modern CPU might be able to do sequential operations 10-20x faster than when Blitz3D was new, it doesn't get to take advantage of the ~100000x-boost in <i>overall</i> power machines have seen. Blitz3D's design is inefficient, but it's also the only way it could do things at the time when it was developed.<br><br>It still works out as a positive, but a very small one because there really isn't much work going into making sequential operation much faster any more - that entire model of computing is a dead end. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
