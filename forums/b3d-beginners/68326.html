Normally I use BMax but I got a job, a walkthrough through a barn that is going to be completely modernized. The main reason why is bought Blitz3D is probably the reason why many desperately want BMax 3D ;) My walkthrough has to be compatible with really antique (four years and older) hardware ;) So, even if MiniB3D would be fast enough, I would have too much trouble having to explain how to install openGl, getting the rights and so on, so maximum compatibility is asked.<br><br>Now I am just wondering, are there any 'must have' modules which would help me? I will be doing lightmaps a lot, what about vid-card memory? DDS sure, but let's say I have to deal with a 64 MB card, how big am I allowed to have my textures? Can I provide several texture sizes? Any things I should be aware off? I am thinking of having the doors open physically or would a simple animation be safer? Is there a way to record a path within the walktrough easily while walking, for later use and creating screenshots every frame? Is direct avi export possible? What about AntiAliasing? Are bumpmaps ok for old cards?<br><br>I guess that's it for now ;) but I won't be angry if no ones answers to this bulk of questions :) I hope to be allowed to post some wip in the showcase. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Using dds will shrink the amount of required ram dramaticly. although, for lightmaps you better use something nonlossy, eg. PNG. surf the code archives, there are many goodies, including something to save AVI (see userlibs section of the archives). Waypoint stuff is easy. When an object is moving along the waypoints, you may determine if the object has passed by the current "next waypoint" if one of the following conditions is true:<br><br>X,y or Z of the object was lower (than the corresponding x,y or z of the waypoint) before this step and now it's higher afer the step<br><br>x,y or z was higher before this step and now it's lower after the step.<br><br>In this case simply increment the counter for "next waypoint"<br><br>No rocket science.<br><br>Good luck! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You might be forced to use lower resolutions (640x480?) in order to keep fps and or memory use to a reasonable level. But that's pretty worst-case-scenario.<br>Same with DDS. I know nothing about it, but is that something hardware has to support or a dx7 thing? If it's hardware related, test it. Same with bump maps.<br><br>That's my bottom line basically. TEST to make sure it CAN work on those machines, before you spend a lot of time on coding, only to hit a brick wall and make you look silly in front of your client ;)<br><br>good luck,<br>D. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Alternatively something like fraps can capture the movie footage in real time although quality won't be as good usually.  <br><br>As far as I know blitz3d doesn't support bump maps natively, although people have written dlls for it - I don't use b3d as much as I used to so am not sure on this. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Unfortunately I won't be able to test it before.

But as they need it to gather sponsors for the costly modernization, they will want to have high-quality. So I will be doing two versions, one low-end and one max-res.<br><br>Ok, and I guess I will kill any physics and bumps if it's more hassle than joy.<br><br>One small question regarding the path creation, if I create a waypoint every x seconds I should probably write some sort of interpolation between the waypoints? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If they are the same for the next waypoint then there's no need to move the object. I do this to switch between walking and idle animations.<br><br>You're right, there's no correct realtime replay, but it prevents a whola lotta troubles. Trying to interpolate requires to predict the framerate of the next couple of frames, wich will result in incorrect step widths. Well maybe you'd do this more clever.

Just make sure to use the "did I already pass by the next waypoint? If so, increment waypoint counter!" method. BTW you may also combine this simple move-towards-nextwaypoint (without exact interpolation) with a realtime controlled thing for the idle phases. Shouldn't be that hard, simply calc the idle time between the first and last waypoint of the same position. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
