I've browsed and searched and found some useful stuff - thanks to everyone for sharing their expertise. I now want to put together my first game - a 2D sidescrolling shooter for now (I'll get around to 3D sometime but want to try something 2D first and something I can finish in a reasonable amount of time).<br>I'm looking for more or less finished simple games or tech demos that are well commented and relevant to the sort of features I will need for such a game: moving animated sprites, collisions, bullets, simple AI, etc.<br>Anything I create will, if worth releasing, be freeware.<br>Thanks in advance. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Which isn't to say that ya might not be better off taking the ol' 3D-as-2D route all the same, just that B3D will cope with 2D. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I own B3D (and yes I bought it all legal and above board before anyone asks:-)<br>I haven't done any B3D coding other than playing around with the examples although I have done a fair amount of coding in BASIC though mostly database apps. I wouldn't say I was toooo serious - I just want to play around for a while and assess Blitz and my own aptitudes re game development. As I said, if I produce anything that is worth releasing then it will be freeware (and open source).<br>Why buy a 3D engine then if I want to do 2D? Well I bought it a little while ago and now that I've finally got around to getting into it I decided I want to take it slowly and figured a 2D game would allow me to get a grasp on the basics of game dev without drowning in complexity.<br>Thanks for the tip on the B+ demo - hadn't thought of that for 2D examples (doh!)<br>Basically I expect to me working mainly with animated sprites so I'm glad to hear that should be fast enough in B3D. I had thought that B3D was a superset of B+ but perhaps I am wrong there?<br>BTW CodeOrc - what did you mean by referring to Photoshop as a 'sprite generator'? Is there an easy way to output a 'filmstrip' in PS that I'm unaware of?<br>Thanks again all and any further tips or examples welcome. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
