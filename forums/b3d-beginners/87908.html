Type objects are passed by reference rather than by value: the variables you manipulate directly are actually pointers (which is why 1. they can be Null, and 2. they need to be explicitly assigned an object with New). When you say<br><pre class=code>local p.planet = u\Galaxy[g]\system[s]\planet[p]
p\Data = blah</pre><br>you aren't creating a new instance of type planet; you're merely setting the pointer p to the same address as the pointer u\Gal...\planet[p]. If you like you can think of this as meaning that any changes you make to p will automatically update u\Gal...\planet[p], but the fact is that they're the same object so no updating is necessary at all.<br><br>Effectively this is the same as copying the integer handle of a 3D entity to another int variable; there's still only one object, but now two copies of its address. The only difference with type objects is that their type is checked at compile-time. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Also, the U.Universe_Info global has a + sign which I can open to see the Galaxy.Galaxy_info[36], but there is no + on galaxy to show me the system and planet types.<br><br>So at this point I'm a bit lost. Thought I was being brilliant by deciding to keep everything in nested Types so that I could easily call the information and it would be easy to write to and store it as a single file. It's been a few years since I picked up Blitz and tinkered so I just don't recall the proper way of doing it.

You're then using "s" as your array index. "S" never changes (it's never even set), so you're simply assigning each new system to index zero (which you'll probably never see anywhere else as you're counting from 1). In the planet loop, you've declared "pla" as your iterator and are using "p" as your array index - again, never changes and every object gets assigned to index zero repeatedly.<br><br>The other thing to bear in mind is that the Blitz3D debugger doesn't let you expand arrays in the side bar, so you'll never get a + next to u\Galaxy - you'll need to think of a different way of displaying its contents if you need to check on them.<br><br>I really, really strongly suggest that you get IDEal (if you haven't already) and turn on Strict mode, and leave it on. This will catch such errors for you at the coding stage (Strict in IDEal is different from Strict in BlitzMax - infinitely better, in fact - in that it doesn't wait until you hit compile or run, but rather highlights undeclared variables in red as you type). You'll need to get used to explicitly declaring things as Local a lot, but this is better practice than using implicit declarations, which are the road to misery (it'll also train you well if you ever want to move over to a C-like language, as C and its children don't allow implicit declaration at all). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I am completely unfamiliar with the usage of functions with that '.' separator in them. Took me nearly 45 minutes to catch that in my code because I kept getting an error on 'Illegal Type Conversion' that was driving me absolutely batty.<br><br>And from that I move into my next confusion. When you do the information pull you use a string to read information. It creates a '[1,10,4]' sorta thing. That absolutely confuses me.<br><br>First, where do the brackets come from? lol.

The solution I considered was to separate things into blocks of size. So trying to draw a moon at position .0000000001 and a planet at 100000000 doesn't create that huge discrepancy in range.<br><br>It looked really cool cause I did it in blitz3d and had meshes for the moons as well as high texture for the planets. It's been a while now so I don't remember the link, but there was a guy who had the latest NASA surface maps of stuff and moons that hadn't been scanned had been very creatively created using long range pictures. He also had very detailed meshes of nearly everything. I had to reduce the meshes quite a bit because they were massive. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
