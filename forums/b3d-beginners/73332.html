Im trying to learn to program.. but.. i dont know which of these i should begin my adventure in.. 14 years ago, i was a pro with Basica, but, its been a while :) WHat are the pros and cons, of each of the 3 products? which one should i begin learning, and taking to heart? I've been told there are gigantic differences in the programs.. please.. which would be the right one for me, and why? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's the latest one<br>that released also it has better object oriented programming<br>support which is very important.

It's based on DirectX7, latest generation FX are hard to impossible to achieve, eg. good realtime shadows. <br><br>BlitzPlus can do 2D only, but unlike Blitz3D it contains access to the windows GUI, o it's more targeted to Appliactions with windows, menus, lists etc. (Although there are some useful "homegrown" GUI substitutes for Blitz3D). It also has some extra 2D commands such as CopyPixel that allows a bit faster Pixel manipulations.<br><br>BlitzMAX is harder to learn, the programming concept is harder to understand. The synthax is only partial compatible with the original BlitzBasic. Object-Oriented Programming is  the goal, and the compiler works completely modular (so a simple "hello world" programm is only a few kilobytes, where Blitz3D appends the entire runtime.lib to a compiled EXE, wich is NOT modular). There are several 3D engines for BMAX, but as far as I know none is as stabile as Blitz3D. <br><br>BMAX is also a crossplatform compiler, there are versions for the Mac and for Linux, but AFAIK none of the 3D engines for BMAX supports more than one platform at this time. Noless, it allows to develop 2D Games on multiple systems with only one sourcecode. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
