------------------------------------------------------------

    INTRODUCTION

    FileBLITZer is a free file-shredding utility created
    in the BlitzPlus programming language. BlitzPlus is a
    BASIC syntaxed Windows API programming language
    created by Blitz Research Ltd.

    FileBLITZer provides a level of file destruction that 
    exceeds even many commercial file shredding software 
    such as Evidence Eliminator. While most file shredding
    programs provide a level of data destruction claimed 
    to be at "US DoD" standards - this standard is by far
    out of date, and is dangerous to be relied upon.

------------------------------------------------------------

    WHAT IS INVOVLED IN FILE SHREDDING

    Regular "DoD" file shredding invoked by most free and
    commercial data destruction software involves between 
    7-9 bit writing passes over the length of the file.
    This guarantees the data cannot be recovered by any
    software means, and also rules out recovry via electron
    microscopes with the old Scanning Probe Microscopy
    method. 

    However, times have changed. Magnetic Force Microscopy 
    (MFM) techniques currently in use OUTDATE the "DoD"
    effective file-shredding methods. And don't get lured
    into thinking "But I'm not doing anything illegal, so
    I don't need NSA-level shredding, they're never going
    to be accessing my stuff". Wrong! MFM readers can be
    built for under $2000. Every data recovery company has
    one. A snooping flatmate or employer can have all your
    deleted (and even DOD-Shredded) data for a mere $100
    down at the local data recovery co.

    Futhermore, as hard-drive manufacturers pack more and
    more data onto high-density platters, they start using
    methods of using neighbouring bits to record additional
    data. Even if your file is completely shredded, the
    information can be read from these neighbouring bits
    using Magnetic Force Scanning Tunneling Microscopy 
    (STM). Now we ARE talking NSA-level. :)

    Furthermore, the file entry in the FAT table can give
    many clues to investigations. Some shredding programs
    merely delete the file after it is "shredded", leaving
    the original file name and size information intact.

    Yet, FileBLITZer provides hope. :)

------------------------------------------------------------

    HOW DOES IT WORK

    FileBLITZer performs (up to) 35 individual passes on
    the file. Not 7. Not 12. 35! And I'm not talking mere
    random data or 0000s and 1111s.

    To truly delete a file forever, you need to align the
    magnetic field of the file and neighbouring bits, back
    to nothing. Neither 0 or 1. Of course every bit has to 
    be either a 0 or 1 as we are writing (not using a 
    degausser) so this instead has to be done using a 
    careful sequential series of bit masks which "pull" the
    magnetic in both directions to equilibrium. The 
    particular  series of bit-masks required is known as
    the Gutmann-Method, after Peter Gutmann, Department of 
    Computer Science, Auckland University, New Zealand.

    FileBLITZer is broken down into the following steps.
     - You select which file(s) you wish to "blitz".
     - The total byte-length is calculated and shredding
       begins.
     - 4 passes of random data are written initally. This
       is merely a precaution.
     - 27 (at most, depending on what shredding level you
       have selected) bit-mask passes completely overwrite
       the data beyond any recovery means known to modern
       science.
     - 4 passes of random data are written at the end of
       the alignment process to provide "filler" data.
     - The filenames are overwritten 35 times with the
       Gutmann method so even their NAMES cannot be
       recovered.
     - The files size entry in the FAT table is rewritten
       50 times with random sizes.
     - The data in memory which housed the information of
       what files are being shredded in RAM is also
       shredded by bitmask. RAM can store information even
       after your computer is closed down. This removes
       any chances of that happening. I know of no other
       program which takes this precaution.

    Now, the file is unrecoverable even by the most
    advanced magnetic force electron scanning methods.
    Nobody even knows the file name or file size. Even the
    system RAM in use has no idea what just happened. :)

------------------------------------------------------------

    WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

    Firstly - FileBLITZer is not fast. In fact, it's
    painfully slow, due to the way Blitz accesses the disk.
    But it's secure.

    If you're running any automatic data-backup software in
    the background, such as Windows System Restore, you need
    to disable it. What's the point in shredding a file if
    you've got another program making backups of all your
    data beforehand to make sure you don't delete anything
    important?

    If you ARE using a software recovery program, then not
    only will you need to disable it, but you'll need to
    "BLITZ" the backup files. Simply disabling it means the
    backup files will just stop being used. They're still
    there and data can still be recovered.

    If you are using Norton Unerase or Norton RecycleBin
    Protection, it is highly recommended you disable these
    utilities. There is no reason why having them active
    should cause any problems, but maybe they've put in
    some new-fangled thing to make protected backups of
    files that look like they're being "overwritten" by a
    virus. I don't know - but just to be safe. :)

    FileBLITZer is free for everyone. However, it is only a
    proof-of-concept program. It should not be taken
    seriously, and is used at your own risk. If it deletes
    all your data, fries your hardware, sets fire to your
    cat, or any other unforseen mishaps - I can't be held
    responsible. You're under no obligation to use this
    software, and doing so is your own choice.

This is a crap way of doing it, so now that I've got the seeking sorted out, I'll get it to dynamically create memory banks up to 5 megs, containing the bitmask to write, to drastically speed up large-file shredding. At the moment, with the code above, it takes about 10 seconds per meg. But considering I'm writing 35 passes (27+8 random data), 4.5 minutes per meg is a little on the slow side. ;) Writing 5 meg chunks should reduce this to about 2 seconds per meg. :)<br><br>+BlackD <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
