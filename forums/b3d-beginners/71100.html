I could be wrong though, as I don't use Blitz3D nor TeraPak these days at all ... moved on to BlitzMax.<br><br>In terms of protecting player profiles, etc, I generally come up with a way of generating a random key for encrypting the parts of the file that you don't want people altering.  This key is used in SeedRnd() before starting to encrypt the file.  I then XOR a randomised value to encrypt the data and the next value is also random (so that I'm not using the same number to encrypt all the data).  You could generate a key from the ASCII values of their name for example.  Just remember never to store the key in the file itself.  If a player then decides to alter some portion of the file in NotePad, a different key is generated at load time and they've currupted their profile.<br><br>Obviously you will also need to have some way of checking that they have done this, otherwise your game will probably crash.  The way I've done this in my current project is to store a random value for each level passed.  When a profile is loaded the program goes through each of the values in the profile and compares these with a newly calculated one.  As soon as one doesn't match it limits the level selection to any up to this point, even if those following are valid!  Serves them right to mess with the file.<br><br>As a side note, I only use text files for player profiles and configuration settings.  Level files are always stored as binary files in order to keep the size down.  I'm guessing you probably already do something similar anyway, but thought I'd mention it.<br><br>Hope that sort of helps. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

</textarea><br><br>Basically, it generates a seed (key) for use with the random number generator, which is based on the ASCII values of each  of the charatcers in the player's name.  This is then multiplied by 1000 so that similar names don't generate similar keys.<br><br>When the program goes to save the profile it generates a random number for each item in the profile, regardless of whether the player has it or not.  If the player does have the item, then this random number is stored instead of a simple 1.  0 is still used to say when an item is not in the player's inventory.<br><br>When the profile is loaded again, it gets the player's name from the profile and generates the same seed for the random number generator.  When loading the items a check code is randomly generated for each item.  If the value from the file is 0, the player doesn't have the item, so there's no problem.  However, if the two values don't match, then the player has tried to add the item in NotePad (or similar) by guessing a random number and changing one of the 0's.  The player is then not given the item and a flag is set to say that an attempt to cheat has been made.  Otherwise, the player is given the item.<br><br>Things to note are that the cheating player could guess the correct value to put into the profile, so it's best to use a wide a range of randum numbers as possible to make this more unlikely (values between 1000 and 2000 were used above).<br><br>Also, this method will not prevent someone from removing items from a profile, which they might do with a friend's profile, for example.  Something a little more complicated would be required, as you couldn't just XOR the encryption value with the item flag as a player would easily figure out that they would only need to change the value in the file by 1 to add or remove items from their inventory.<br><br>You might also want to include a player's score or other value that changes as they play when generating the key, so that the key itself changes over time, rather then remain static as this example does.  If a player then tries to alter their score, they will end up with no items in their inventory as none of the values will match when it's loaded back in!<br><br>Hope that sort of points you in the right direction. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
