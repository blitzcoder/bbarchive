I appreciate you taking the time.<br><br>The reason why my previous attempt failed was mainly because I had the DESTINATION fill placed procedurally AFTER the SOURCE fill, te intent was I think to populate a list of those available cells for testing areound the current test cell but of course the 'list' of types is always growing as populating the list of available cells adds them to the list of cells currently iterated.<br><br>Since one cannot simulatneously have expanding For/Each lists I think I need to contain one within the other (NOT simply nested) but perhaps where one is iterated through only by one instance whilst the otehr iteration is ongoing:<br><br>For example:<br><br><br><pre class=code>
