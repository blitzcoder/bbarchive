Add a GUI Tool that will guide you trough the creation of an installation script with a wizard or something (eg ISTOOL).<br><br>Bink is pretty expensive as far as I know. Also, stay away from MP3, the Owner of the patent, Fraunhofer IIS and Thomson Multimedia are aggressively forceing their rights, not only for encoders, but also for decoders (players).<br><br>Nothing's wrong with OGG, in fact it's the ultimative choice and even big companies think about to use OGG instead of MP3 in their hardware, simply because all licenses for MP3 for the upcoming hardware of the next years would cost the industry 500 Million dollars.<br><br>And OGG is about the same as MP3, maybe even a little bit better.<br><br>I guess there's no problem with Mpeg1 players, although I am not sure about Mpeg2, that is the format used by DVDs.<br><br>MP4 (and it's ripoff DivX) are very economic formats (concerning Filesize), tho the encoding is highly CPU intensive and even the decoding (playing) of these formats require fairly fast CPUs.<br><br>DivX takes License fees (tho it's a ripoff, as I said), but they also offer a socalled "indy-moviemaker license model" and AFAIR this is for free. Of course, only for indy projects. It could be an alternative for indy game makers.<br><br>MP4, the real MP4, invented and owned by Microsoft, some kind of secret uberweapon of billy boy since years is now conquering the hardware market. It comes inside the ASF or WMV format. I think there is no license problem for players since microsoft wants the format to spread all over, but one thing is for sure, MP4 Encoders are very expensive. I see them more and more, eg. in little PVRs that are recording Video right onto SD Ramcards, but usually they record in 320*240 Pixels only. It needs a fast processor to encode MP4 in realtime, especially in bigger resolutions. And I guess there are diffrent license Models for diffrent resolutions as well since you cannot copy DVDs in a decent quality in 320*240 Pixels, but you could with 640*480. It's hard to find a software MP4 Encoder, byside Micorsofts products (probably the free Media Encoder, but I doupt that it fully supports MP4). The problem with MP4, DivX etc. is that a lot of people have them not installed, so you would need to ship the codec with your product, and this requires a license.<br><br>Depending on the Media I use to release my Product (CD, DVD or Download) I would choose a format that fits best: for CDs and DVDs I wouldn't care about the file sizes and use a very common COdec like Cinepak with max. quality setting. In Downloadable Versions I'd think about to use placeholder short Videos instead, or no videos at all. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
