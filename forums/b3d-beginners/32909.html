I suggest writing a few (maybe start with a basic but complete Minesweeper clone) and gradually you will find yourself digging into the command reference for new commands.  After a couple projects are under your belt you'll be pretty familiar with all the various commands.  And of course, when you get stumped you can get specific questions (eg. how do I use this command?) answered by asking on the forum. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

(Give them sequential names though, don't overwrite early ones.)I might start by grabbing an image and drawing it. Then make it move, then make many images move, then introduce a background, then a moving background. Or I might try another method of doing the same thing in order to explore different commands. For example I might try arrays first, then types, then banks; try doing the scrolling using different commands and copying methods - horizontal, vertical, diagonal, arbitrary.<br><br>The idea is that one thing leads to another until you have assimilated the whole manual, or near enough to it. Usually in the process of doing this, many minor obstacles will be encountered and solved - things to do with variable definition and handling, arrays, loops and so on.<br><br>Make several of these simple starts - one in the area of graphics, one playing with sound, one playing with files and banks, one handling windows and events and so on. The whole lot very quickly merge and interact as the ideas begin to flow.<br><br>I have always found this learning method far superior to systematically studying examples and manuals. Doing the latter is simply studying answers, but programming is about asking questions first and finding answers yourself. At least that's what I've found. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In the old Amiga days, for instance, I found assembler programmers were very bad at doing this. There's nothing that can't be explained simply and helpfully. I remember when I finally did find out that the whole business just meant stuffing data into a handful of registers I was very annoyed - the whole thing could have been explained to me in a few pages instead of volumes of pompous (and expensive)waffle. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
