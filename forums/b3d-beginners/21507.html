I could not get my head around thing the book explained.<br>Sometimes it brought code up that I never seen and it did not even explain it, it just said "type this...." LOL.<br>I read TUTS on blitzcoder and I read the newbie guide with blitzbasic yet I never know where to start... and I learn something like "Print warren" and then forget it 10 mins later.<br><br>What I am basicly asking is where do I go now?<br>The book seems to be hard and for intermidate users when it says NEWBIES.... and tutorails seem to explain nicely yet very hard stuff even in the NOOBIE section.<br><br>Is it all very so easy but I my self am so dam thick I will never learn Blitz Basic?<br><br>I am going back now to try learn more yet probley fail very badly....<br><br>Any thoughts would be greatful.<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Waz<br><br><br>P.S whats this Blitz PLUS about? is it blitz basic just renamed? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The best way to learn, I think, is from examples. have a look at any examples, like some in the blitz basic help. <br><br>They may appear complicated to begin with, but change a few things, and take some things out. You'll soon see what things do and how to do things.<br><br>I think a lot of people have trouble with types to begin with. leave these until you have the basics down.<br><br>oh, blitz+ is a seperate product. it's much like blitzbasic2d, except it's faster and has built in window GUI commands. you can create game editors and the like. I think you're perfectly fine with blitz2d at the mo' but after a month or something you'll be wanting to get your teeth into 3d.

I read the blitzcoder tutorail about them (gloabal and local too.. kinda understand them) and I read the book section on varibles and also the manaul with BB about em.<br><br>Basicly I know that a varible is like a magic box, in this box I can contrain data or even more boxes.<br>For example a varible would be like this:<br><br>carspeed# = 10.5<br><br>carspeed# = carspeed# + 10<br><br>Print carspeed#<br><br><br>That will print 20.5 right?<br><br>So do I move on now to something else? or is there something else I should learn about varibles?<br>Thats my problem I find I never know if thats enough of that and then move onto something else? Not only is that one of my problems but I think when to start a project is...<br>Example say i learnt basics of varibles, arrays etc etc... I never know where to and how to start a project.<br>urmm lets see first line<br>AppTitle "My game"<br><br>YAY :)<br><br>EDIT: Should I just read through the whole of BB beginners section? should I follow my book from page to page or jump to things and try em out?

Variables are one of the key building blocks of all programming. The good news is, programming is really very simple. There are only a few really key concepts to grasp, which everything else is built from. That's not to say programming complex stuff is easy, but still, even the most complex programming is built around these few core concepts; I think you'll grasp the general gist of it sooner than you think.<br><br>At the bottom of all programming, you have your variables, you have your logic (IF *this* THEN *that*) and you have the stuff that controls your program's "stream of conciousness" or whatever you would call it (your loops, your GOTOs, your functions), and you have your inputs and outputs - loading stuff, scanning the keyboard, drawing to the screen etc - have I missed anything?<br><br>What I'm saying is that understanding variables is a HUGE part of understanding programming, probably the one biggest obstacle to understanding that the complete beginner programmer will face. Once you understand variables you already understand a large part of how computers fundamentally work. And arrays are just more variables. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
