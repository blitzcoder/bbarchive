B3D is the best choice for bones, apparently.

Nobody said you can't use bones in your animation app, you just can't use them within B3D to animate your object in code (rag doll physics for example)<br><br>2. X has bones (thought I mentioned differently), but they don't animate your mesh if you change them in code. But you still could use them for attaching objects I think.<br><br>3. Thats the most important: Even thought MD2 does not support bones, it seems to be the by far fastest model format (with mesh deformation animation). B3D with bones and vertex weights is the by far slowest, the more bones you have the worse it gets, as everything is done on CPU. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But old does not mean bad. There are just some features missing for current stuff (no bones -&gt; no physics and attaching stuff to the actor gets harder as you do not have bones which you can use as mount points. You would need to manually transform the mount points with your object or have a second object you parent to it which in the end is only the mount point animation (this could even be done as 3DS))<br><br><br>Animating in code: Bones are childs like other objects as well :) so you can easily rotate them. (don't scale them, this will give unexpected and normally quite bad results. Moving is a little pointless unless you want to tear them apart :) ) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If it did they WOULD animate your mesh if you changed them in code. Since they're not there, you CANNOT attach objects to them. You would have to use an exporter which converts bones to geometry and hide the geometry in order to achieve that.<br><br>Furthermore, the version of the X format that Blitz loads does NOT support mesh deformation of any kind. It supports the same hierarchical transformation of objects as 3DS.<br><br>I'm not 100% certain on what I'm about to say, but I'm pretty certain that there are no versions of the X format which support any kind of mesh deformation, I think even the most recent versions just use bones, but perhaps it is possible and I just haven't come across it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But I think you might be wrong on some of what you said.<br><br>  I don't understand what is meant by hierarchichal animation, but there are animated .x examples included with Blitz3D, they are in the samples directory in the installation.  I imported one into my modeling app and it seemed that animation was achieved by vertex translation.  I don't know it this qualifies as mesh deformation.<br><br> As for .x not supporting bones at all, I believe it can.  I exported a boned .x from my app, and looked at it in Notepad (.x is really a text format) and there was bone information within it.

This format uses mesh hierarchy to create the animation exactly the same way that the .3ds does. Each part or limb of the body is a seperate mesh the leg will be a child of the body - the foot is a child of the leg etc. To create the illusion of movement each "limb" can be translated or scaled in relation to its parent.<br>An animated model could also be just one single mesh. Think of a bouncing ball or a spinning cube ! Vertices are not deformed or translated its just tranforming the pivot point of the ball to create the illusion of movement.<br>The .b3d format also supports this type of animation although not many people realise this - you don't always need bones if you are animating a rigid body or a mesh that is composed of various "limbs".<br>With DirectX version 8 the .x file format began to support skeletal animation i.e. with bones. This is the format that Blitz3d does not support - you can load the mesh but it will always be static. The .b3d format is the only format that Blitz3d can use for boned animation.<br><br>Static meshes : .3ds, .x, .b3d<br><br>Hierarchial mesh animation using seperate "limbs" - .3ds. .x(DirectX7), .b3d<br><br>Animation using vertex translation - md2 <br><br>Skeletal Animation (Mesh deformation by bones) - .b3d ONLY <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
