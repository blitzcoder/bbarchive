In the program, the player is able to walk around a 3d environment, mouse look, walk up stairs, fall off ledges, and jump.  <br><br>This is not necessarily the best way of doing this, and it is far from the only way of doing this but you may find it useful.<br><br>Feel free to use the code in any way you want and/or reuse it in your own projects.<br><br>The media is found at this web address (&lt;1 MB)<br><br><a href="http://home.swiftdsl.com.au/%7ETmalcolm/Tutorial/Environment.zip" target="_blank">http://home.swiftdsl.com.au/%7ETmalcolm/Tutorial/Environment.zip</a><br><br>It contains a single 3d model and really basic texture which you are free to use as you wish as well.<br><br>Here is the sourcecode, fully commented:<br><br><textarea class=codebox name="code" wrap=OFF readonly="true" rows="15" cols="80">
