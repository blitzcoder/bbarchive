For example you have a While without a condition, this immediately throws an error at me?!<br><br>Also you have height fields in both. So my questions at the moment would be: <br><br>1. how does the mouse interaction work? (is it click-&gt;drag-&gt;drop or click-&gt;click to drop?)<br><br>2. why are you using the mouse x/y coords with an 'equal to' check of the counter position? Are all the counters 1x1 in dimension?<br><br>A couple of other things to note, you don't have any 'End Type' statements, this throws errors up! Also you don't have a 'Next' for your embedded 'For' statement?!<br><br>Having said all this, let's see if I can show you an example of the method I was describing. I would work on the basis of using functions to handle these as Types can be accessed anywhere in the program and it makes for neater programming :)<br><br>I'll presume that counters are placed on the squares to a maximum height of 4 counters on a square, and that the last counter placed on the square is always the first selected when the mouse if clicked on it.<br><br>Also as your not moving the squares around (I presume only the counters move), I will remove the square type as it is not required, i.e. it is represented but not necessary to track.<br><br><pre class=code>

The reason I used vars is because they were not needed in the type, in fact they were only needed once per iteration of the checking loop they were used in, so using vars makes all the sense!<br><br>stackorder = height??<br><br>You whole mousehit loop isn't making much sense to me, actbg will always be null because even if you get to a situation where you can set actbg=instbg, because it is in a loop, on the next iteration it will set actbg to null again?? why? The ONLY time it won't be null is if the last bg in the type list happens to match your criteria for setting actbg=instbg.<br><br>I am trying to understand but it's always difficult reading someone else's code, so it's not a dig just one of those learny curve things :D <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If when processing a condition and var finds the match in one of the instances then var takes on that instance not the last instance in the type. <br>  The use of the different XY's is for the conditions in my functions like my Final Undo, Draws, Moves etc and for checking the process altogether with Writeout files. The write out files will show me with the different xys how my functions handles or didnt handle the activeXY data. <br>  The Mouse loop is as I said in the notes. It passes through once to pick up the counter then passes through again to put it down. The first pass has its conditions and the second pass has its.<br>  This program is a variation on Soja "template" which was an advanced version of Perturbatio's counter controller program. I am extremely pleased with its heartyness so far.<br>I do not want to rewrite this program so any solution that does I wont consider. I dont have the time or desire to rewrite this from scratch, atleast not now.<br>  I did find one thing. While trying to do everything at once, I forgot the basic tracking of "from" squares. I also found its resolution of the problem by using a modified version of my Final Undo because it performs flawlessly. It performs after ActBG is turned off and that was my problem in the first place, that I could not control the instances after I turned of the actBG.<br>   I hope that clarified the issue. I may also be able to solve the stacking issue with the instbg\Stackorder. I have to track a Defender stack and an Agressor stack and all in the same square so thereby being in the same instance, I don't want to track it in the Counters Type at least not yet, It again will mean major rework. and redoing all my .data streams. For now I am still resolving the "from" square issue I won't get to the stack issue for a while. <br>When I finish my "from" square solution I may have the answer and if not I will look into your "multiple var of a type" solution. If you can still make any sense of this then I will appreciate any other input otherwise,<br>   Thanks for all your help. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
