Things I have working. I can fly my lander around, with Gravity working. I am using as close to real physics as I can. SSwift help me with that. Currently, if my forward Velocity if greater than gravity, I can actually achieve orbit, For me that is so cool.<br> Anyhow, my problem. When I come in for a landing, asuming it is a soft one, I don't know how to make My 'LEM' Lunar Excursion Module. Settle into a proper position. I tried Align to vector. but that did not work. I have a Sphere for my planet right now, with a lot of quads to make it smooth and round. <br><br> <br><br>Regards,<br>Eric <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
