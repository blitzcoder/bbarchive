Who's put BRL stuff on the curriculum? That's <i>really</i> interesting news! Do share.<br><br><br>To actually answer your questions, for educational purposes, I would <i>strongly</i> order them as 3, 2, 1; and yes Monkey supports 3D through Adam Redwoods' port of miniB3D (possibly other engines too by now, I don't keep up).<br><br>Monkey is a largely superior language to BlitzMax: it allows a cleaner and more modern coding style by supporting such features as interfaces, generics, and local type inference: living without these in the 21st century is near-impossible, and they make things much easier, safer and faster (e.g. you cannot guarantee the type safety of a collection without generics, meaning the BlitzMax compiler has a <i>great gaping hole</i> in its safety). Your students <i>will</i> want to learn Monkey's additional features, because they're a regular part of "real world" programming in mainstream languages like Java, C#, C++, etc.<br><br>The only features BlitzMax supports that Monkey does not are things like low-level pointers: you <i>do not</i> need these for an introductory class, so for your purposes Monkey is basically just a "better BlitzMax". The fact that your students' projects will work on pretty much any platform when compiled with Monkey (web browser? Mac? Windows? Xbox? iPhone?) has got to be a plus, too!<br><br>BlitzMax is in turn <i>strictly</i> superior to Blitz Classic (3D/Plus). It adds object-orientation, proper low-level pointer types, and garbage collection. You should <i>not</i> consider using a language without garbage collection for teaching beginners under any circumstances.<br><br>Blitz Classic is... adequate, but as you got from the previous paragraph, I would recommend against using it for teaching purposes. It only really supports seriously archaic programming styles, totally cuts off many important techniques, it's not "safe" (no GC, no proper type system), and there are generally just too many better options available to even consider it. I gave a long rant on why Blitz Classic is not suited for educational use here: <a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=96941#1123300" target="_blank">http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=96941#1123300</a> (my rant apparently persuaded the person in that thread to go and use it anyway, so it may be a bit useless...)<br><br><br>As in the linked thread, I would also seriously consider using a "normal" pedagogical language like a Lisp or ML dialect, if you have the option: your students won't regret it. Monkey is the best of your BRL options, but there are still other choices out there.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
