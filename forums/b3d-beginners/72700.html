Help!<br><br>I am trying to achieve a checker board effect on a large square mesh (single surface).  The checker pattern is randomized at the start of the game so I can not used a static grid texture and apply it to the mesh. I have successfully loaded a small UV mapped texture and can place this one "square" on the mesh at any location I wish.  Now I need to place another 20 or so on the same mesh to create my game board.  To keep things simple I really want to use only one mesh for the board and not a set of "tiles".  I have no idea how to best achieve this.<br><br>My first thought was to use multitexturing but that would be completely inefficient and has extreme limitations.  What I think needs to be achieved is to paint or stamp each little square onto the mesh texture at run time.  Am I on the right track here?<br><br>The code is rather long and complex but starts off by creating a mesh, a surface and 4 vertices at 0,0,0 + 100,0,0 + 100,0,100 + 0,0,100 linked to the surface.  I then connect the vertices to create two triangles from v0+v1+v2 and v0+v2+v3.  I then color the mesh white.  <br><br>Next I clear the textureflags and load a 16x16 UV clamped texture which is completely red (one square).  I then scale the texture by .10, .10.  Finally I texture the board mesh on texture layer 2 and position the UV on the texture so the square appears where I need it.<br><br>All thoughts and comments appreciated!<br><br>-- X2 <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I.e., There maybe a squares across the north (top) side of the mesh and diminishing in frequency as they progress to the south (bottom) side.  <br><br>Think: A pyramid of squares displayed on a square surface.<br><br>As I stated previously, I was really hoping to avoid a game board consisting of individual quads.  Doing so will add an additional level of complexity to the code as well as increasing the triangle and surface counts.  (Note to self: I could possibly code this using just 1 or 2 surfaces.)<br><br>Looking at other game examples, how would one apply a snow texture to the peaks of a terrain MESH (not terrain)?  Obviously this could be painted offline with a static mesh but if mountains had been generated dynamically then a function to locate high points and change the texture would be required.  Maybe the answer lies along the lines of a terrain editor or paint program?<br><br>BTW Chris, I used your Juicy Fonts utility on a project a few years ago and it was hands down the best tool for the job!<br><br>Thanks -- X2 <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If what I'm asking about can not be accomplished with Blitz and I learn as much, then I have achieved my goal.  <br><br>Let's say my next project was a plane with randomly sized and placed circles on the plane? The only way I can think to accomplish this would be to create one very large texture, draw all the circles on it then apply the texture to the plane.  Ok, I could probably do this on a few textures using transparency and get the desired effect.<br><br>Does anyone know of a way to cookie cutter and stamp a reasonably high quality texture all over a plane at random locations?<br><br>Maybe I should move this to the advanced 3D forum?<br><br>-- X2 <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
