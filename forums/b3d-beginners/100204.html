It will take many hours and years but being a stay at home father I have the time. I only hope that I will be able to create my vision w/ blitz3d.

If you only intend to use it as a tool in its own right then that's not a problem, of course.<br><br>B3D was originally designed without the thought of limits at all; any that exist are just because modern gaming hardware is so ludicrously powerful that it reaches heights that were beyond imagining when it was originally developed (e.g. B3D can only produce 32-bit applications; in 2000, the idea that you might even <i>have</i> 2 GB of RAM, let alone use it all up on one game, was ridiculous).<br><br><br>And yes, I would say creating is better than modding for a <i>total</i> beginner: as you've seen, to mod a game, you need to be able to read and understand the existing code so you know what changes to make, and what the consequences of those changes will be (and reading someone else's code can be pretty hard, depending on how different their writing style is). At the moment you should probably focus on completely understanding code that you designed yourself, where you have the major advantage of knowing the intentions behind everything that was written. Your original question was a tough one because the Wrestling Mpire games are huuuuuge codebases that most people here haven't read through (certainly I haven't) and therefore will be reluctant to recommend changes for. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Hopefully after I am done studying I will understand coding and more so I can set up a network for people to play each other on but for right now I am just focusing on getting my code set up and running. My plans are for myself to make my game more HD compatible than that of Wrestling Mpire and too allow for more customization of characters. I am not going to implement the whole 9 federation system but do on planning on having a wide variety of belts and other prizes. Going to try and somehow expand my game to allow for 1500 wrestlers plus their gear moves(which I want to create a interface in game that has bits and pieces of motions that you can put together to make a complete finisher). If this is something that I will not be able to do with Blitz3d please let me know so I can find the program that I need. This is not going to be a small project but I am going to see it through. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's a very "high-level" concept, far removed from the details that a game engine provides, and that sort of thing will reside in your own code (after all, B3D cares not whether you write wrestling games, racing games, FPSs, ...or even text editors).<br><br>I doubt you'll run into any "hard" limits with your project, so B3D will be a good enough tool for prototyping and getting your feet wet with writing code; once you've done that you'll have the skills to make an informed decision as to whether to finish the project using it as well. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Once you have the mechanics of the actual gameplay sorted you could worry about things like interesting scenery instead of a cubic platform.<br><br>As for gameplay, don't start with hundred-button combos and ragdolls performing advanced martial arts: start with three cubes stacked above one another that can throw straight punches. Once you have a system that can register hits and define a winner, move up to humanoid models... etc.<br><br>At the very least, at the moment you need to see the project as a series of prototype games that will lead to better prototype games later on. As you complete the small projects, you'll probably have more and better ideas for the following ones, as well as a realistic estimation of what you can complete. You'll also have complete and playable (if dull) projects early on, rather than slogging away at an unclimbable mountain project for years with no tangible result.<br><br>I would advise you not to worry about the end result at the moment.

Take a small fragment of the plan, one particular portion or concept, and make the code to deal with it.<br>This may be code that, say, deals with selecting a character - you may not have the character information programmed yet, but you don't need it for now - you just need to create some code that will take the player input and return a value to represent different characters:<br><br>For example:<br>This code assumes there may be images of the characters spaced 128 pixels apart horizontally on the screen at the top. By clicking the Mouse Left Button on an image, a number will be returned which can represent the character<br>[code]<br>Const WRESTLER_JIM=0<br>Const WRESTLER_FRED=1<br>Const WRESTLER_ALBERT=2<br>;... etc<br><br>Global PLAYER<br><br>If (MouseHit(1) And (MouseY()&lt;128))<br> PLAYER=GetCharacter( MouseX() )<br>End If<br>Function GetCharacter(X)<br> Return Int(X / 128)<br>End Function<br>[code]<br><br>4) Once you have your code snippet for that one detail working as intended, you can move on to the next - with the added benefit that now you have some basis to work from (i.e. in our example, we now have the values for the characters!)<br>5) As you progress, you will get stuck, realise things that could be done differently, realise you've made mistakes or find things that just don't seem to work right... but you will be learning all the while!<br><br>Hope this helps some, if it's any consolation, I am the same age as you! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
