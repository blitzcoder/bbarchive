Generic event management would also be cool.<br><br>It has been a very very long time that I haven't been programming in Blitz3D anymore. I am therefore not up-to-date anymore with the latest and/or established best practices.<br><br>I have at the moment Blitz3D and the SpriteCandy package (I wish the latter one would have existed back in the early days of Blitz3D!!!).<br><br>Please don't reply with "you could easily do it yourself... delta time... blabla". I am not a good programmer but I do have some basic Blitz3D experience. For those of you that have the CD version of Blitz3D - the open-dna demos were written by me a long time ago.<br><br>What I am looking for is a robust, tested and lag free implementation of reading and queuing user input and managing time. I believe that a guy called swift (or something like that) developed an event management framework.<br><br>Your help in finding the best solution would be greatly appreciated. It's very difficult to dwelve through the forums and try to separate the "HI GUYS HERE IS A COOL LIBRARY" from the stuff that really works and is widely used.<br><br>Thanks in advance for your help.<br><br>Kind regards<br>Reda Borchardt <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I only want to make sure that I take whatever is considered to be the best in class at the moment and is ideally widely used.<br><br>Rob Hutchinson has for instance written an excellent include to manage keyboard scancodes that can be found in the code library under "input". I just don't know if it's still an up-to-date method of doing this or whether there already is a much cooler library.<br><br>I think that you have to check the forums on a daily basis to get a feel for this.

It may also depend on the kind of game. Don't know of any input userlib. There are some libs to handle certain things, like catching the Close Button, or utilizing dragndrop from explorer, but no generic input lib. Well, I never searched something like that. Probably you'll find it in the userlibs forum section, if there's such a thing at all.<br><br>But hey, if it works then who cares about how old it is? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
