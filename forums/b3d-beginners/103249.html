Take google translator translate a document and try to understand, I think I'm really gross and I can not learn in theory quickly and I have to go to practice and through brute force in the end fail to understand things. Now, as a good son prodijo after being in unity about two weeks or more, I regrreso to Blitz3D, understanding at last what is object oriented, but when trying to understand the API of Unity, is like getting a kick in the balls and I think I can continue to try doing something with Blitz3D and very possible with the passage of time to stop making menus and make a game, while blitz continue working. <br><br>Now the technique is to start with the menu of the game, but from the level, perhaps <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
