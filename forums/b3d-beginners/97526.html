Just use LoadImage("Media\img_001.png") instead of LoadImage("img_001.png") and it will work exactly the same way, but none of your resources will be visible in the top-level folder.<br><br>You can also do this with userlibs, if you're using any, but the process is a little more complicated. This is good for <i>very</i> non-technical users who are frightened of DLLs.<br><br>(You can also use the other standard ways of describing a Windows path, if you need to for some reason.) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If the exe is moving to an arbitrary location, it won't know its position relative to the media's location. Unless there's some way of storing the absolute path of the media before the exe is moved - not easily done since it would require the thing to run and somehow update itself? - this information is probably not available.<br><br>In short, <i>tell them not to do that</i>. It's <i>not</i> your job to fix things that the users wilfully break! In fact, doing so is actively bad as it encourages them to break more things in future. If they want to break your product, they should be left hanging! They should copy the exe and media all at once (have the installation instructions clearly say, "copy all of these files and folders").<br><br>If you make sure that the contents of the zip - exe, media folders, lib folders, etc. - are held within a single top-level folder named after your game, it may make it easier for the user to extract it, as they will appear to be unzipping just one folder thing, as opposed to a bunch of stuff suddenly appearing on their desktop or wherever.<br><br>The other option is to go for an automated installer-creator tool. The only one I know of is InnoSetup (other users will know more about this, and it has been discussed in depth in the General forums).<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I used it for both of the projects I completed in the past; Inno Setup creates powerful and complete Windows installers, complete with the ability to add registry keys, package your media in the installer using LZMA compression, the works. If you use Inno Setup, you'll find that a script of roughly seven lines will allow you to install your entire game to a folder in Program Files and add shortcuts to the start menu like any professional program. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
