I didn't word it too well there either, or I guess I just thought of a better way of asking the question, which is how can you get sharper colliders? What I mean is, it's still a sphere no matter what you do with it, so it inevitably floats around when it's near any corners and gravity's on, and "Slide, but not down" doesn't always work, as you can see in the above link's example. The person who started that thread was always having the character slide off edges, which I noticed when I first started messing around with collisions but figured everyone must know how to fix. That doesn't seem to be true though. My fix was to make the collision sphere a strait up and down pencil, basically. It worked, but caused major clipping problems. So I figured maybe have four all connected, like this:<br><br><img src="http://h1.ripway.com/fox95871/fournarrowcolliders.JPG"><br><br>That, or somehow getting a cube or some other sharp mesh to load as a collider would be ideal I think. Someone also suggested the Driver demo to me, but that was a little more complicated than what I'm looking for, since my character doesn't need traction, bounce, and whatever else that code had, impressive as it was. I just need the effect of an octagonal cylinder basically, now that I think about it.<br><br>Sorry this was so wordy, I hope people will have some equally wordy suggestions though! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Try repositioning them relative to each other (or to a particular one of them that defines the basepoint of the character) after each movement, so that they move as a rigid cluster.<br><br>If you need more precise collisions, then you need to either look at convex hull collisions or a physics engine. You should find both by browsing around this site. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I also read here and there about problems with speed when using convex hulls, and friction or something caused by them not being sphere based. So at this point I think I'm going to go with my original idea of having four colliders fused together, except now with eight. I did that once before and it resulted in them not staying together, but I'll put up an example in a few days so hopefully someone can show me how to make them stay together this time.<br><br>Thanks for the help so far! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
