If it were a "#", the function would return a float (and functions without any suffix at all are defaulted to returning integers, but you can still put a "%" so it means integer as well).<br>Mind you don't necessarily have to return anything at all, even if you put one of those symbol-suffixes. They can just be used if you have to return something and that something isn't integer.<br><br>Now for the pseudo-code (that's probably why you didn't understand much - that and the fact that it didn't have much INDENTATION - bad Matty &gt;:( ), it's portraying the layout of your program flow. The way things should happen to get the result you want.<br><br>You keep drawing the menu\game\whatever and checking the current game state. <br>If, for instance, you are in the menu and the state is "menu", then keep at the menu (meaning, don't do anything - you don't even need to check this specific state). <br>If it's "play", then start the game. <br>If it's "quit", end the game. And so on.<br>If the player puts the cursor on the "Options" button and hits the mouse\keyboard, then you could change the state to "options" so that checking you keep doing every frame will understand that and change the screen to the options screen.<br><br>You need to code what you want to happen when something happens, in the cleanest, fastest and most economic way you <i>can</i>.<br><br>EDIT: I hope you noticed that you write code just by thinking what you want to do - Blitz3D is so high-level you can almost write in english.

</pre>About that LoadLevel function, he was showing how you could start a function that loads a level. You would code it so it would take a single parameter (the <i>filename</i> of the level to be loaded). You would code it so once you call it, it takes care of loading the level and setting up the data for you.<br>If you're doing a tile-based game, for instance, you could code a LoadLevel function that would parse the file and set up the tile arrays for your map, load the graphics, etc.<br>He placed "level1.dat" just as an example of how you would call that function. When you have your game going on, later, that's how you'll call the functions - "if now we have to play level 3, then I'll call the LoadLevel function with that level-3 file I made in my game editor that I coded myself".<br><br>If it's hard for you to understand these concepts, I suggest you take a look at the old BlitzCoder articles that cover much of 2D game programming, and a bit of 3D coding as well:<br><br><a href="http://membres.multimania.fr/blitzcoder/articles.shtml" target="_blank">http://membres.multimania.fr/blitzcoder/articles.shtml</a><br><br>Although somewhat pop-uppy, that website holds all the information you are looking for, with classic articles that seem to have been forgotten - they cover a LOT of game coding aspects. <br>Please give yourself the time to see what articles it has; it's by far the best suggestion and material I can give you or anyone wanting to improve with BlitzBasic\Blitz3D. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So, my solution is to have two simultaneous programs. Note that this is not the only way to do it. But, imagine you load your record and it puts you in your spaceship looking at a map. You select the destination and it sends you there.Once there, you can get back in your ship and it puts the map back, as you last saw it.<br> The mechanics are fairly simple:<br><br>          1) You load your game which goes to a different loop in the  program WHICH IS JUST THE MAIN MENU and THE MAP.This program is consantly writing one number value to a data file, that being the level you will be at.<br><br>         2) When you go to the level your program performs ReadFile() on that file, telling it which level to load in your setup coding/functions.<br><br>         3) When you get back in your ship your GAME PROGRAM saves your record and ends itself.<br><br><br> The key lies just before Step_2. Look up in your command reference ExecFile(), an obscure but phenomenal command. The game is then divided into two parts: a 2D menu and a 3D game. Your menu program calls the game executable with this command: ExecFile("3D.exe") but make sure that you keep it running, so that when you end the other, it's still showing. The main purpose of this is to not have to load all your resources, so that your game can run smoother. The downside is that you have two programs running, but if your menu isn't too complex, it shouldn't be too bad.<br> Another isssue is that you can't do this if you have the demo version of Blitz3d. As I said,I'm sure there are other ways to do this, but it works best for my game so far.<br> This is just an example though, it doesn't have to be a spaceship, it could be portal or a path or whatever.Further, there doesn't nees to be a map, it can all be done behind the scenes and the player might not even know...especially if it's fullscreen.<br><br> This maybe was too long, but I hope it helps.<br><br>EDIT:Cool example, Novagen.<br><br>EDIT: This I guess isn't the normal way, but my whacked solution when I was stuck.

White space makes no difference to Blitz, but it makes a HUGE difference to humans for telling what's what. For example, this little beauty of an <b>If</b> statement:<br><br><pre class=code>If bomb_y
If bomb_y&gt;=29
bomb_y=0
Else If bomb_y&gt;=skyline(bomb_x)
score=score+5
skyline(bomb_x)=skyline(bomb_x)+30
If skyline(bomb_x)&gt;=29
skyline(bomb_x)=29
score=score+15
EndIf
bomb_y=0
EndIf
EndIf</pre><br><br>Yech. I'd have to read it three times just to be sure what connected to what. Have a look at this, same code, but with indentation:<br><br><pre class=code>If bomb_y
    If bomb_y&gt;=29
        bomb_y=0
    Else If bomb_y&gt;=skyline(bomb_x)
        score=score+5
        skyline(bomb_x)=skyline(bomb_x)+30
        If skyline(bomb_x)&gt;=29
            skyline(bomb_x)=29
            score=score+15
        EndIf
        bomb_y=0
    EndIf
EndIf</pre><br><br>Easier, eh? Now you can tell at a glance which code belongs to which <b>If</b>.<br><br>Next item. Why are you calling <b>title()</b>, <b>level1()</b> and <b>level2()</b> before the graphics have even been set? That could be part of your problem right there.<br><br>Also, look at your code a sec. Having an entire copy of the main loop inside a separate function for each level is... Well, inelegant at best and downright clunky at worst. It adds WAY more repeated bulk to your program than it needs. Try something cleaner like this:<br><br><pre class=code>Graphics 640,480,0,1

Const In_Game = 201
Const In_Game_Paused = 202
Global GameStatus = Title_Screen

;---FUNCTIONS HERE, AS USUAL---;</pre><br><br><br>That's a much simpler method. This way, you only have to make one main loop. Imagine, with the code you've got now, if you made 50 levels, then decided to change the way the main loop works. That's a LOT of rewriting, even with cut-and-paste. The less times you have to repeat something, the less chance there is of you overlooking an important detail. So basically, lose the main-loops-inside-the-functions, since apart from anything this code is useless with that. XD The code in the functions should just be one-shot code that the program passes through, runs, and continues on through the main loop.<br><br>If you need variations in the levels - i.e. different sets of enemies, different behaviours, etc - then try something like this:<br><br><br><pre class=code>Graphics 640,480,0,1

In one box, you have "GameStatus = Title_Screen", and in another, you have a different variable "Game_Status". The underscore will make Blitz think that you have two different variables, "GameStatus" and "Game_Status". I'm not sure if this is only a typo in the post, but you may want to double check the variables in your program.<br><br>Also, I think it's pulling the "wend without while" error because you are using the "Else" statement in an unusual way. I rarely ever use that command, but I believe that the "Else" statement is expecting an argument on the same line. I could very well be wrong, and if I am, please correct me, but try replacing your code from:<br><pre class=code>

Remember, "GameStatus" and "Game_Status" are completely different variables, so the code you provided would actually make Blitz return "0" or "", because you never actually changed "GameStatus". Whichever variable you choose, just make sure it's consistent throughout the whole program.

It then sees <b>KeyDown(57)</b> as the beginning of a <i>new </i><b>If</b><i> statement inside the current </i><b>Else</b><i> statement</i>. Then, it sees <b>EndIf</b>, and ends that <b>If</b> statement, but the first one's still in session, and everything afterwards still seems to be inside it, to the compiler.<br><br>Here's a tip: to avoid such confusion, never use <b>Else If</b>. Put them together in one word: <b>ElseIf</b>. Then your programs will come out like this, and the compiler will interpret them correctly:<br><br><pre class=code>

Either method will work, but the first option is cleaner, quicker and more efficient.<br><br>Basically, what you had before was this: you had an <b>If</b>, then an <b>Else</b>, then you had a new <b>If</b> inside the <b>Else</b>. When the second <b>If</b> ended, the program was still inside the <b>Else</b>, right the way down to the <b>Wend</b> command. Since the <b>While</b> command, at the start of the main loop, was outside that <b>Else</b> statement, but the <b>Wend</b> was <i>inside</i>, the compiler wouldn't match them together, thereby thinking you had a <b>Wend</b> with no <b>While</b>.<br><br><b><u>EDIT:</u></b> After reading that last "explanation" paragraph of mine, even I can barely understand it. All I see is "blah blah blah <b>If</b> blah <b>Wend</b> blah blah blah <b>Else If Wend If Wend Else</b> blah blah BLAH."
