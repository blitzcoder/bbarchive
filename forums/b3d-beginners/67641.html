My name, at least online, is Foolish Frost.  Good to meet you all.<br><br>I would like to start by saying what I decided to collect for my design kit, and see what your thoughts are on my choices.  I hope this will be of use for others, to see any mistakes I might have made, and to see what tools are seen as the best for use.<br><br>First, I decided on Blitz 3D.  This was not an impulse choice.  After 6 months of leisurely research, I came to the following conclusions:<br>- While cross platform development would have made me happy, it just would not happen without a mac computer to compile the code on.  I also needed 3D for the kinds of development I was needing to do.  This means that Torque would have been the only other option, anyway, and was not designed for rapid enough development for my needs.<br>- DarkBasic Pro was the only other option, and the fact is, there was a significant number of comments across the internet speaking of it's stability.  In this case, it's LACK of stability.  While I take all comments with a grain of salt, when an opinion can fill a saltshaker?  Nuff said.<br>- The B3D demo allowed me a LOT of testing options.  This tells me that they have little to nothing to hide about it's function.  The demo for Darkbasic did not offer the same 'open' felling.<br><br>Final result, Blitz was purchased.<br><br>I also purchased the book listed for it on this website: Blitz3D Programmers Manual <br><br>And while I know that all of the data in it will be on this site, let's be honest:  I read BOOKS.  It's a 'me' thing.<br><br>Next, I looked at extensions for B3D that would allow me the options I would need for a wide spectrum of development projects.<br><br>The following things were selected by myself:<br>-  PowerPacker by Blitz3Dfr:  The ability to combine loading system for models and media is not a small thing, yet this packaging system IS inexpensive.<br>- BCF 3.0 by Blitz3Dfr:  This seemed like a very clean and modifiable addition for making interface systems.<br>- JV-ODE-V121-Blitz3D:  I looked at both this and the EasyTOK systems for physics, using the demos to make some assumptions about the two systems capabilities.  The final result was that JV-ODE seemed to be capable of being scaled to the largest number of projects, and the car demo for the JV-ODE just seemed superior in my examinations.  Please keep in mind, this was 90% taken from what I could learn in the demos, so it is possible that I could have been mislead about the potential of EasyTOK. <br>- particleworks by gosse:  This free particle system seems to have all the basics I may need.  It also seemed to handle the display or particles without too evil a slowdown of screen renders.  Also, the ability for particles to stop at meshes should not be underestimated.<br>- FastImage_1_3_3 by MixailV:  This thing's just FAST for rendering images on the screen.  What use it will be is questionable, but if I ever need it, it's here.<br><br>And that covers the B3D internal additions.  <br><br>Next up, I had to choose external tools I might need.<br><br>- First, Blender3D for modeling and animation, at least for the moment.  It's wide range of functions allows it to be used for nearly everything.  Except for mapping, it seems...  All attempts to export files in 3DS, X, or even lightwave format all end in flawed data that most imports fail on.  ESPECIALLY with complex models.  Maps are OUT.<br>- Sooo, I grabbed 3D World Studio.  It's built in modeling tools help to limit map design complexity.  Considering that the map needs to run with minimal stress on the engine, this is more than a good thing.  It did not take long to see that the lighting system it contained was limited, to say the least.<br>- Gile[s] became the obvious choice.  It's ability to light complex scenes quickly, and with beautiful effect cannot be understated.  It also comes with a sample importer for B3D, allowing me to even more quickly understand the idea of map-loading code.  As a part of this, I would like to also say I grabbed tree[d]<br>- Gimp was mandatory.  I use it for all of my texture development, and it does it well.  The fact it's free is like making it out of candy.<br><br>Shall we tally up what the total cost of my new hobby is?  <br><br>I thought we might...  &lt;grins&gt;<br><br>Ok.  <br><br>Blitz3D and book: $125<br>Gile[s]: $50<br>PowerPacker: $16.90  <br>BCF Library: $28.17  <br>3D World Studio: $80<br><br>That's all the ones that actually cost money.<br><br>Result: $300 <br><br>&lt;Looks about&gt; <br><br>That's the cost of what seems to be a complete gaming development kit.  Anyone else think I missed anything?<br><br>Anyway nice to meet you all, and hope to be around for a while.<br><br>Foolish Frost <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
