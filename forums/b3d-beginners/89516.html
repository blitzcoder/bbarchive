The words must be between 3 and 9 letters l;ong, with no slang or proper nouns.<br><br>Everything's going well, and the computer AI guesses from a list.<br><br>My concern, is that  of course, slower CPUs will make fewer guesses than a faster CPU.<br><br>To enable AI guessing, the program searches lists of words in files.<br>The dictionary lists are separated by Initials, i.e. 26 lists one each for a, b etc. and arranged alphabetically.<br>This makes searches faster in some respects, but also means that there's no real preference over the length of words.<br><br>(There's no way to identify the length of a guessed word, util, of course, that word is READ from the file.)<br><br>If I arranged the words by  length, then the checking of the validity of the word (i.e. are ALL the letters available) would take longer per 'guess', since EVERY letter in the word would need to be checked, but of course, I'm now checking the longer words first...<br><br>With large enough dictionary lists, it's possible that slower CPU wont even check the entire dictionaries. Therefore, some guesses will NEVER be encountered.<br><br>I am considering some method of tracking the time it takes to make guesses, i.e. if it takes 5 seconds for the computer to scan through the first letter's dictionary, then it's taking too long, since ideally for 9 letters, to scan for all guesses in 30 seconds, would need around 3 seconds each.<br><br>Of course, there's some difference in the length of the dictionary lists, but this is neglible.<br><br>I store all the guesses attempted in a type, along with their lengths so that I can adjust the output later to reflect a "SKILL LEVEL" this seems more appropriate considering the differences that may presented just due to hardware.<br><br>I'm not sure how to deal with the effect of hardware slowdown.<br>Frame-limiting could restrict 'superfast' computers, but the issue is more to do with slower processing.<br><br>One consideration may be to suggest a "minimum system requirement", though this still wouldn't affect the possibility of , say, running a virus checker in the background, which would cause the AI to complete fewer guesses in the allotted time.<br><br>Does anyone have any suggestions/ideas for this?<br><br>Would it possibly be better to hold the dictionaries in RAM?<br>The average filesize of a dictionary I am using is around 30k<br><br>30k * 26 letters ~ 800MB<br>This seems a bit heavy :S <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Instead of trying to make an 'honest' AI, you could choose one of the words from the dictionary, and scramble that to start off the game. Then the AI allready knows what word can be made of these letters. You would then need to find a way to emulate the computer not finding the word somehow.<br>I think it would also contribute to the 'solvability' (not sure if that is a word) of the game. If you randomly choose 9 letters, and they are all consonant, it could be hard to create a word from it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Also, less chance to even allow for a 'second-best' guess offering.<br><br>I store the valid 'guesses' that are chosen, so that after the time-critical period is over, the program can decide on which guess to offer (i.e. longer or shorter words) depending on 'Skill Level'.<br><br>Also, since the distribution of letters is from specific amounts of each, assembled into consonants and vowels, then the computer AI can be forced to select between x and y vowels and u and v consonants for example.<br>A human player is free to choose all consonants or all vowels should they wish... they still need to make a word as well :D<br>I appreciate, this isn't something anyone'd realyl be aware of unless they know the TV show. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This should make it quicker at least to find words beginning with say, "z" because it can start right at the 'z' dictionary, rather than go through a-y first.<br><br>The real issue, though, iws the fact that more than one word may be formed.<br>To try and give a simplified example, imagine the nine letters were:<br><br>REASONING<br><br>(convenient, huh? ;)  )<br><br>Anyway, the search begins, first looking for words that begin with 'R' so the first dictionary file it checks is the 'R' dictionary.<br>The alphabetically listed words inside 'R' range from, say, RABBLE to RYES or something, for the sake of argument, let's assume the first VALID (i.e. can be made from the letters available) word that is found, is "RAGE". This word is stored in a Type, and then the very next word, is "RAGES"<br>This is in fact, a "better" guess, since it is valid AND is longer.<br><br>However, making valid guesses takes longer, as an invalid word, i.e. "RABBLE" would quit checking that word as soon as the checking function reached the first "B" (the third character).<br><br>Therefore, it's possible, that words such as "REASONING"l, while blatantly obvious, may not be ound, if there are too many other valid words in the dictionary beforehand - which push the 'time taken' on 'guessing per letter' over a pre-set limit.<br>Without such a limitt, more words could be found, but there's that it would not find as many potential valid words, or that the time taken to scour the lists would far exceed the 30 seconds overall.<br><br>Also, it's not so much, slower PCs working as fast PC's would, but also that fast PC's may well be 'Too Good'.<br><br>---<br><br>You've made a really good point about working to the format of the slower PCs, making that a kinda benchmark, and slowing down anything that's faster. This would seem the best avenue to take, just not sure how to necessarily know HOW to go about this...<br><br>I think what I'll do for now, is quit worrying about it as yet, continue with how it works for now, and onec I have something 'playable' I can ask some folks here to est it and ghopefully get some speed feedback from trhe blitzers' PC specs ranges :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
