There are several fruit items laid out in a grid format, the player rotates around the outside edge using the mouse, when the player presses the mouse button, he lauches the player object, in this case a sphere model at the objects on the grid, also, the puzzle idea is out the window, instead in its place, I would like to add a Matrix bullet time.  Also besides the fruit items, you have a (?) item, which changes into one of 5 items, including +10,-5,1up,rip tombstone, clock, if you hit the clock, you get the matrix bullet time affect, but it allows you to clear off whole rows of items, no matter what the items are.<br><br>So, I have everything working including multi-hit combos, except for the matrix time affect thing, allowing you to clear whole rows off for a period of time.<br><br>Any ideas, how something like this could be added, I suppose you guys will need my source, which there is quite a bit of, as you can imagine since I am so close to being done, if anyone would like to help me out, please email me at storm3@... so I can email you back with the sourcecode and media needed, to test with.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Ken<br><br>Sorry all my posts seem so unclear, I wasn't aware that you guys felt like that.
