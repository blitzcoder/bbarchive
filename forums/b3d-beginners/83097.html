You also need to assign people specific tasks to individuals, coding wise and art too, else you get all sorts of different styles.<br><br>I can't stress enough though, you need people who are decent coders for this to work, else you'll get someone doing physics and making a complete arse of it, not designing code so other people can read it and not making the code "plugable" so it can be removed without too much hassle.<br><br>You should try, something very simple, for a community project, just to get the feel for it and get it finished, than move up from there.

Maybe you should learn something a little easier. It will advance your knowledge more, than doing a task your probably not going to be able to complete. There is nothing better for your learning and confidence, than starting a project and actually finishing it. It teaches you the patience and estimation it takes, even for a simple game. You have stuff like front end graphics, GUI, high score tables, computer AI (even if it's very simple)<br><br>It might seem like a good idea to do an RPG, because that's your favourite game, but RPG's are incredibly time consuming and difficult games to program.

I had previous programming and art skills, since old amiga days. I recently managed to finish coding a generic RPG program (without any graphic work, all there is: moving cubes, a 3rd person smart camera system, sprites, enemys with some AI, rectangles instead of grids in inventory, etc...) that could be a solid base for further development, fully tested and with no errors...<br><br>Now I'm plugging in the network parts, which is, by far, the most difficult task, trying to make it work in my local network...<br><br>Just here to post some advice:<br><br>1) b3d is the most open language for programming games. If you ever feel tempted by other engines (let's say torqxx, gamestudxx...), keep up with b3d. <br><br>2) learn about each aspect of the project separatedly. As Ross said, make it pluggable.<br><br>3) maintain a logic structure in the program -Otherwise you'll end up messing with 32.000 lines of code- From a main code, call functions. Modify these functions. Fully understand TYPES, POINTERS, and ARRAYS<br><br>4) code the game first without graphics. Just moving cubes and sprites. Dont be seduced too soon for particle-systems and realtime shadows. First make it work with cubes.<br><br>5) learn maths. Avoid b3d collision system. Code your own pseudo-Physics routines, as 3rd. party physics are not always what you need for yor game. Remember:<br><br>dx#=(x-EntityX())<br>dy#=(y-EntityY())<br>dz#=(z-EntityZ())	<br>l#=Sqr(dx*dx+dy*dy+dz*dz)<br>dx=dx/l<br>dy=dy/l<br>dz=dz/l<br>TranslateEntity e\mesh,dx,dy,dz<br><br>will be always faster!<br><br>If you don't know what this is for, draw a triangle and remember trigonometry.<br><br>5) the first thing you need to set-up is a decent gui, inventory system, and character abilities: strength, dexterity, intelligence, health, mana, xp points, how to level-up etc... Decide how it is going to work!, Interface and movement and point and click routines<br><br>6) MAKE USE OF THIS FORUMS, LEARN FROM THE COMMUNITY. SOME PEOPLE HERE ARE AWESOME MINDS! I've learned everything from people posting here, and sharing code archives. Here, there will be always an answer to your questions! This community is what makes blitz one of the best programming languages.<br><br>7) b3d rocks!<br><br>My RPG code isn't public domain. So I cannot offer you the original code, but if you want to contact me via this forum <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Thankyou for sharing your points. 1) yep, I agree 2) Yes, this can also be very helpful 3) Yeah, I agree until your bit about types, pointers &amp; arrays - arrays are certainly useful, however pointers &amp; types can wait a while 4) yep 5)Hmm, not so sure I concur here, I have extensively coded in B3D without physics engines to the extent of plotting projectiles arcs from a bloke running around in a 3D world and whilst that can be gratifying you cannot dismiss the physics engines out there - if anything JV-ODE invigorated my interest in B3D 6)Ohhh yes, and some 7)yep.  Thanks for your points on code dev Sagitario - I agree with your point about a structured approach - I'd just like to add that when developing your code you may find it useful to do incremental saves with a versioning number suffix within your filenames if you are not using a versioning tool - that way you can revert to a working version of your code without to much bother. <br><br>@Ross C, interesting point on the use of linepicks.<br><br>@ChrisNorris007:  Very very generous of you to share your code, like Russ said codebox with [] surrounding the 1st codebox &amp; [/] surropunding the last codebox will make the thread more readable and still allow folks to see your code.  <br><br>How is your modelling going in blender?
