You need to find a reasonable balance between the polycount of the water and the rest of your scene.<br><br>The real good looking water as seen in some top games or demos can't be done with the DirectX7 command set that is used by Blitz3D.<br><br>Personally I'd suggest to take fredborgs water example (see my link) and make it work for your purposes. Even when you need to learn some things about Blitz until you are able to extract the water parts from his demo and use it for your project, it's surely worth the time, especially since you, and even me can learn a lot from his code. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

A tsunami wave looks completely diffrent comparent to some small waves in a pot. Also, in the macro scale of drops the surface tension of water plays an important role, while the inertia of the mass defines the appearence in big scales.<br><br>Byside the physics of water, the way it affects light is also very complex. So when you're under water, other things under water look ok, but the world that is over the water level will look distorted. It's the same vica versa, when you watch some water from outside, the seaground is distorted. So Water with all it's individual depths due to waves and various ground levels is some kind of a megacomplex lense in eternal motion. you can calculate the distortion of each pixel, but it's a pretty intensive task that needs to consider the wave height, the ground level and the angle of view.<br><br>Additionally this mega-lense will of course also produce dynamic caustics, that's just a further factor that makes it hard to simulate it realiticly.<br><br>Using some fake fx will do the job imho. I wouldn't spend more than 5ms per frame for the water parts. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That trade-off looks to fall more on the side of the time-intensive factor rather than the quality side, meaning of course that we can only allow "x" amount of time due to frame-rates, etc, and whatever quality we can sneak in there will just have to do.<br><br>OPf course, this is where clever programming can "fake it" to make up the difference.  When DOOM first came out, the processors were a joke compared to the computing power we have under our hoods today, so to speak.  Yet, because they pre-computed just about everything, they got unbelievable (for then) performance and effects.<br><br>So, maybe we of this computer gen can look back to the earlier days to see what tricks we can find to prop up the quality for today's games. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Too many people just go and buy better hardware - 3 times every year. Doom was indeed very fast, I mean, it was fully playable on a 66 MHz machine - and absolutely amazing. In my memories it's a perfect 3D game, and when I run it these days then I'm shocked about the raw graphics, but hey once it just opened the door to a new world of computer games. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
