Looks scary :b<br>I do quite like SourceForge, but I'm not entirely sure how well a project like this, which requires non-free software to use, would do on there. It also has a very frightening interface.<br><br>-BerliOS looks cool. I'm not entirely fond of their web site, but it could be good.<br><br>-code.google.com I didn't know they actually hosted projects until just now. It looks neat and tidy... and we can trust the servers to be fast. 100 MB of storage, too!<br>The only problem so far is I have no idea what kind of rules they have. It looks like you can host anything there, but there's all this "Google-related code" stuff that confuses me. (Since it is never actually explained what "Google-related code" <i>is</i>).<br>Anyway, looks like one can just register a project in seconds with any popular license.<br><br>-I could host this on a quicky SVN repo of my own which I've set up. The connection is very slow and it could disconnect at any moment because it's working wirelessly via a very bad router... so it wouldn't work well.<br>To make that choice worse: I am too lazy to configure my SVN server, so it's very insecure and lets anonymous users play with files.<br>I have a few ideas at the ready to build an easy and completely web-based PHP-powered solution (so I can continue to avoid payed web hosting for now), but that would take a while and not work well.<br><br><br>A problem with almost all of these except the obvious worst choice: We'll need one of those complicated licenses. MIT, Lesser GPL and MPL are worth checking out...<br><br>What are your suggestions?<br>How should we go about sorting licensing? Also, it looks like a slight name / subtitle change should be done as well, to keep things coherent. (MiniB3d Unstable springs to mind).<br><br>Unfortunately, I'm afraid of forking or re-licensing anything, so someone else has to say it.<br><br>Simon, feel free to pop in and toss out any demands or 'Stop it!'s you want. <br>No pressure; I don't mind at all if you want to keep this small and I'm perfectly willing to drop the idea if you don't like it. It's your code, after all :)<br><br><br>Edit:<br>Here is a quickly written quick description of the project, by the way:<div class="quote"> Originally written by Simon Harrison, MiniB3d is a simple, native and cross-platform 3d engine written for BlitzMax. It features a naturally simple design similar to Blitz3d.<br><br>The project is open source and freely available, though only of real interest to users who own BlitzMax or those interested in 3d OpenGL engines. <br></div><br>Lacks a description of what BlitzMax or Blitz3d are, which I suppose is necessary. I did have something there like that in the description, but I didn't like it. (Must keep simple). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Better that, and have a single version, than 5 different versions with different tweaks.<br><br>So, to reflect your question: What exactly is it that you have against open source projects skid? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
