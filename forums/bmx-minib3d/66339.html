As has been said the nature of Wrapping means that even if you change to a different engine, or Max3d comes out, you will quite eserly slot the new engine into your project.<br><br>To explain more. The B3D commands that MiniB3D presents you with, are not the MiniB3D engine. These commands lie ontop of the type/Object definitions that Simonh has written. There is at least one other unofficial mode that also does this, and the first thing that will become available for Max3d when it comes out will almost certainly be a wrapper to make it look like B3d. (A sort of MiniMaxB3D if you will)<br><br>I never really understood this whole concept of encapsulation until I saw how simonH and Gman had basicly given me exactly the same commands but with totaly different base engines. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I think the "clunky" feeling is contributed to largely by the various automated things that shouldn't be automated, such as the "rotate this every frame" command and the "make me a camera that works like a first-person shooter camera" command which nobody in their right mind would use.<br><br>I imagine that with a bit more exploration I would have used it in the end, but that's the other thing: MiniB3D, as the name implies, is young and little. Because of that, it is really easy to understand because no nut has yet come along and contributed a broken 3DS loader.<br>(Unfortunately, that's the thing that hurt Irrlicht for me, though I understand that its file loading has much improved since my attempts).<br><br>I'll get back to the important difference: gg.Irrlicht is a wrapper, while MiniB3D is powered by the raw power of BlitzMax. (Also, it's easy to make changes to the core engine of MiniB3D, but to change anything other than the wrapper for something like gg.Irrlicht or SOW is extremely bothersome).<br>Also, Irrlicht is nicely cross-platform now but that cross-platformness isn't as tidy as with something built in straight BlitzMax. For example, in BlitzMax we can just move to a Mac and compile and it will run, while with Irrlicht we also need to acquire the Mac libraries for Irrlicht. (Not terrible, but worth noting).<br><br>Anyway, no intent to bash gg.Irrlicht here! Irrlicht is a fantastic engine, and there is definietly a difference in feature set. Irrlicht currently does a lot more and has existed for a lot longer (which doesn't hurt much either) :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So it is as complex as MiniB3D is.<br>Also Gman is at the moment working on IrrB3D to be a more complete B3D wrapper.<br><br>The Main point is that when MiniB3D and IrrB3d are finished they can be interchanged.<br><br>I agree totaly with Mr PussyCat, Irrlicht just doesnt feel like a BRL engine, whilst MiniB3d does, this is no reflection on Gman, because it works nearly exactly like it does in C++, to the point were you can follow the C++ Tutorials. However to say MiniB3D is soly powered by Bmax, hides the fact that it is useing the OPenGL commands, something a lot of people (well me) avoid.<br><br>If you want to help with an engine then MiniB3D is the one to help with. To the point that impixi posted bug the other day, and he and I were able to fix it ourselves within an hour, something I know I couldnt do with Irrlicht. However, if Gman lives up to his previous trackrecord then IrrB3D will be a contender in the Bmax 3d looking like B3D stakes.<br><br>The Basic point that Im taking a realy long time just to say again, is that IrrB3D will be a more complete wrapper before MiniB3D. Unless we all help with writing MiniB3D. This is because Gman only has to wrap an existing engine, whilst simonH has to write the commands, and then wrap them. However in the end they should have the same command set. Neither at the moment is complete, and they lack different stuff. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
