I was suspecting textures might be an issue, so I wrote a simple test program to observe memory usage.  I repeatedly load a 4096 by 4096 (that's the max for my graphics card) texture:<br><pre class=code>
Import Sidesign.MiniB3D

Graphics3D 800,600,1,2

Local testTexture:TTexture;

For Local i:Int = 0 Until 9999

testTexture = LoadTexture("name_of_texture.JPG");
Print "Test"
If (testTexture)
testTexture.FreeTexture();
EndIf

</pre><br><br>I ran this in multithreaded mode through gDEBugger, here's what I see.  The memory usage rises as it loads a few textures, then the garbage collector is triggered and it drops back down.  The problem is, each time it drops down, it doesn't drop down quite as far, and each time it goes up, it peaks a little bit higher.  Eventually, the program crashes when the process's virtual memory hits about 1.7 GB and the working set hits about 1.5 GB.<br><br>Why am I seeing this leak?<br><br>If I comment out the "Graphics3D 800,600,1,2", the memory usage still oscillates, but eventually settles into a pattern and never goes past a certain peak.<br><br>If I leave the Graphics3D in, but replace the load/free code with a delay, I don't see any leaks, so its not like Graphics3D is causing a leak just because it was created.<br><br>Any ideas of what's going on here?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Jason <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I use <a href="http://blog.orbmu2k.de/sidebar-gadgets/top-five-sidebar-gadget" target="_blank">Orbmu2k's Top 5 Gadget</a> in Windows 7 to notice the changes. Something is eating up the RAM constantly, perhaps 1MB per second (minib3d is only rendering the finished planet in my planet creator) and sometimes the RAM frees some 100/200MB without any action from my side. If I compile the source without threading the leak is gone. Very strange. Oh, and I don't use threads, yet.

Stuff is made but for some reason isn't cleared. It only happened in the multithreaded GC and I could never narrow down exactly what it was. The problem is that *most* stuff is handled, but not everything... and I haven't a clue why some things slip through the cracks. It would be one thing if it happened in the single threaded collector as well, but that seems fine, which leads me to believe it's a problem with the collector and not specific modules (this is just a theory but, flip a switch and problems start, the switch might have something to do with it...)<br><br>The nearest I could figure was that some things that try to get freed are locked, so the free can't happen, but they are discarded anyway so then there's no reference, hence the leak. My solution was to disable the garbage collector and manually tell it to collect when I knew threads weren't doing anything. I don't think it solved the issue entirely, and certainly did nothing to get to the root of the problem, but it has been working for me. I suspect the leaking things are thread specific, not MiniB3D things, but again, that's just a theory.<br><br>I think there's either a problem with the multithreaded collector, that it thinks it's cleaned things up when it actually hasn't, drops the reference and therefore leaks them, OR theres a leak in the threading system itself, as, again, things don't leak without threading enabled. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
