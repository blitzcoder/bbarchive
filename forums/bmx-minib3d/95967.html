The OpenGL SuperBible talks about how if you use glMultiDrawElements instead of glDrawElements, you can render large amounts of triangles with fewer calls/OpenGL state changes. This sounded like a typical scalar-to-vector code optimization and I was excited to tweak MiniB3D to see if this would help. However, I got stumped when trying to support the case of VBOs being used with glMultiDrawElements.<br><br>The original code reads as follows (in TMesh.bmx):<br><br><pre class=code>
	
			' draw tris
			
			glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW)

			glPushMatrix()
	
			If TSprite(Self)=Null
				glMultMatrixf(mat.grid)
			Else
				glMultMatrixf(mat_sp.grid)
			EndIf
					
			If vbo																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																
				glDrawElements(GL_TRIANGLES,surf.no_tris*3,GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT,Null)
			Else
				glDrawElements(GL_TRIANGLES,surf.no_tris*3,GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT,surf.tris)
			EndIf

			glPopMatrix()

Local U#,V#
Local Row = 4
Local Column = 4
Local numRows = 4
Local numColumns

For [all vertices in this quad] {

	U = VertexU(surf,index) / numColumns
	V = VertexV(surf,index) / numRows

	'Add offsets so we go from texture-space to atlas-space:	
	VertexTexCoords( surf, index, U + (Column/numColumns), V + (Row/numRows) )

You can look at the TMesh.Update() method's source: it goes through every surface of the TMesh, rendering it. If you have only 1 surface, that's just one drawcall.<br><br>Another element that can help you a lot is using shader programs.

I see that Gman provides a great BlitzMax mod for Irrlicht, and even a supposed B3D API mapping. In practice, do you know how successful this API port is? If it's the kind of thing that has been proven to easily map over and behave in the same way, then that would be pretty awesome. If not, switching engines/APIs at this point would set us back too much. I'll have to dig around to see what kind of success people have had with Irrlicht-B3D. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Make sure the landscape is static, no moving parts. Coding-wise, what I did was to load an individual mesh asset, then CopyMesh() and AddMesh(). AddMesh() combines duplicate surfaces automagically, reducing overhead. Now this single object is not subject to camera culling, but reduces loop overhead and combined with a texture atlas should be pretty swift in the rendering.<br><br><pre class=code>
levelmap:TMesh = CreateMesh()
levelmap.positionentity(0,0,0)

''....some level loading stuff here....

If map[x]  = 121 Then meshToAdd=Copymesh(wall_nernie, levelmap)
PaintSurfaceMesh(meshToAdd, 1, brush )
meshtoAdd.PositionMesh( (x)*mapsize,0,(-r)*mapsize)
meshtoAdd.AddMesh(levelmap)
meshtoAdd.PositionMesh( -(x)*mapsize,0,(r)*mapsize) ''reset the position of the original mesh to be used again
</pre><br><br>- you speak of being able to move parts (separate entities) from a single mesh, which is what i demonstrate here:<br><a href="http://blitzmax.com/Community/posts.php?topic=94160" target="_blank">http://blitzmax.com/Community/posts.php?topic=94160</a><br><br><br><br>- the other two big improvements for miniB3d would be batching sprites together (providing they're in the same layer or z-depth) and camera culling using octrees. Culling right now in EntityInFrustrum() (TCamera.bmx) does a lot of calculations per frame PER OBJECT. So yeah, some sort of octree would help.<br><br><br>Other optimizations:<br>Light and shade your objects using textures, and use OpenGL flat-lighting.<br><br>Use mipmaps for distant scenery/ objects.<br><br>I made a bunch of optimizations to my version of miniB3d, but mostly I converted FOR-EACHIN-NEXT loops to use arrays instead. I did this in the main TMesh.bmx Update() and Alpha() methods since those were hit every frame.<br><br>Another small optimization I did for the Method EntityInFrustum#(ent:TEntity) is to unroll the for-next loop within it.<br><br>And lastly,under TCamera.bmx, the ExtractFrustrum() method instead of multiplying those two matricies I let opengl do it for me:<br><textarea class=codebox name="code" wrap=OFF readonly="true" rows="15" cols="80">

This is where AddMesh() comes into play. You can have one MASSIVE model with various surfaces, and it will do the batching for you. But you lose object culling, so it's sending all these VBO's to your gfx card, which is overhead (10 million triangles = 30 million points * 2 uvs, you get the idea). That's why I say keep it static, because the VBO's should be sent ONCE, then the graphics card will keep that data in its memory and you don't have to worry about it if you're only moving the camera.<br><br>If you're smart with the AddMesh() you can break up massive terrain into chunks, so the frustrum culling takes care of chunks we don't see.<br><br>Now when I say static, that means no animating bones. There is a way (but not currently implemented in miniB3D) to batch moving, scaling, rotating objects together that share the same surface texture but different positions. This is what Charlie (jkrankie) did with miniB3D sprite batching.<br><a href="http://blitzmax.com/Community/posts.php?topic=90420#1028446" target="_blank">http://blitzmax.com/Community/posts.php?topic=90420#1028446</a><br><br>Now to throw a wrench into all this, is semi-transparency. miniB3D organizes the drawing sequence for alpha-ed objects from back to front. So if you start using glass or semi-transparent surfaces or fading of objects, well, now things get complicated since it needs to be ordered.<br>Luckily, most of the ordered situations are taken care of, but once in a while you'll encounter weird problems, so you'd have to force objects to be in the ordering with the alpha-ed objects by setting the EntityFX(32), force alpha-blending flag.<br><br>So therefore, keep semi-transparent objects and textures separate from the massive, static landscape.<br><br><br>Link on OpenGL culling:<br><a href="http://www.sjbaker.org/steve/omniv/frustcull.html" target="_blank">http://www.sjbaker.org/steve/omniv/frustcull.html</a><br><br>Link on texture/object batching in Unity, but good explanation:<br><a href="http://unity3d.com/support/documentation/Manual/iphone-DrawCall-Batching.html" target="_blank">http://unity3d.com/support/documentation/Manual/iphone-DrawCall-Batching.html</a><br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I have yet to find any good tutorials on it, but a GPU solution seems like the way to go. Yes, there will be some concurrency issues in that the GPU and CPU operate asynchronously (e.g. all the occlusion queries will be based upon the previous -- not current -- frame), but as long as framerate stays high enough, these artifacts shouldn't be too big of a deal.<br><br>Has anyone checked this out yet? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Most open areas don't need this.<br><br>Also know that many graphic cards come with a feature called "Early-Z"; this does an occlusion test and discards fragments that are covered by others. This feature is not something you turn on, it's just 'there'.<br>If you manually output fragment depth in your pixel shader, it will be disabled (since the hardware needs to run the pixel shader to know what the depth will be).<br><br>If you're having doubts on what to implement, there is a better way.<br>Start developing your game concurrently with the game-engine, having 'necessity' dictate what should be implemented. <br>This way you are always on par with existing bottlenecks and whatever implementations are necessary to keep the target framerate, without risking bloating the engine with a list of optimizations you thought of beforehand. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
