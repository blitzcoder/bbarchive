I have no idea how fast/slow that would be or if there's just a mathmatical way I could more easily figure it out without having to move a bunch of pivots every frame to have them calc my positions for me... seems wastefull as they will move when you move the camera, then they'll move again when you correct their positon... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

AudioDrivers() returns a list of 5 zeros which leads me to believe it's my problem not blitz... My SetChannelDepth() doesn't seem to do anything and it worked about a month ago (last time I was tinkering with audio)... maybe I installed a wierd driver and forgot about it.<br><br>Also where can I get your release of minib3d klepto?
