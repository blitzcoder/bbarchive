I'm not sure cross-compatibility with Linux is a reasonable expectation when you take into account the myriad varieties and the size of the development team (ie Simon), but you mentioned Ubuntu specifically and it's specifically Ubuntu that has caused a couple of us grief. So I'm just letting you know, because I got a little ways into development before the segmentation faults started appearing.<br><br>Also, when I say "it" doesn't render right on OSX I mean The King Is Dead doesn't render right right. TKID does some avant garde stuff which, while it technically should work identically on OSX, most projects probably won't miss. I don't want to give the impression that MiniB3D is hopelessly broken on OSX because it isn't, but I'd suggest you develop on Windows in the same kinda way that it's sensible to develop a website against Firefox rather than IE. (Rationale: You want to write for a platform that behaves <u>as expected</u>, otherwise your primary code-base becomes a kludge with a shelf-life -- that being the length of time it takes for the platform to get fixed.)<br><br><div class="quote"> Well, did anyone actually care to find the source of the error by testing out? <br></div>The flippant answer to that would be "not my job" but the truth is I'd merrily hunt down the problem if I had the time and expertise (I have neither!) Until someone comes along who does, the pragmatic thing to do regarding Ubuntu is advise caution. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
