And TMD2Loader? thats the name of a subprogram, not a type. All the fields except Mesh stop existing after creation. Either extend Mesh or just put the whole thing into tmesh.LoadMD2 and make the fields local variables instead.<br><br>So anyway, I've exagerated my dislike of Kleptos code, so I can make a point, which is, what happens If for example I make the changes I want to Kleptos code, (which Im going to do).

At this time, there is probably little point.<br><br><br>I also see what you mean about the MD2 loader...<br>I was about to start a discussion (for what it's worth at this point in time :b) about Extensions, and how it will become tempting to add features that sometimes don't quite fit in smoothly to the design.<br>I've noticed with Irrlicht, for example, that things look horribly messy when there are strange debug tools lying around in the source code, such as automatic FPS cameras which nobody in their right mind would use in an end product (and which are not hard to create!).<br>If somebody wanted to add a debug tools thing to MiniB3d, it could be added as an optional Include following some kind of convention.<br>The same sort of convention could be done with the MD2 loader; a particular extension could add itself (via function pointers, perhaps?) to a list of Loaders and called cleanly/automatically, but only if the extension has been enabled.<br>Adding to that (I am obsessed with soft-coding), some Extensions could be included by default for simplicity and symmetry. (All file loaders as Extensions).<br><br>This probably has a speed hit, but also a big boost to the "Ooh, neat code!" thing and it improves the scalability or whatever.<br><br>Edit:<br>Okay, Simon, I've changed all my "3d"s to "3D"s :b<br><br>Edit:<br><a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/minib3d-discussion/browse_frm/thread/e6115e88d745fee2/" target="_blank">Here is that discussion...</a><br>The idea actually is a lot like my own recent fiddlings in stuff, so I will try my hand at it; I'm already sort of in the mode for Extension System building. (Although the most recent thing has been converting my beautiful PHP 5 to PHP 4 with Magic Quotes <i>on</i>, so my morale is a bit low and my code may look awful now that I've become resigned to the disgusting PHP 4 glurk). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

At the beginnig I was thinking of a generic ModelLoader which could be extend to all kinds of loaders. In fact I have choosed a different way. But I mainly use Types to integrate things like complex functions as one type (for me it raises the readability) but feel free to change it to your prefers.<br><br>The rest of the MD2Loader is mainly integrated as the rest of miniB3D. Also the really long array wasn't in the type just because it was added later (these values represent precalculated Normals). And the main problem for me was to get midpoint of reintegration if a new update of SimonH is available and the complete confomation with SimonHs code.<br><br>Also the filesplitting was just a beginning, maybe you have noticed, that it just uses include, what is in my point of view the false way (because of the long compilation times). With time my goal in this case is to change the whole code to have an import structure so that really only the files are recompiled when needed.<br><br>BTW: I think there is no need of two different Versions (mine and H&amp;K). We could add the best of all this Versions (maybe my Version as a prototype) and then make up one new one.<br><br>And at least, maybe you should know that all my additions were made with no idea when SimonH will publish a new Version. So all of this is just a 'hack' into MiniB3D and should show what all is possible with this Engine.<br><br>Cheers klepto2 <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

BLIde froze :( -- sooner rather than later.<br><br>One question so far:<br>You've added a new field to TMesh called md2_surfaces and a new function to retrieve them. The function to get them looks identical to the old one, though, except that surf_list is changed to md2_surfaces.<br>So, I wonder... what is the difference between the regular surf_list and md2_surfaces?<br>Do you think it is possible to get an md2 surface working like a regular surface early on? (I am hoping to keep the Extensions as simple as possible; just a single function needing to be customized aside from those called directly by the user).<br><br><br><br>On the topic of changing stuff, does anyone know a free SVN client that doesn't stink of bugs?<br>I've tried a few, but they all have failed in some way. One of them, in fact, did that odd disappearing into thin air act when I tried simply to connect to an SVN server (and I tried it on two SVN servers on two different operating systems / computers!).<br>SmartSVN is good and has a free version, but it requires me to pay if I want a full feature set.<br><br>Tortoise SVN is probably decent (I liked Tortois CVS, so their SVN software probably won't disappoint), but I've never been fond of adding extensions to Explorer so it's not my preferred solution unless they have built an alternate version that works entirely on its own. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
