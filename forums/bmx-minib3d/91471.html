Very very strong (ask some of my programming buddies the rants I would go on). . . that is until I loaded up my Amiga 500 and popped in my Imagine 1.0 disk and remembered what it was when I was first playing with 3D modeling as a kid. There are lots of great videos to learn it and with 2.49b and now 2.5 it is much much improved since I first tried the 2.3 series. Very quickly once I remembered that UI behavior wasn't always what I take it for now it was pretty easy to learn with some good tutorial videos. I can suggest many sites. The only changes I make now to the default settings are changing to have the left mouse button select instead of right (never got used to it) and change the camera rotation from trackball to turntable as trackball was too unpredictable for me. You don't have to know every hotkey for everything to do anything as you did two or three years ago and the layout is much more consistent than it was.<br><br>The Blender Blitz3D export script was available from <a href="http://www.gandaldf.com/" target="_blank">http://www.gandaldf.com/</a> but it appears to be down now. I have a backup if you would like me to send it to you (or anybody else). I also saved the how to use documentation from the page.<br><br>I believe it is only compatible 2.4x series as Blender 2.5 has a completely re-written python API, so somebody would have to do a lot of work to get it working again.<br><br>I used to use Wings3D to model but it will never see animation tools so unless the models you want to use are static you would need to import to another tool to rig and animate. It's very easy with some sweet editing tool though. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

And there's milkshape.<br><br>The only free tool I can think of that exports b3d files is characterFX, but the b3d files it generates aren't the best. Still, it's free so maybe you should try that first and see if it'll do for your needs. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I would say UU3D is worth the money though, even with only playing with a demo of it. But again, I like free so I'll take the lumps that go with it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I ended up being totally overwhelmed. In hindsight the mistake I made was trying to dive right in and expecting Blender to work similar to other modelers. <br><br>This go around I decided to give it a fair(er) shot so I watched a few tutorials (of varying degrees of difficulty), kept a handy keyboard reference sheet nearby and just tinkered around without any expectations. Surprisingly I've found myself loving it more and more, so much so that I've retired Milkshape altogether. It really is a powerful piece of software. I'm using it now not only to do modeling, animation and texturing but also as a level editor. It's just really simplified my art pipeline.<br><br>The only problem I see at the moment is the .b3d exporter is no longer being supported so it's falling behind the Blender versions. I'd love to see someone take up the task of getting a .b3d exporter working for Blender 2.5. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
