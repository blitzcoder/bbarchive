The higher your reviews (once you get reviews) the better it sells. I would second jhocking on recommending you send out as many promo codes as you can find places that will take them. Give them to your friends and family and have them post reviews to get a rating started. You may want to look into open feint integration or a home spun twitter/facebook post feature, it's scary how much people love pointless social networking posts... it makes me sad but it works.<br><br>Also you can get some add space on some of the iphone game review sites pretty cheap if you're willing/able. Or you can look at getting some adds through admob or one of the other iPhone in app advertisers. The conversion rates can be pretty good there. I have 1 ad supported app that fills empty adds with adds for my other apps and it's gotten a decent return and doesn't cost anything since they would just be blank adds otherwise.<br><br>Really it boils down to exposure = sales = more exposure/word of mouth = more sales. So encouraging people to spread the word is key.<br><br>Also after it's been up for a week or so drop the price for a day or 2 and it will get picked up by things like appminer, and people will buy it because it's on sale, thus getting exposure so more people buy it when it goes back to the regular price...<br><br>Frequent updates (but not bombing with trivial things), like 1 a month or so helps bump it towards the top of the recent release lists for some free eyeballs. If you spam updates though bad things happen (delays on acceptance, getting bumped from new release lists all together etc...) so try to trickle your features out rather than giant updates.<br><br>Also I think you're probably caught in the iPad crush, everyone and their mother is trying to get their iPad version out at or around launch to cash in, but that means there's too many apps, and not enough iPads sold yet. Lots of people are holding off for the 3G so there should be a second wave of users when that launches with fewer apps getting dumped on the store at exactly the same time.<br><br>You might consider making it iPhone/iPad hybrid unless there's a reason it can only run on iPad since there's about a zillion iPhone's out there to each iPad right now... Plus it's a much easier sell to people who do or will own both, even if it's limited to 3Gs. Dunno how your physics affect it, but I was getting great framerates back with 0.2beta on my 1st gen iPhone when I was testing so you could open a big door there.<br><br>You'll have my cash in hand as soon as my iPad arrives, first purchase on device I promise :0) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So you can introduce an app at $5, discount it to $1 for a week to get sniffed by the automated watchers as an introductory price, then bump it back up. If you introduce it at $1 then bump it you get no exposure because the price never drops... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
