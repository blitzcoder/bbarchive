They are both trying to do the same thing, that is provide b3d commands in Bmax. Yet loads of space seems to be dedicated to MiniB3D, and none to Ib3d.<br>1) Ib3d supports DX9 and 8, Open Gl, and Two software renders<br>2) On comparitive tests Seems to have more comparible speed to B3d<br>3) Actualy has the entity list ready done.<br><br>The source is there, maybe Gman hasnt, (or has), declared it open, but even in the state it is right now it works quite well. And if you want to add more things you have all of irrlicht to chose from.<br>I admit Ive only just started to look at it, and so may have missed some flaws, but I cannot see any. When the Gman has finished the wrapper for the new irrlicht release, I would recomend to everyone who isnt a MAC user to download it and see for yourself.<br><br>Infact, download it now. It is well worth a look <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I also much much preffer the way you have done the Types, which I normaly directly access rather than use the functions.<br><br>What I wanted to do was show that there was another "Blitz3d" engine for Bmax. And when it comes down to it, the nature of the commands being the same, means that you can drop either "Engine" directly into your project <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
