I moved a few weeks ago from Blitz3D to Blitzmax+minib3d and it works - I ported two of my projects successfully. If you already know how to program with Blitzmax I would suggest minib3d first - if this is not sufficient enough for you move on to a more advanced Module (like Xors3D).<br><br>Blitz3D is still unbeaten if you want a very quick visualization of an 3D scene and gets updates from time to time (but isn't developed further anymore as it seems). I'm not *very* happy with minib3d as a substitute for Blitz3D but I can work with it. There are some limitations (missing functions), I think it is slower and the author stopped working on it (but you can enhance it to your own version of minib3d as the source is available).<br><br>Here my two demos: <a href="/posts.php?topic=95855" target="_blank">Blue Marble</a> and <a href="/posts.php?topic=95979" target="_blank">MaxSky</a><br><br>Blue Marble uses the 0.53 minib3d without any additions and MaxSky a modified version due rotation issues with the 0.53 vanilla edition. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you're totally new to 3D programming you would likely benefit by getting your feet wet in something simpler first to get the fundamentals down before you start adding in layers of complexity to do things you don't understand yet :0) I like to start at the bottom and work up... sometimes I find the bottom is all I need. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Undoubtedly you end up hitting a point where you need to improve it, but I've found that since it was so simple to begin with, improving it seems a lot more doable as it's not a massive codebase---you can easily read through all the source in an hour or so.<br><br>It sounds like we could probably all benefit from each other by "joining forces" or whatever and formally continuing MiniB3D. Adam and ima747 have all done great stuff w/ it, I have a (small) team working on improving it as well, and I'm sure there are others --- I wouldn't be surprised if we eventually took MiniB3D beyond where Blitz3D was, while maintaining the core simplistic roots that seems to have attracted everybody in the first place.<br><br>I'm not too experienced with how these community-style projects gain momentum (or if this has been tried many times in the past and failed), but as someone who has used Ogre, Irrlict, Unity, Torque, and others (all on the Mac, and all of which are great for their own reasons...maybe not so much Torque haha) --- at the end of the day MiniB3D was dead simple and to me was worth the time spent in any additions I'd have to make to it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
