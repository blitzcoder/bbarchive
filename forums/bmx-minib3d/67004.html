Now I hopefully will have the chance to do a new big project for which they want an animation/walkthrough. I used to work with Quest3D, but all this visual noding becomes very complex, so I was wondering if it could be done  with BMax/MiniB3D?.<br>Does anybody have any experience with highpoly scenes full of  textures and lightmaps with MiniB3D. I guess bugs shouldn't be such a problem since the developer always hang around here :)<br>Such nice things as bump-mapping or antialiasing doesn't seem to be implementable in the near future? I would work with xsi, don't know if Giles would be of any help?<br><br>Would be glad for any tips&amp;tricks&amp;ideas/opinions etc...<br><br>Thanks <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This will help answer your questions. (Ooops sorry I see you use XSI - maybe somebody with experience with XSI can help, but I suggest you try exporting to a fairly standard format like .X or possibly .3DS for levels).<br><br>Also Giles is an excellent program for lightmapping a .b3d (or .ase, .3ds, .x, etc.) file.  You just load in your model and place lights, render and save to .b3d format.<br><br>The lightmaps that you can make in Giles are superior (more optimised, easier to adjust) and more suitable for blitz3d than most commercial products.<br><br>So XSI -&gt; Giles -&gt; Bmax/MiniB3D (LoadAnimMesh command) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Works like a charm. But my question is more towards if anybody actually DID a complex walkthrough, and if MiniB3D is powerful enough to handle all these polygons. Quest3D for example can handle up to 3.500.000 polygons with 30fps. If it were for fun I would try it with MiniB3D but investing much time and failing due to technical problems wouldn't be good. Have a look at Quest3d.com to see how it works, many many channels, easy to begin, complicated and complex after a while. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Normally I should take the time to do a complete test with an old project within MiniB3D, but I fear that I don't have enough time budget for this. Either I do it with one or the other. MiniB3D is what I would prefer, because I could use the gained knowledge and experience for future projects (and quest updates cost ~ 400€) Sure it's great, but every update costs the same or more and the new version  is due in 5-6 months. Unfortunately I can't wait so long. But if I don't see any positive responses before I have to send my calculations I will have to go the secure way with Quest3D. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That should wrap it up :)<br><div class="quote"> <br>Yes. Why not try it?<br> <br></div><br>Which I did :) I loaded up a recent model of a buidling with 40.000 polygons and it was much smoother and faster than with Quest3D. Only problem were transparent faces. In Objects, which contain both opaque and half-transparent faces, the opaque faces showed at 100% through the semi-transparent faces. Neither any color nor transparency value of the transparent faces were considered. Only the other objects, not belonging to the first, rendered up correctly. Is this an OpenGl problem? Quest which renders with DirectX doesn't show this behavior. Or is this a bug? Of course I could export all transparent faces apart, but I would prefer exporting/importing object wise.<br><br>Another question, is antialiasing impossible right now? Any chances of having bump-mapping? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Leadwerks posted some OpenGL code in the modules board months ago for general OpenGL AA :)<br><br>Alpha: This is actually simply because you break "rule 1". Never mix alpha and non alpha in a single multi planar object unless you want to have trouble. Because to sort rendering problems you have to split alpha and non alpha, which is what Quest3D most likely does when loading the model. This is most likely the reason it is slower because depending on the model, this ends as a dozen or a few hundred meshes.<br><br>Better split the model up before loading it and then load it as anim mesh. This will solve some problems and most likely take care of some problems as well. (only some because I don't think alpha sorting is in now. it works as it worked in Blitz3D ... which didn't have a seperate alpha render pass as well and thus would show a similar error if you try to break all game modelling rules I fear) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
