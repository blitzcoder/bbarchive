For testing purposes I exported a model with mocap animation from XSI to Unwrap.  The only and most decent way to have the animation exported correctly was by using the x format. So after some tweaking the model looked great and was animated perfectly within Unwrap. Now I exported it  as b3d file and tried it in MiniB3D but I got a bone error. I reexported it as multimesh, to discard the bones and it looked fine, but without animation.<br><br>So does any xsi user have an idea what could be the problem??<br><br>Other thing, I tried reimporting the b3d file in Unwrap and first it looked ok, but when playing the animation the feet behaved weird. So I reopened the correct unwrap file and resaved as x file, loaded this one and it was fine. Then saved as b3d again and... bones error in miniB3D and play error in Unwrap... hmmmmm dunno, do the bones have to be a certain way for b3d to work??<br><br>Thanks for sharing your experience.<br><br>Any ideas?<br><br>*-*<br>Edit:<br><br>I loaded a x model (the dwarf) from the Irrlicht Demo and the bones looked much better in Unwrap3D. The created b3d file worked fine in minib3d too. Sooooo it's XSI, hmmmm. I tried dotxsi export but the animation was faulty, but the bones always looked alike...Will have to check another model. I tried the red_jaquaia model and simply draged a mocap over for testing purposes, seems to be the wrong way. Any xsi guys here with a proven workflow?<br><br>*-* Edit2:<br><br>ok, I finally got it, dotxsi isn't suited. Only for statics. Don't know if it's the new Unwrap exporter which is still beta or the xsi exporter. <br>Exporting with is fine as long as one has selected SRT as animation type and Plot Ik to FK. I didn't have SRT, I used the default Matirx unfofrtunately ;)<br><br>Hey the bird demo is funny with a flying character, but I got a drop from 60 fps to 20 fps ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
