PhysX is a good point but I believe noone would have an advantage if we would implement a buildin for Speedtree/Speed grass because I believe the main blitzers simply don't have that much money for these engines (Speedtree license costs $8,495 per application) and without the source I think it is nearly impossible to implement this.<br><br>[Edit]<br>As far as I know a Unit Test system is not bind to a 3D Engine not needed in minib3d only.
