Having never used Blitz3D before, I'm not exactly sure how everything is supposed to work, but I've been figuring things out little by little.<br><br>So far I've been able to load static .b3d models and their textures fine. Animated models is another issue though. I went to Psionic's website and downloaded the ninja and dwarf models. Those animated just fine in the engine when I threw them in the "anim.bmx" example that comes with minib3d.<br><br>Getting excited that I could finally do animated meshes in minib3d, I went out and purchased two animated character packs:<br><br>1. 3DRT's Female Character models (.b3d format)<br><br>2. Dexsoft's Anime Female character models (.b3d)<br><br>Neither of them work ideally when imported into BlitzMax, but they each behave differently.  Here's how:<br><br>1. 3DRT<br><br>The model loads in the "anim.bmx" example but refuses to animate. Absolutely zero movement occurs, despite the fact that apparently the model is chock full of animations (also, this one causes things to load slowly . I'm not sure if its due to its poly count ~2800 or sthg else)<br><br>2. Drexsoft<br><br>This model loads in the "anim.bmx" example, looks good, until you start animating. It does indeed animate, but it completely distorts the geometry of the model, morphing her into some kind of weird stretched out looking thing. Increasing the 'anim time' makes it more messed up, decreasing it brings it back to normal.<br><br>I really don't know what is going on. The dwarf and ninja loaded just fine into the anim.bmx example, and all of their animations played back normally. The models I actually dropped money on don't work, and I don't have the 3D chops to pull it into Blender and inspect what's up (hence me buying pre-made models).<br><br>If anyone has any ideas about how to get these models working, I'd be greatly appreciative. I've included links to the .b3d files (but without the textures as my intention is not to freely distribute these commercial models---just to get some help on this animation glitch). If someone could try these out for themselves and see if it works for them, that would be really helpful. At this point I'm at a loss of what to do next. I'm not sure if its ExtractAnimSeq that I need to use, or SetAnimTime, or just plain ol' "animate".<br><br>Help?<br><br>Links:<br><br>1) <a href="http://www.cyluz.com/minib3d/female_anim.b3d" target="_blank">http://www.cyluz.com/minib3d/female_anim.b3d</a><br>2) <a href="http://www.cyluz.com/minib3d/blondie1.b3d" target="_blank">http://www.cyluz.com/minib3d/blondie1.b3d</a><br><br>a.

I just do everything in blender so I don't recall the names of the various other programs that can work with b3d files...). This could in theory be as simple as load and re-save... this also might be possible for someone to do with blitz3d. If you can open it with blitz you should be able to re-save it as a b3d from blitz, which should then (in theory) be more compliant with minib3d... someone might be able to punch up a "fixer" program...<br><br>If it's possible to contact the file's creator's you could also ask them to export again for you as it could be just problems with older versions of exporter plugins they may have been using when creating the models. If they're really nice, or you have access to other formats of the same model under your purchase license you may be able to open the models yourself in blender or another program and export, again this might help though it will depend on the model, the format, and what is happening in the animation (as slotman mentioned, they may have done something to the model in it's animation process that isn't compatible with the b3d format, or the minib3d .b3d loader etc.) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
