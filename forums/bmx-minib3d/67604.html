The differences are noted in the readme.txt file of the download.<br><br>The most obvious difference is that it uses OpenGL instead of Direct3D. This allows it to be cross platform (Blitz3D is windows only)<br><br><br>when you install the miniB3D module and build mods. the help docs are generated. <br>alternatively, the online Blitz3D docs will help as well.<br><br>simonh has stated (somewhere) that a goal for minib3d is to support as wide a number of end user systems as possible (along the lines of the Blitz3D directx7 footprint) which leads us to...<br><br>Klepto2's extended miniB3D module<br>user Klepto2 has extended miniB3D to support more modern hardware and features.<br><br>Notably<br>1. It Adds support for shaders using GLSL (Open GL Shading Language)<br>2. Adds support for VBO's (Vertex Buffer Objects) that can improve render speeds.<br><br>also, Klepto2 is working on a cross-platform module for Newton Game Dynamics that will add physics support to mini-b3d.<br><br>all in all, I have been extremely impressed by simonh and Klepto2's work. I was initially reluctant to invest my (very limited) time into what I saw as 3rd party, inferior stopgap before Max3D was released.  How wrong I was!! I see the project as a full-fledged 3D solution for BlitzMax. It is stable and does what I expect it to do. Simon and Klepto are extremely helpful and diligent. (Mark Sibly seems to be supporting miniB3D as well by offering code fixes/optimizations and overall BRL support) <br><br>I was able to knock up a full Object Oriented 3D game prototype in about 3 days (part time) and I would call my programming skills 'medium'. I am not a professional programmer(I know that is obvious to most of you :) ) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Simon has done a brilliant job, and for many (most?) 3d apps it will do the job, but there are some cases where it may not perform as hoped. <br><br>There are two issues that are preventing me from utilising MiniB3d at this stage.<br><br>1.	Collisions. I’m not seeing decent performance when incorporating moving objects. Example: I have a flat landscape of trees, and moving projectiles, all collideable – speed noticeably stutters. Equivalent Blitz3D code does not exhibit this problem. Perhaps I’m not properly utilising octrees? <br><br>2.	BlitzMax 2D commands cannot be mixed with MiniB3D. I’m aware of Klepto2’s RenderWorld modification and I <b>was</b> using it, but it does not seem to work in MiniB3D 0.41. I’m also aware that you can use Sprites for some 2d operations (eg simulate a HUD, etc), but I have yet to test this. Could I implement a 2d overhead map that updates in real-time, or status bars, etc? Would there be significant performance tradeoffs? I need to investigate this further.<br><br>Anyhow, they are the issues I’m facing with MiniB3d at the moment.
