I've had my go at a 3D engine and I had a basic foundation, but it wasnt anything compared to this. I'm not really programming inclined anymore, I mean, I like to play around with some cool little fx and demo's -- but developing stuff is too time consuming for me -- especially while doing shiftwork. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
