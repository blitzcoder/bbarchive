Maybe I can help you with your decision on some critical factors, which I could slightly break it down for you. Of course, these are engines which are open source and with a very loose license aka MIT/BSD.<br><br><b>User base</b><br>Torque, Ogre and Irrlicht wins this one hands down. Panda3D is also C++ but mostly active users use python. Torque uses TorqueScript which has C++ syntax but you can always go full C++.<br><br><b>Active Dev Team</b><br>Torque3D and Ogre.<br><br><b>Active Forums/Tutorials/Youtube</b><br>Torque, Ogre and Irrlicht wins this one again. Check the number of post/help DAILY.<br><br><b>Known Games </b><br>Torque3D (Life is Feudal, BeamNG)<br>Ogre3D (Zombie Driver, Torchlight 1 &amp; 2, Open MorrowWind Project, Scrap Mechanic)<br>Irrlicht (Build A World)<br><br><b>Pure C++</b><br>Ogre3D<br><br>I'd lean more towards Ogre3D and Torque3D since they are constantly updating, which btw both now supports Physically Based Rendering. Panda3D also has one but it's only a mod and not official. Irrlicht and Ogre already has support for mobile devices like Android but still experimental.<br><br>Some will argue that Ogre3D is only a renderer but with a ton of user contributions listed in their wiki, you can piece it together and make a game. ie. Input/Sound. All graphics feature are already supported one form or another like scene management, occlusion, lod, etc, hardware instancing. The only problem with Ogre is you can't rely on default shaders that comes with the SDK/examples because it's all over the place and messy, you have to build your own.<br><br>I'm not a big fan of these engines but have used them for quite some time and based on statistics alone and the track record, all of them are proven tech throughout the years.<br><br>BUT if you like the modern ones, C++ support, fully opensource with a Unity3D Feel, just go straight to GoDot or Urho3D. ;-)<br><br>Still, don't take my word for it. Investigate and have a look around on their respective forums, demos, mods, ask questions and there you go! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
