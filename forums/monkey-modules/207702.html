After learning some tricks with opengl.gles11 in Mojo, I decided to revisit my old nDrawExts module and give it a makeover with less external dependencies.  The result is nDrawExts2.  <br><br><img src="https://raw.github.com/nobuyukinyuu/nDrawExts2/master/preview.png"><br><br>Along with the previous version's features, the new version can compile to Android and supports a feature many people have been wanting:  Full alpha pixel data support.  You can take a whole image and load it into an array ready for WritePixels, or you can take slices of an image for faster processing.  Writing this was a necessary first step for another future library, so this should be a nice start for those of you who liked the earlier version but felt it was lacking in features/portability.  In the demo you can see it being used to shift the hue of the flame sprite - but you could use it for palette shifts, character compositing, or anything you can think of really.<br><br>In addition to this new feature, the previous features are still available -- extra blending modes, special Logic Operator blend modes (potentially faster!), and, of course, full access to the Stencil Buffer.  Thanks in part to some changes to Monkey in the past few months, it's possible to re-initialize the surface with stencil buffer support without having to hack Mojo's natives.  Of course, it would be nice for Mark to simply initialize the surface with 8 stencil bits instead of 0, since 0 doesn't guarantee there will <i>be</i> a stencil buffer, but at least we can make it work on all systems without a problem now :)<br><br>Special thanks to the people who tested earlier code this was based on, and helped optimize some internal channel shifting stuff so that it runs faster on mobile.  I look forward to further testing, ideas, and suggestions for improvement!<br><br>Download/clone it here:  <a href="https://github.com/nobuyukinyuu/nDrawExts2" target="_blank">https://github.com/nobuyukinyuu/nDrawExts2</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Because of this, anything lower-level which directly deals with normal objects is nearly impossible without modification. However, if you're willing to add a "GetSurface" command (Or similar) to the 'Image' class, then you can basically do anything you want. Alternatively, you could utilize Mojo's existing external surface functionality, and skip the 'Image' class.<br><br>The first method I brought up was used by SKN3 in his <b><a href="http://github.com/skn3/imagebuffer" target="_blank">'skn3.imagebuffer'</a></b> module. That works generally how you want it to. The thing is, it's GLFW only. This means we really just need to overhaul it to work on the other OpenGL targets (Possibly using the 'opengl' module). The problem is, that's not the easiest thing in the world. I personally want to do this at some point, but it's not high enough priority for me yet. If I do end up making a similar module, it's not going to be compatible with SKN3's code, and it would likely be better abstracted.<br><br>Also, if you end up using SKN3's module, beware of the shader code. It works great... If you're willing to rewrite a small portion of it. You see, Mark's made the 'String' conversion functionality a lot nicer since SKN3 wrote that module, so when he tried to patch it, he didn't do a good job. Basically, the strings we get for the source (Most notably) have already been deallocated a majority of the time. So, you end up with gibberish. The answer to this is to use 'String::CString' class directly, then let it be <i>deallocated</i> when the stack pointer gets moved.<br><br><b>TL;DR: No, not really. Not unless you want to deal with image-data (Read from the file). If that's the case, use the 'PixelArray' class in his module.</b> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

(Just <a href="https://github.com/skn3/imagebuffer/blob/8aac2b3c2e7dc56de697a4662b09ff15ab51f189/imagebuffer.monkey#L93" target="_blank">remove the ' ="1" ' on line 93</a>)<br><br>* <b>The next changes are in "imagebuffer.glfw.cpp".</b><br><br>* The '_GetUniformLocation' command's use of 'glGetUniformLocation' should be like this, basically (Memory management will already be done for you):<br><pre class=code>
GLint ShaderProgramNative::_GetUniformLocation(String name)
{
	// --- get location of a uniform ---
	// This location won't change again until the program is re-linked, so it can be reused.
	GLint location = glGetUniformLocation(program, name.ToCString&lt;GLchar&gt;());
	
	// Check for errors:
	error = glGetError();
	if (error == GL_INVALID_VALUE || error == GL_INVALID_OPERATION)
	{
		// An error has occurred.
		return -1;
	}
	
	// Everything worked as expected.
	return location;
}
</pre><br>Just copy and paste that over the existing version.<br><br>* This next one is a bit more work, basically, you'll just remove <a href="https://github.com/skn3/imagebuffer/blob/8aac2b3c2e7dc56de697a4662b09ff15ab51f189/native/imagebuffer.glfw.cpp#L389" target="_blank">the code on this line</a> ('_SetSource'), and replace it with:<br><pre class=code>
String::CString&lt;GLchar&gt; convertedSource = source.ToCString&lt;GLchar&gt;(); // ToUtf8();
const GLchar* theSource = convertedSource;
</pre><br><br>That's about it. If you get any other problems, you'll need to use a static cast with 'ToUtf8', or something. That should be it, though. Just make sure that his use of 'delete' on 'theSource' is no longer there (Delete it, or comment it out).<br><br>Other:<br>* Make sure the uses of 'delete' on lines <a href="https://github.com/skn3/imagebuffer/blob/8aac2b3c2e7dc56de697a4662b09ff15ab51f189/native/imagebuffer.glfw.cpp#L395" target="_blank">395</a> and <a href="https://github.com/skn3/imagebuffer/blob/8aac2b3c2e7dc56de697a4662b09ff15ab51f189/native/imagebuffer.glfw.cpp#L742" target="_blank">742</a> are no longer present. If you just used what I posted, then they shouldn't be.<br><br>* Those <i>should</i> be the only changes you need to make. I specifically made those changes to a new clone myself, and it's working.<br><br>That's about it. The problem right now is that SKN3 didn't really set this module up very well, so it's not the most portable. Not to mention that he kind of hacked this in. If you're interested, though, <a href="http://source.mungo.io/modules/mojo/tree/harmony" target="_blank">Harmony finally supports shaders</a> via Mojo, but it's not really in a stable form yet. SKN3's module should work for the GLFW targets, though.<br><br>There's also the 'GetSurface' method you'll need to add to the 'Image' class (In 'mojo.graphics'), but that's a simple "getter" method (Just have a method called 'GetSurface' return the 'surface' field). I assume you've done that already. Example:<br><textarea class=codebox name="code" wrap=OFF readonly="true" rows="15" cols="80">
Method GetSurface:Surface()
	Return surface
End
</textarea><br><br>You should probably put it <a href="https://github.com/blitz-research/monkey/blob/323030c72bd176ab030cd0989f3a4083ebc2be71/modules/mojo/graphics.monkey#L185" target="_blank">here</a> (As long as it isn't private). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

To my knowledge, there's nothing wrong with using the module via 'OnRender', and I personally think that's the best option. Just keep in mind that attributes like the color will still be kept after you use 'Finish' (Like anything else). As for the display-resize problem, you'll simply have to recreate the FBO and image. Also, you should probably be using Mojo's wrappers for display-management ('SetDeviceWindow'). When destructing the FBO, please make sure to call 'Free' before doing anything else. If you don't, you may have garbage lingering. I recommend <a href="http://www.monkey-x.com/docs/html/Modules_mojo.graphics_Image.html#Discard" target="_blank">manually discarding</a> the 'Image' object it's tied to, as well.<br><br>Considering how problematic SKN3's module is, you should probably just refactor it to your liking.
