There are a some things that seem new and requirements that have to be made before you can actually make a game. But once you get past that you can stick to simple programming or use the advanced features. all I use is Classes and interface with the usual language commands and works great for me. I don't mind the need to compile everything, it's not like it's such a big deal. In OS X you run the ".sh" file and takes care of everything as long as all of the tools are up to date and installed, I never had a problem.<br>I do think that Mark should just stick to one language and just keep updating it but I believe the way he is doing it is the most efficient way for him since it's a one man team. Starting over is easier than modifying existing code. Most of us don't like change because it takes us out of our confort zone and it's the main reason why most here are loosing interest in his products and why Mark is paying the price with such a low interest in them.  But, change is good and I have learned to accept it as part of life so I just flow with it.  I know I could have stayed in MX1 and would have been able to to have the same results. Ultimately what matters is the skills of the programmer. I find that a lot of individuals complain about what it's not there and want but once it's there find something else to complain about: just an excuse for why they can't make the game they want or why they can't apply the triple A features they want to apply. I have made a few games In monkey and what I have found out is that the only thing that limits me is the creativity. Yes, new features do help and make programming somewhat simpler but with or with out them I can still produce what I want. it's the mental ability to creates something that is interesting to the senses that  is hard. <br><br>I also understand that the same reason why I don't use the Fantom Engine is the same reason why some of us don't like to make the transition to something new. it's the pains of learning it that we hate. Otherwise, I probably would have been using it long time ago as it seems like a good Engine. I also think that I am skilled enough as a programmer that I think that it's easier to code my own stuff than having to learn somebody else's style of coding. But, that doesn't mean I am right. <br><br>Finally I think the transition to MX2 is good choice, from what I can tell, and the more we are there the more we can help each other,  Ultimately the community is what make it a good programming language. And, no matter what anyone here thinks or says Mark has abandoned Mx1 like BlitzBasic, Blitz3d and blitzMax so the Transition is the best option, I think. I just hope that Mark don't try to create another BRL product, that would really be nailing the last nail on the coffin and I am afraid  it will be game over for everybody here. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So no, MX2 won't be the last in the line in my opinion. The community gets smaller and smaller for every new product which is somehow normal because the products get more and more mature and there is less and less reason to use stuff like MX2 <b>as language</b> for instance when there is C++ and C#.<br><br>Earlier products were used because of stability and they were easy to understand.

I see him taking his time to finish it this time and make it work smoothly. IMO I find it more fluid to work with. I don't use lambdas and has not limited me from doing what I want to do. I just learned how to use interfaces and I can see the advantages of using them even though I haven't found a need to use them. All I use are classes along with polymorphing and it does everything I need to do. I use polymorphing because I found it very useful and make more robust code. before I learned how to use polymorphing, I used to thing that it was just a dumb addition to programming but now It has just become part of my daily programming and I like it. I know I can make a game just with functions and get the same results but I find it more pleasant to work with OO code.  I don't know exactly how Lambdas work but I will eventually learned how to used them and if I find use for them, they will become part of my tools to use but for now I don't miss them. I am mostly a self thought OO programmer. I was old School Pascal, Qbasic, Fortran, and procedural assembly. I self thought me how to program C. I couldn't get my head around C++ but after getting into BlitzMax I started getting the hang of OO programming. Little by little I have learned to enjoy OO coding. I don't think I could go back without missing all this new methodology. <br><br>IMO without trying to offend anybody here, some how I see the fable of the fox and the sour grapes here.  :).<br>These are only my opinions and everybody has a right to do whatever they want. The community can make MX1 even better better but it will take lot's of love and dedication to it. I will only wish you all good luck with it. Most of us are just hobby programmers and any language will work fair enough for our purpose. I have moved on an I don't miss it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

MX and M2 and all the other languages are just tools. And believe me, I have more tools in my toolbag, not only these. Monkey isn't my tool of choice anymore. My current game is being devleoped with a different tool.I am just here to support the users of my MX frameworks.<br><br>About M2, I yet have to see the advantage of M2 over MX. The building process is time consuming for me. One simple change to your module and you have to rebuild it. This was much more convenient in MX. <br>M2 1.06 didn't compile at all for me, dunno why as 1.02 was fine. I don't need lambas. I didn't even use interfaces before in MX. Just classes and extened classes in MX. I have created modules to interface with external SDKs in MX. So again, I have to see the advantage of M2 over MX. But I love the design of Ted2. To bad it lacks a class/method/function listbox to navigate in your code. Mojo2 in M2 is still inferior ot Mojo2 in MX. <br><br>For me it is about getting a job done. As simple as possible. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I really can't tell you why I like M2 over M1. I know I feel more comfortable and more productive with M2 than M1 and is not that I use any different aspects of the tool. I have not gotten in to the position where M1 does what M2 doesn't either. To me it just seems Faster and more Robust but I guess its just a personal sentiment. When I left BMax I wasn't sure I liked the performance of M1 and I had never really been happy with it. I left Bmax because of the available other platforms in Monkey but was never really happy with it. So far M2 is meeting my expectations and it's why I am happy with it.<br><br>It's good you are satisfied with M1 and hope it fills your needs. As for me I have moved on to M2 and don't regret it. The only thing that bothers me is  that some programmers ditch about things that they don't understand and make conclusions without real knowledge and is why my comment about the sour grapes. But hey, everybody is entitle to an opinion whether it's based on real experiences or not. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Quite a few changes again in M2. And now I hit a showstopper. A class which gets extended won't compile because M2 complains about a missing constuctor. I then have added the constructor and it still complains. In v1.02, M2 was completely fine with it. :-(<br><br>@all others: I am reworking the GUI part of fantomEngine/fantomX at the moment. Let's say the listview isn't the best gadget there. So there will be an enhancement coming. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I run in to a few problems using generics myself. It would give me an error on the generic class but the problem was in the classes that it used . I was able to figure it out by the process of elimination.I needed to add a plain "New()" constructor to all of the classes that used that specific generic class. It might be related to your problem.<br><br>If you still need help figuring that problem out, I can try to help you solve it.    Also, Mark has been very consistent in resolving bugs after they are reported to Github. If there is an issue that can be resolved easily, he'll update it and post it to the repository sometimes immediately. He has been very active with the forums. I am sure he can help you solve it better than anybody there. I am surprised how active he has been in the forums lately. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
