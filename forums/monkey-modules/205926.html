I just committed a fix to the repository for what you were mentioning, and you were right, it was broken. From the look of it, I don't think I should make modules while I'm sick.<br><br>When I said your code was messy, I was talking about how sloppy the code looks. There's lowercase names, some indenting problems, spacing issues, and there's a lack of parentheses in some places. This looks closer to Blitz Basic's fast to write but slow to compile style, which I'm not against, but it doesn't encourage strict programming at all. It just doesn't look like there's a particular style or design philosophy to it, and to me that just screams "rough draft".<br><br>I take pride in writing my code as optimally as possible without losing style or reasonability. I always follow the proper design of a language as closely as possible, and when a language or API strays from its routes, I don't adapt with it without good reason. A good example of this would be Microsoft's naming schemes with their APIs. And then you have C#'s style of doing things, which is even worse about this, but at least it's actually separate from C and C++, so it's less insulting, but I'm getting off-topic.<br><br>Besides it fitting my needs in other respects, the biggest reason I stick with Monkey is because it looks clean and refined. Monkey has the history of Blitz Basic and Blitz Max on its side (Not to mention some Java and C# aspects, which isn't entirely bad), and I think it takes some of their best qualities into consideration. My biggest problems with it are a lack of lower-level access in the language itself, and some things aren't as optimal as they could be. This mainly has to do with a lack of other types of integers, and a few things I can live without in a non-native environment.<br><br>Anyway, now that I'm done ranting; your dequeue class does look like it functions properly, so it should work well for most users. I'm definitely all for you adding it to Monkey. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In terms of getting the size, you should be using 'Size' (Or 'Length' for those who want it). Other than that, I've only used 'Length' once or twice as a local, and that has now been changed from the look of it. But really, if the comments point to it, and the local declaration is right there, confusion shouldn't be an issue.<br><br>However, I do agree with what you were saying about what is basically a memory leak, and I even made a small comment about this. I was thinking of eventually just checking unused space until it reached a multiple of 'InitSize', then shifting over (I'd probably do this in 'Put'). That doesn't exactly sound efficient, but it would be an effective approach. I may just end up having 'In' wrap back around properly, but it sounds like it could cause problems.<br><br>The reason for so many really basic wrappers for commands is choice, and keeping things consistent with other modules ('Push', 'Pop', 'Add', 'Remove', etc). Allowing users to use these same commands their used to is not only more convenient, but you could technically switch out what class is doing what, making it act almost as a wrapper itself.<br><br>Basically, if you make sure all unaltered wrapper methods call the same method, the implementation is not only easy to find, but consistent between the commands. In example; if you have 'Length' return 'Count', but 'Count' changes, you might get problems. However, if 'Length' returned 'Size', I never have to change or worry about it. This model of doing things has served me well in the past, I just need to get around to documenting it (For this module at the very least).<br><br>Honestly, I do agree that this is a bit cluttered, but at least it has a strict design philosophy behind it. However, the 'GetData' and 'SetData' methods were honestly only there to try and make things more future-proof and controllable, but I don't think it's really worth having them there at this point.<br><br>I've moved everything 'Data' related to two properties now. Assignment of '_Data' should be done using the 'Data' property if it's from an outside/unrelated source, otherwise use '_Data' itself. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
