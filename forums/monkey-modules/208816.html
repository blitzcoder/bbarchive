My analysis here isn't meant to put down the Diddy's version, just pointing out the differences I noticed. Just a quick look, it looks like Diddy's version requires pretty much the entire Diddy library. It appears that Diddy's retrieves data from the XML file as requested, whereas mine loads it all into memory. My library is fully documented, but Diddy's is more polished. Diddy's does things far above and beyond what's needed though, including collision detection and rendering, whereas my library only loads images using LoadImage, which can be overridden of course. Overall DIddy's looks more polished and eventually my library will get to that point, hopefully :D <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

With a few interface and functionality tweaks, it would be nearly perfect.<br><br>I've gotten it into my head several times to make a TuDee loader and engine for Blitzmax, and later Monkey, but I always get overwhelmed. TuDee just does so damn many things! If I started, I would feel compelled to implement every single feature, and it would end up being a year-long project. TuDee's author did make a Monkey loader after I told him about the language, but it's out of date, and only supports a tiny subset of TuDee's features.<br><br>I'm struggling through trying go get Tiled maps working properly with IgnitionX right now, and I keep fantasizing about being able to use TuDee in my Monkey projects. It's a shame TuDee didn't catch on, even after the author released it as freeware.<br><br>I recommend everyone who is interested in an amazing 2d map editor check out TuDee.<br><br>Edit: Huh, I guess I went a bit off-topic, there. It's great that you're working on another Tiled loader. It's always good to have alternatives.

All of the features of Tudee can be implemented in a tiled map so my first inclination is to make a tiled exporter for tudee rather than a monkey module, since all the major monkey frameworks seem to have tiled support and also my tiled importer if you don't want to use a framework. <br><br>I have a few projects lined up right now but I can look into something for you in a few weeks.

Unfortunately, I am on the "unemployed and looking for a job" side of the spectrum, rather than the "can afford to pay people for things" side of the spectrum.

Last year, when I had a job that handed me a five-figure bonus, I didn't have time for personal programming projects. Now, I have time, but I'm eating ramen noodles and looking for couches to sleep on. Life is funny like that.

It's very close to supporting every tiled feature and I plan to commit next week to making that more of a reality.<br><br>Right now it can store all tiled data properly (I think maybe) except for external tsx files, which I should have completed next week.

It'll probably crash in some maps too because the rendering is only just begun. And I'm fairly sure I don't have padding/margins correct yet on image loading as that's completely untested and not well spelled out in the spec.<br><br>Right now the renderer I provided can display hexagonal and orthogonal maps but I haven't tested out the others. It supports unlimited layers and draw them in the right order. Documentation is not yet completed.<br><br>If anyone would like to contribute, I'd be happy to add any commits. The parts I probably won't get to anytime soon are compression, zlib and gzip. I probably won't get to integrated image assets (png or whatever inside a data field in the map) but all of that would be great to have.<br><br>Also I changed the license to a more standard and open license.<br><br>Check out the hexagonal-mini.tmx and sewers.tmx files to see it in action.
