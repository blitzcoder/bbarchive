This is MiniC N.Edition. I decided that instead of more-or-less spamming on the original MiniC topic, I'd make my own. Since I've turned the language into something different than was probably envisioned by the original creator.<br><br>MiniC N.Edition is my overhauled (internally), fixed, and more robust version MiniC (if Mini makes sense anymore).<br><br><b>Note:</b> Most original MiniC code will run in this version. Although because of several bugs in the original MiniC and the changes I've made so that MiniC variable altering is done like every other programming language, that is, it doesn't use references by default anymore, your original code may not work as intended. Although maybe now it will work as intended *wink wink*.<br><br>Fixes (from the original MiniC only)<div class="quote"> <br> * Fixed variable resolution issues<br> * Fixed negative numbers<br> * Fixed order of operations ( look down a bit on docs -&gt; <a href="http://www.nrgs.org/dev/miniccbdocs/lang.html" target="_blank">http://www.nrgs.org/dev/miniccbdocs/lang.html</a> )<br> * Fixed early returns ( no longer continues to run code if function returns )<br> * Fixed empty functions crash<br> * Fixed statement list issues<br> * Fixed parameter name collision issues <br></div>Changes<div class="quote"> <br> * Added bitwise operators AND, OR, XOR, and NOT ( &amp;, |, ^, ~ )<br> * Added string multiplication which repeats text (similar to python)<br> * Added object operator overloading ( documentation on how to do this will come later, although 1 example does exist )<br> * Added scope operator overloading ( there's an example on page 2 )<br> * Added better number reading (scientific notation) ( e.g.  val = 3.45e-2 )<br> * Added boolean AND, OR, and NOT ( &amp;&amp;, ||, ! )<br> * Added modulo and integer modulo ( %, ~% )<br> * Added integer division ( ~/ )<br> * Added ternary if block ( ?: )<br> * Added bitshifting ( &gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;, &gt;&gt;&gt; )<br> * Added pre/post increment/decrement ( ++, -- )<br> * Added reference variables ( e.g.  i = &amp;b )<br> * Added identical operators ( ===, !== )<br> * Added arrays and arrays of arrays [of arrays [of arrays [...]]] ( [] )<br> * Added special variable "arguments" inside every function call that contains all arguments against that function<br> * Added all augmented assignment operators<br> * Added for loop (experimental as of 1/29/2014)<br> * Added foreach loop (experimental as of 1/29/2014)<br> * Added delete keyword ( delete var [, ...] )<br> * Added break/continue keywords ( for loops )<br> * Added typeof function for returning types ( e.g.  typeof(3.5) == 'number' )<br> * Added 'as' keyword for type cast primary types (e.g.  3.5 as 'string' )<br> * Added 'has' keyword for checking if a scope contains a property (e.g.  {var val=0} has 'val' )<br> * Added 'in' keyword for 'foreach' loops (e.g.  foreach( item in {var a=0,b=2,c=4} ) print(item); )<br> * Added object notation for scopes ( . ) ( This is final (unless some other problems popup) )<br> * Added lazy in scope variable assignment ( e.g.  someScope.newVar = 3 )<br> * Added var keyword to define in-scope variable ( does not overwrite parent scope )<br> * Added object closures ( same as func returning this after running that func )<br> * Added internal object interfacing between Monkey and MiniC<br> * Added call stack tracer when compiled in debug mode ( sort-of experimental as of 1/29/2014 )<br> * Added null type ( e.g. my_var = null )<br> * Added yield (partially working 10/7/2015, does not yield from foreach calls yet)<br> * Added contextless evaluation of statements into the VMConsole<br> * Removed need for braces in if/else blocks<br> * Removed need for braces in while blocks<br> * Assignments can now be done anywhere! (e.g. while( c = get_char() ) print(c); )<br> * The dollar sign is a valid identifier character like in JS ( $ )<br> * Increased Scanner, Parser, and VM speed (esp. noticeable for mobile) <br></div>Current Notes (1/30/2014)<div class="quote">  * Working on changing how 'this' operator works<br> * Binary and hex reading is coming <br></div><br>You can get it here: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/Goodlookinguy/minic-n.edition" target="_blank">https://bitbucket.org/Goodlookinguy/minic-n.edition</a><br><br>I'm extremely open to useful changes if anyone wants to add any. I'm still currently fixing, updating, and upgrading the code. By the end of these changes, there will be a number of extra changes, like hexadecimal, binary, and scientific notation for numbers. As well as explicit datatype conversion in the form of "(expr) as (type)".<br><br><b>FAQs</b><br><i>I need functions...</i><br>My <a href="https://bitbucket.org/Goodlookinguy/minic-commonbindings" target="_blank">MiniC Common Bindings library</a> will turn MiniC N.Edition into an extremely robust tool. It even has eval and include functions now. The documentation is slowly being made as it stands, but here's what's available - <a href="http://www.nrgs.org/dev/miniccbdocs/" target="_blank">http://www.nrgs.org/dev/miniccbdocs/</a><br><br><i>How to do integer modulo and division?</i><br>~/ for division. ~% for modulo. These operators are based on Google's Dart language.<br><br><i>Something is not executing as expected...</i><br>Post it. I'll see if it's MiniC or you.<br><br><i>What kind of language is MiniC N. Edition?</i><br>MiniC N. Edition is a multi-paradigm programming language (imperative, functional, etc.). It takes many good things from many languages and slaps it into one. It's sort of a jack-of-all trades language that allows you to program the way you want to.<br><br><i>Any future plans? (Dec 2015)</i><br>Yes, although probably not until 2016. Number one thing is to change how extended classes work to allow for overriding of primary types and such. Next, I want to add in immutable variables. (static ee = func() { return 3 };). After that I want to continue work on my AST-to-ASM conversion so that you can pre-compile scripts for games that will run and compile faster than the AST-VM. It also means I have to finish my Bytecode-VM.<br><br><i>What does the 'N' really stand for in 'N.Edition'</i><br>Nicholas. It's my name.<br><br><i>Is there a realistic example of how this could be used?</i><br>Oh, most definitely. Take a look at my <a href="https://bitbucket.org/Goodlookinguy/minic-commonbindings/src/fb758f9796c68c706ca2bf06f596b126056d8799/examples/console.monkey?at=default" target="_blank">console example</a> in my MiniC Common Bindings library.<br><br><i>Why do you bump the thread so much?</i><br>Because I have ADD. If I don't constantly bump this thread and get reactions my motivation will die off faster than you can blink an eye. I'm not kidding. This is not a joke or meant to get a laugh. My ADD is a really serious problem in my life and one of the ways I've overcome it is to constantly engage in whatever I'm doing.<br><br><i>Example Code</i><br>This piece of code here shows a very JavaScript-esque language design. This is of course an optional style as the language is multi-paradigm.<br><pre class=code>var e = (func(){return 6;})();
print(e);

if (e == 6 &amp;&amp; (func()

				return true;

print(collection.length); // prints "5"</pre><br>It will support the actions "insert(index, value)", "remove(index)", "push(value)", "pop()", and "collection has 'xyz'" as well as the property "length".<br><br>The new language standards will also be using camelCasing (not PascalCasing or underscores).

This fixes the function return value problem as well as other mysterious issues. I may in fact rewrite some of the code at some point to rely on context instead of the hacky code I have in there right now. It may be the end-all solution to scope related issues.<br><b>Edit: </b> It turns out the parser has a few bugs.

Now that I'm back to this one again, I wanted to wait a bit to see what needed to be done about certain issues in my head. I've come to the conclusion that I'm going to have to do a large-scale refactor again. This is horrible as I just got done with the last one 2 weeks ago. The problem is that there are several structurally weak areas as well as a recent change that made the compiled assembly size bloat. This to me is a call for further refactoring which will hopefully not devolve in refuctoring. Thankfully a significant change I made was the idea of "contexts" for stack values. This is helping solve a great number of issues which will make the refactoring go a lot smoother.<br><b>~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UPDATE 7/14/16 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~</b><br>Mmmmmmmm.....still refactoring. This will probably take until the end of the month if I'm being honest. I also did a code line count and ignoring empty lines and comments, it's 6,564 lines of code. That's a lot of code and would explain why it's taking exponentially longer to fix issues and refactor. Luckily I've gotten a handle on the code structure and am working out the wrinkles in the structure weaknesses.<br>Aside from the boo-hoo, whoa is me, and I need hugs and energy drinks, I've now also started implementing a "prototype" system that works very similarly to JS. In fact, my ultimate goal is to make some javascript code portable with little to no changes. Of course, certain things will have to be changed. "val | 0" will not convert 'val' into a magical int when doing division or modulus operations, so that part can't be helped as it is my language, not JS. However, that doesn't mean one day that it won't work as the system is setup to handle int values in the future. Whatever the case, there's a lot more work to do, but things are starting to become really amazing. It's just too bad I had made the language so complex as to cause me to have to do this much work just for an initial release of the bytecode compiler. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
