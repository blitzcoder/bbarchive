Most people wont notice or care(even knowing) :)<br><br>One thing yet I can criticize technically is those feet in the columns..too much volume trusted to the texture. It's to much volume to fake...wether do that with geometry (take the foot and bump a bit if ur modeller let's u work with the texture on it so u can bump exactly in place) or if can't wait such load of new polies, use/change the bigger volumes, or find a photo of another type of feet...<br><br>Maybe u plan to use flat normal maps, then I shut up ;)<br><br>I love th floor mosaics...<br><br><br>I know u gotta keep low poly, but in exteriors, maybe detail the top endings of brick walls, speciall the bircks near one. The rest of wall seems ok so. That and that quad-cone...I'd do some more complex geometry and texture for that...u can keep simple in the walls, but is cool if u detail a bit more on corners with their towers, imho.<br><br><br>The exterior floor looks nice :)<br><br><br>In general, very good treatment in textures, imho.<br><br><br>Also like the geometry u made for interior ceiling.<br><br>Try the union of floor and tiny mountain, make continues: it looks to much as u put a different object...think of UT2k3 terrains.<br><br><br>I like the space distribution, how u designed the interior, in space, and elements. Quite good rooms for a level in that matter.<br><br>hmm...about what i said bout bumps faked in texture...forget about extra geometry..I'd have to see it in realtime to know if it'd look too much as flat volume...<br><br>The ceiling in gothic church used to have nerves, those where actually the supporting structure. Where the nerves system what provided of really complex and tall structures (gothic, against the previous mtimes, is all about height, and light, but exterior lighting would kill ur dark ambience fo rthe game, and there where gothic styles more dark, so...)<br><br><br>Just a question...do u actually have imposed ur self a very low poly limit, so the game be played in low machines? if so, many of the geometry stuff to be detailed is not wanted...<br><br>Don't take me wrong; if I say so much is because things can be better said of an already very good level...from a bad level..u don't know where to start... ;)<br><br>And I do really love medieval times, gothic, and romanic styles (if so they're called in english)<br><br>gothic Gargoyles are one of my favs in that era. The sculptures really let their imagination run wild in there, as they where meaning evil creatures, and kept seen politically correct, as was to show people how bad evil stuff is...and they got influenced by oriental art and other...perhaps one of the most creative side in those times...(you should add gargoyles (if that's the word) hehe)<br><br>Sorry, too lengthy comment.
