What's funny is that a game set is available for Vassal...<br><br>I learn about that because I'm thinking about creating a board games that would take a few rules from existing board games and I was wondering if it was an issue. Mainly with Cthulhu stuff since part of the myth as fallen into the public domain (that's why you see a lot of game based on Cthulhu these days).<br><br>Anyway, I didn't decided yet if it would be a 3D games (then I would use Unity3D) or a 2D games (then I would use my BlitzMax Engine) because 3D is nice but pretty disturbing for board games when it's not correctly done.
