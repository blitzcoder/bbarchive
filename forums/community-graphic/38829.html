BTW, sometimes I rendered to texture this stuff...and environment maps was something that luckily our engine -actually my friend cowrokers were making the stuff as we asked for it, was a joy in that aspect- supported, though it never looked exactly like in the engine later on.<br><br>This stuff is all rushed, anyway...usually based on reference found in google..they called me "Yahoo" in first job, and near to call me "Google" in that second -there was a 2d based games in the middle of these two jobs- for I use to find good ref images/blueprints easily, hehe. <br><br>For real life objects is a need, though I never get too accurate, not needed, and no time usually, anyway :)<br>So i could work with Wings in a very similar way than with characters that I also made, but for characters, as I was also the only one concept guy, with a single main player(the boss wanted me to do so), all the rest I could avoid having to use the ref image method.<br><br>IE, for the extinguisher, I used just a front ref image plane. Built the tube/pipe(extrude-free, lift, etc) and all the stuff. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The uv mapping, with Ultimate Unwrap.<br><br>For textures, all which fit me at the moment...dp3d, Ps, gimp...like in anothe rcompany, even used Pixia.<br><br>I have no kind of embarrasment to use totally free textures found in vaults, if they were very hi res (1600 and the like) -As my methods use to be mixing a load of textures in layers in multiply mode, bumps, etc...<br><br>In last stage, for a game project I don't preserve sadly any shot, we could use a digital camera in the studio, so, several texturing works relied strongly in wel retouched photos we made near the studio. Kindda funny :)<br><br>The brushed tetxure in the gate...curiously, you are the second person to mentionm the gate...while it was a too rushed work I made really quick..:)<br><br>I was not fond of putting it double, the gate, but was imposed.Kindda bad for performance, also. U see, for then, the levels intotal got a bit hi poly for then... I remember one room-level...heck, was like 100k tris...! But the cheap atis could handle it -not for an unreal game, but wasn't the aim- in the engine...I think we did count with really good coders...such a pitty. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
