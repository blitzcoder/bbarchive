Thanks for the comments. <br><br>Malice: <br>I'm open to criticisms and suggestions at any time :)<br><br>During 'exploration mode' of the game, it is a first person view environment, and the characters aren't seen, they are only seen during the 'combat mode' of the game, which is a turn based, zoomed-out isometric view, so the 'playing pieces' of the characters aren't really big, and probably never viewed closer than the view in the screenshot.<br><br>I'll have to think about the font. I'm trying to work out what size works best visually and still being readable, on different size monitors and resolutions. To me, it seems a normal size font on my 19" screen. When I do beta testing, and people run the program full-screen, I'll see what people say. Perhaps a GUI-SCALING slider in the options screen, so people can enlarge or shrink the text size according to their preferences? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

When you enter a room, and it displays text saying what is there in the original game, I want to actually have scenery in the room, to visually represent it, like you would have in a more modern first-person game. For example, in the first level of the original, going into the officer's lounge shows an empty 2x2 room that looks like any other, and has text about a bombed out room with broken ceiling and shattered tables, so I want to model a broken ceiling and shattered tables to actually see it in the first-person view instead of just another empty room.

Project start date was 30/Oct/2009, but level design didn't start until 8th of November.<br><br>Kryzon: I'm not sure what to say about the engine? It's programmed in Blitz 3D. Here's some of the things in it:<br><br>Camera: In exploration mode it's a free-look camera, walking around like in a first-person shoot. In combat mode, the camera rises up and looks down at the ground at an isometric angle, and you move characters around a square at a time in a turn based fashion, fighting the enemies you encounter. When the enemies are defeated, the camera zooms back down to where it was originally, at head height, and resumes first-person view again.<br><br>Minimap - I've just added a minimap feature too. It takes a pre-drawn map for a level, and shows a 30 meter radius around the player, in the top left corner of the screen. As the player turns, an arrow on the map rotates to face the direction the player is facing, and the map scrolls as the player walks.<br><br>Rooms: A lot of the game is based around the idea of walking around the map, going into rooms to see what is in them. To save on the amount of models and polygons loaded up, I'm thinking of making it so that when you click on a door to open it, it then loads the objects that are inside the room behind the door. When you step inside, the door closes behind you. After you are finished with the room, when you open the door and leave, the door closes behind you, and the objects in the room 'unload' again. This way, much of the content of the level only exists in the game engine when you are actually at its location. This means I can have more shapes and models for things like distant scenery and outside scenes without affecting performance or level loading times. If I load all the objects all at once, there can be a long loading time as the level generates all the objects. Doing it this way, there's just a micro-pause as the doors are opening and the objects in the room behind the door appear.<br><br>Party: You have a party of up to 6 characters that you control. In combat mode, each of them has a model to move around when their turn comes. There are 6 races and 5 careers. I think there's 55 skills in the game's rpg rules system, but not all of the skills are used in the first game.<br><br>I'm not sure what else to say :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You've not implemented cell-shading (which has to do with the way a model is shaded), you've implemented model outlines.<br><br>By the way, are you getting acceptable results with your outlining method? When I've experimented with it in the path, I've been very unhappy with it. It looks okay for still shots of simple shapes, but I always disliked the way that the lines would scale with distance and perspective and the slightly "dirty" look and inconsistent look that they often had on complex models.<br><br>There are ways to implement (and to approximate) cell-shading in Blitz3d, but I wouldn't use them if I were you. Your current method of full-bright models plus outlines has the potential for creating a nice illustrated effect.

I'm creating the black, inside-out model clones, for the outline, within my modelling program, so that I can preview what it will look like, rather than generating them within blitz. That way I can move vertices around, and refine the shape if I want. Sometimes if two shapes overlap, there can be odd visual artefacts where the overlap occurs, depending on the angle you are looking at the model from, so I try to alter the black outline mesh to have as clean a line as possible.<br><br>I do find that distance can be a problem. Very distant scenery, such as a city on the horizon, I have to push the faces of the outline mesh out a big amount to make them visible at all, while things that the player will look at up close I have to only push out the faces a short amount, otherwise the outlining looks too thick.<br><br>If I could find a way to produce an even-thickness outline, regardless of the visual distance, that would be great. For now though, I'm happy with how it's looking when walking around in the game. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In the XXVC universe, there's no such thing as 'aliens' - just genetically engineered peoples and creatures, and humanity is only in our own solar system - there's no interstellar travel.

I love the effect of cell-shading/outlining and how you accomplished it!<br><br>To be honest., the thinner outlines at distance seems perfectly okay from looking at the screenshot. As does the fogging on distant objects. I honestly think without those features, you would lose more 3-D appearance and it would NOT look as good. As it stands, you have an excellent artistic style that looks as if it has been drawn rather than rendered whilst still maintaining a 3D depth, if you were to obtain consisttent thick outlines or less fogging etc. you would lose that depth and the image would be 'flattened', making depth-perception much more difficult/confusing for the viewer! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Some more development pics.<br><br>(BeAnAge - I thought the gallery was for finished projects? I'm a long way from finishing this one.)<br><br>I've started doing characters and equipment in more detail. The first pic, showing the 'playing piece' for the rocket jock, had shading, lighting, etc, and I've found that doing a full-bright with outline environment, shaded characters clash with it. So here's a pic of a Terran using full bright and outlining. I drew the face on the model like a 'black pen' to keep with the 'drawn' look of it. Still a few minor glitches in the outlining mesh I need to fix on the model - particularly where the fingers join to the palm of the hand, making his knuckles look black.<br><br>With Malice's initial post in this thread, I decided I want some characters to be visible in first-person view as well as in zoomed out combat view, so I'm hoping to get character models look alright at any distance.<br><br>Anyway, here's an unarmoured Terran, holding a bolt gun, and another pic showing what it might look like in combat at an isometric angle.<br><br><img src="http://i280.photobucket.com/albums/kk185/tsmpaul/Countdown%20to%20Doomsday%203d/UnarmouredTerranWithBoltGun.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://i280.photobucket.com/albums/kk185/tsmpaul/Countdown%20to%20Doomsday%203d/UnarmouredTerranWithBoltGunisometri.jpg"> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
