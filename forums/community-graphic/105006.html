I love the cherry blossom scene as well. I'm a sucker for cherry blossom in VNs.<br><br>Adam: Very good spot on the shadow bias. I had initially assumed that it was because there was a gap between the bottom of the wall and the floor. But if you look on the right hand side of the corridor, that does not appear to be the case. So I think you're right that it may be the shadow bias is off.<br><br>Matty: I guess it is unusual for the lockers to be built into the walls. Before we started the concepts, we went through a whole bunch of photos, looking for elements we liked and could mix and match. The lockers were embedded like that in this one particular photo, but you're probably right that it's unusual, even in Japan. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I have one piece of critique however :)<br><br>You need to rough things up a little, it is too stiff at present, there is too little "life" in the art. Turn a table a degree,  generally slightly move things around, doesn't have to be much. Let the pushed in chairs be a bit offset, and not all of them so straight (or lined up) Put a dropped paper in the hallway.. etc.. things like that. To show that people actually use the place. You did do it with the black board though. And put some scribble on the wall, and tables etc.. And the swimming pool need to have the edges pushed down to meet the water. The reason is that pools are (most often) designed this way to prevent tripping over the edge (EDIT: hmm, found the orginals, and this is the first time I have ever seen a raised edge for a pool in a school. Typical :) ) There is (often) also a place for the water to fall into, along the edges of the pool, to prevent flooding. And bevel those edges too, to make them more natural :) And swimming areas in general don't have sharp edges.<br><br>Hmm, a lot of points there... sorry... work habit as an old artist. But still, you get the idea :) Great work though.<br><br>Update: I took some time to look at reference images.. and guess what I found? :) :<br><br><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Hamamatsu_Technical_High_School-Swimming_pool_%26_1st_gymnasium%2C_Hamamatsu_Shizuoka_Japan_2014.06.29.JPG/1024px-Hamamatsu_Technical_High_School-Swimming_pool_%26_1st_gymnasium%2C_Hamamatsu_Shizuoka_Japan_2014.06.29.JPG"><br><br>So I guess some *do* have edges at the swimming pools at schools (didn't think I would ever see that, but there you go :) ) But still, it is from this very image your image is made. That is fine by itself (but it can be an issue with the original photographer, you need to be aware of this) but you can see the rough parts, and bevelled edges I talked about in this image. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
