These spaceships do not exist, so how can the models be ordinary??? If you mean perhaps unoriginal, I know Static has painstakingly created each one from scratch. If you suggest the shapes are perhaps similar to many tried and tested methods, well - I would agree that these are quite likely shapes for spaceships. Static received instructions regarding the general premise for each factions' spacecraft 'architecture' and has faithfully reproduced what I had hoped for.]]]<br>Perhaps, from a 'expert modeller's' point of view. To me, they're so much better than I can do, and will certainly 'do the job'. The skins are a basic premise, and will be re-done properly near the end of the project. Thanks for the comments, however.<br><br>As for your other points, if you popped over to the 'Galactic Allegiance Media discussion' forum, you will see that each ship has a detailed histroy and breakdown highlighting the features of the craft. [[[EDIT - Static knows which ships are capable of atmoshperic flight etc., and it's my job to assign the various sections of the hull to be engines, fuel tanks etc for the in-game collisions other than that, Static has complete artistic license to shape his creations. I trust him and he's never let me down yet!]]]I dunno if you actually read the lines above each picture, but, with the exception of the 'alien vessel', they are fighter craft. These images are of the ship meshes.  Without cargo modules, gun emplacements and missile pylons etc.<br><br>Check out the forums where the ship creation and modular expansion for each craft is discussed.<br><br>Finally, the main, non-alien craft shown above share a similar style as they were (in-the-game) endorsed by the same military regime. The rival 'Factions' will have similar, and equivalent classifications of craft, but an altogether different appearance and style.(Almost like different makes of cars.)<br><br>Anyway, I merely wanted to display the models as they were... Models of spaceships. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
