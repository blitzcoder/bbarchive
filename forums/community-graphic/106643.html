Maybe it is more something with perspective ? (the left side - in POV - is "bigger" than the right side - should be the opposite).<br><br><br>To add something to anatomy/structure:<br>- lance is a bit hm odd (handle is not centered to rest of the lance)<br>- the human seems to have no hip (chest-armor ends and the horses back starts...)<br>- chest looks a bit too "bulgy" (just look how his "thin" neck comes out of the armors opening) -&gt; the shoulders are incorrect because of this and his arms are "off". If parts of the arms are hidden under the shoulder plate (possible) the knight would be not really enjoying to lift his arms more than 10cm ;-D (so it is the fault of the armory blacksmith)<br>- harness of the horse is a bit too "wide" for a warriors/knights horse - maybe add some details there to make it look "massive" (like hardened leather) - for now it looks like simple "cloth material"<br><br><br>What I really like is the background: simplistic but exposing enough to make the viewers fantasy accept it as a "wide and open country" . There your strokes are places well for a "sketch". To improve you might do what "Bob Ross" always did: add one or more trees in the front to save on drawing these little things in the background. It also offers a new hint in the perspective: it makes it more apparent that there is a "hill" or "higher ground" on which the knight is standing with his horse.<br><br><br><br>@ Pencils<br>Which kind of pencil are you using? Looking at the knights nose you have a very "sharp" one... but the outlines seem to be done with some kind of coal pencil.<br>Need to learn that "gradient building"/shading once I find the time ... I like that but always tended to just "smear" the portions shaded with a soft pencil. <br><br><br><br>Generally:<br>If you want to use your paintings in a game: do you want to digitize them in an old-fashioned way? (scanning them in, redoing the outlines, painting the inners)<br><br><br>Or do you think you now practice "drawing itself" and then move on to draw with a tablet and a digitizer? or ... ?<br><br><br>A decade ago I used the "scanner"-approach to create avatars for my website (which explains their "blue/orange" outfits)<br><img src="http://www.gamezworld.de/grafiken/jane_evo.jpg"><br><a href="http://www.gamezworld.de/grafiken/jane_gross3.jpg" target="_blank">Result in big</a><br><br><img src="http://www.gamezworld.de/grafiken/dude_evo.jpg"><br><a href="http://www.gamezworld.de/grafiken/dude_gross3.gif" target="_blank">Result in big</a><br><br>And yes... the anatomy is not the best there too.<br><br><br>I personally think that drawing "complete scenes" is a really tedious and time consuming job ... as all these little details need your attention. Doing them in the computer allows to have some "copy paste" portions (copying a tree to multiple scenes... having a trunk in one scene, the left  portion peeking into the pictiure on the next ...and so on).<br><br><br><br>@ AT-43<br>looks good regarding proportions: maybe this is your way to go first: trying to "rip" others arts so you get a feeling of how things work when portions are invisible.<br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I do not know what wacom you have but: maybe draw the outlines / shape on a smaller zoom than your details (so you can still draw "1:1" to your screen). Then zoom in to draw all the little things. No worry, only the big portions of an element need to get drawn then. So a button does need the outline but might even be recognizeable without the 2/4 holes for the twist).<br><br><br>At the end you might scale it down - but when scaling, play with the scaling algorithm - just to avoid what your big screen exposes: too much anti-aliasing. Up to 25% of your images "non-transparent pixels" are antialiased ones.<br>Lowres sprites _love_ crispyness (as the players brain does the most work ;-)).<br><br><br>By the way: I do not like these drawing tablets ...never achieved a good coordination. Bought an HP Elitebook just to have a good digitizer to paint directly on the screen - is way cheaper (but also worse in quality) than the expensive wacom boards (or a MS surface).<br><br><br>Aside of that: it is a good idea to have everything "drawn" by you - this might not lead to the best overall graphic wonders, but lead surely to something with a unique style - your drawing style.<br>A good idea might be to use this "its a personal drawing style" approach also in your game. So eg. draw things in black / white, in color ... and tell the story of a hero whose dreams turn alive - and he is continuing to write a story (with your hand written glyphs/letters then !) to defeat the worst of the worst, the diabolo of all devils, the weaver of all fates.<br><br><br>PS: good skin color choice for the "android" (last pic) - also the glasses are having a good cartoon glasses-color.<br><br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You might improve your shading (I like the upper part of the nose of "quad titty lizard-witch") but the missing symmetry of the base shapes (head and "beard/hair" of beardy-man, body of the "knight") makes it look way more amateurish/childish than your current skill would be.<br><br>Also: please stand up now! let your hands hang as if you were powerless. Now look how long your arms are. Normally your hand wrist should be a bit below the hip bones.<br>Next: Now put your hand in front of your face. place the thenar (bottom part of your hand) on your chin and your finger tips on your forehead (at least the middle finger should be able to reach it).<br><br>Your arms in the drawing get smaller and smaller until they reach the "micro hands".<br><br><br>I assume you have drawn the sword "after" you draw the arm and hand - so the sword does not look "dangerous" and "mighty" ... it has the wideness of a rapier ... it looks more like "needle" worn by Arya Stark (GoT).<br><br><br>Left food of the beardy-man (pov: right one) looks as if it got no heel. It just looks as if that one would be called "disabled" nower days.<br><br><br><br>Generic:<br>- bricks are looking good<br>- door (wood) looks good too<br>- torch has wrong perspective (or it is "right oriented" [pov: left])<br><br><br>Generic tips:<br>- there exist human body references (eg. puppets) google images for "human body drawing reference" and you will find enough<br>- draw lighting/shadows according to lights in your scenario, not "randomly". <br>- things like capes benefit from shading (as you make the cloth look less "flat"). Also the body will take away light from the cape so it would need to have darker areas.<br><br>Re: lighting<br>It seems beardy-man is affected by torchs light - at least I imagine it is intended. The knight has portions which fit to the light, but his right arm (pov: left) is shaded as if there is light coming from the right (pov: left) and shaded therfore on the opposite site. Or the arm is bend behind the back - so the body shadows it - but this would look odd as the shoulders are rotated in the opposite direction.<br><br><br><br>While it isn't the best idea to do so (because of "practice" and outputting "dreams") I  would suggest to redo that "dungeon entry" scene - but pay attention to proportions and symmetry this time.<br><br>I assume - when properly sketched out before - these both dudes will look way more "don't talk to us or it will hurt" than now.<br><br><br>BTW: if they are like "robbers/bandits" they would have "worn off weapons" (notches?!). Both: axe and sword should look way bigger to be "serious" weapons (I know, in reality weapons were not so big every time - because a morning star is dangerous enough with 2-3kg weight ;-)).<br>Do not forget to give the knight a bigger shield. The size of this shield is the one of a "buckler" - which does not fit to the armory the knight wears. If sized that way, it was mostly "circular"/round. At least I cannot remember to have seen such things in the museums.<br><br><br>Hope you don't mind the "bad review".<br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Not sure whether its your stylistic choice but your eyes are very flat and cartoony looking.

This really cant be repeated enough times. The fundamentals would be your basic skills and understanding. This in turn is what you use to do a good drawing. Ill elaborate a bit on that.<br><br>1. Do you have good eye-hand coordination? Can you draw a straight line where you want it, a circle, box etc? This is very important, because it doesnt matter how much you understand a subject (like a human face) if you cant put it on paper. <br><br>2. Do you understand perspective and shapes? Can you draw a basic box in 2d or 3d? Other shapes? Can you draw a room full of boxes in 3d, and have it look convincing? I am still talking about just drawing lines here, no coloring in any way.<br><br>3. The shapes are important, because they are used to build up more complex objects. Can you draw (still just lines) a complete house? A house with garden, playground, porch etc? You can use perspective and the basic shapes from (2) to construct pretty much everything. <br><br>4. Light and values. Go back to your basic shapes and start shading them. Can you draw a box with a simple light source and make it look good? A sphere? Do you understand how light works? This enables you to choose proper values (aka how light or dark something is). Can you draw that room with boxes with a light source, and still make it look convincing? Do you understand how the values you draw work together to make it look convincing? <br><br>5. Materials and light. Can you draw a properly shaded sphere? Can you make it a wooden ball and still make it look convincing? Put some varnish on it? Draw a metal ball instead? Glass? Skin? Do you understand how lighting affects color? Do you understand why a sphere far away on earth looks different from one on the moon? There are basic "rules" that decides how the light and color changes in all these examples. You need to learn and understand them. Suddenly you can draw your complex shapes from (3) fully shaded, and they will work together, and everyone will be very impressed by everything you do. Because you got your fundamentals down. ;)<br><br><br>Dont forget to sit down and just draw for fun. But the above is what I personally would suggest as the fundamentals of drawing. I excluded human anatomy and such, because its more related to understanding and constructing those complex objects then anything else. If you can do the above things, you can sit down and figure out how to break down any subject. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

(maybe she is not believing something). If you then also shaded her nose the wrong way- the whole thing changes. The red center-line (splitting nose and mouth) would no longer be a straight line (or it would no longer split nose and mouth into halfs). The line would become a bit "curvy" - and therefore the line for the eyes might get a different angle.<br><br><br>Nonetheless the basic idea Bobysait presented is very helpful. At least you will spot absolute "misalignments" very fast.

How shadows fall, how a nose covers an eye. <br><br><br><br>PS: Is there a reason to fix yourself to "human drawings" ? Proportion training could be done by eg. some mechanical things too. Shadowing could be done by drawing various geometric shapes (I think you did that already) like cones, cubes ... And making cuts into these cubes (like cutting small other cubes here and there) will help "mesmerizing" how that shadow-light-thing works.<br><br><br>PPS: I think you already come a long way and are yet better (and hmm "more brave") than many of us are.<br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Study the form of the head/face using reference photos from all angles - there are plenty online.<br><br>Above all, keep going.
