People often have a link in their sig (not just on this forum) that leads to their webpage where you can see if they are selling 3d stuff.<br><br>I can tell you an animated character with exclusive rights, i would charge anything from $200 for a lowres RTS model to $2000 for a top top quality Quake 4 level of detail, all depending on the detail and complexity of the model and the number and complexity of animations. And that is (i beleive) considered cheap. It varies greatly. Buildings are usually much cheaper, but also depends on what exactly you need.<br><br>I'm currently in the process of building a portfolio tho, and i'm NOT actively searching for "work". If i do however, i usually do it at 80% of the best price-quality ratio you'd find on the net. So it's all really subjective, the bottom line is you should always say how much you're willing to pay for a certain quality of work and give examples of the quality, then see how many offers you get or be told you're insane.<br><br>Noodle Cower also does some really awesome work from time to time. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The pricing depends on the kind of object, whether it consists of mostly primitive, what the texturing time might be, if it's static or animated, etc. The cheapest things would be simple things like books, a baseball, bowling pins, etc. The worst case scenario's are creature, people, with animations ... and the very highest priced tend to not have any concept art associated with them (meaning i would have to draw out the references myself). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I have found the price range of 60-150 for organic (rigged and textured), and 20-120 for arcitectual.<br>2. None, unless you cover that in the contract (usually you sign a contract with the artist over the needed assets).  I like to have a clause that gives me leway for miscommunications to the artist (artist didnt understand), and leway to the artist for design changes on my part (IE "dont like that there, can you change it slightly to here?")<br>3. Indie forums, google searches, here.<br><br>It's good to note, that unless your doing over a few hundred dollars in jobs with the artist that there is a good chance that the artist might loose interest.<br><br>It's not really their fault though.  They have their own lives to deal with, and "hobby money" doesnt always constitue their full dedication to completion. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It is definitely 10 times as hard as architecture, especially the animating!! It's also important for the artist to know exactly the format that the output is in, and preferably to have the engine at hand for testing/refinements.<br><br>Good post Evak. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
