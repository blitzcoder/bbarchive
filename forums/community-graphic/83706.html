That is take for example top and side views. Both drawings may be of the same lenght, but key points along that lenght, like the start/end of the windscreen/windows are misplaced. So you have to do a bit of tweeking to try and get the proportions correct.<br><br>With the model of the Escort MKI RS shell (pictured above) the top and side view were fine, but the front and rear drawing were out,which makes me think that the width and hight are slightly out of proportion. This is where real photographs taken at various angles would come in handy (and hard to find for many projects unless you can get access the thing you are trying to create). <br><br>I know that there are a number of ways to set up reference image in a 3D application. One is to load the images as back drops (this is what I used for the car shell) and scale a cube object to two of the images and then scale the last image accordingly.<br><br>And another method that involves making 3 (or a few more) plane object that run along each modeing axis textured with the reference images.<br><br>At some point I will see if I fare better using plane objects in key places. But thats for later after I've finish playin with the wheel <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Right-o then.<br><br>dawlane: Your UV mapping is incredibly inefficient, and that's one place to start optimizing.  The way you're going about things, I could do better in 128x256 easily.  To start, you have the same plane of the wheel split into two separate blocks, and you aren't even organizing them very well.  They should have been the same part of the texture to start with.  Secondly, you're duplicating the same image for both sides of the wheel, which is just silly.  Thirdly, you could just as easily tile the treads of wheel, allowing you to have far more detail in the treads.<br><br>Also, might as well add more segments to the wheel.
