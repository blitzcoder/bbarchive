I'm announcing the first project by Chaos Theory Games. The Matriarch's Tomb: The Tempering is going to be sort of an experimental title, with a planned sequel to follow. The purpose of this project will be both to provide funds for our future work (price will be $9.99 when completed), and get feedback from customers on how to improve our future titles.<br><br>This project will be an arena style game, allowing the player to either progress through a scenario ladder of last man standing matches, or to play practice matches in last man standing, deathmatch, team deathmatch, or capture the flag games. The planned sequal will be a very different gametype, but more information will be released on that when the time comes.<br><br>Backstory removed pending update.<br><br>Temporary art replacement:<br><img src="http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y143/Jonathan16416/comingsoon.jpg"> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Currently we're looking at LMS, DM, Team DM, and CTF gametypes for practice matches, and LMS for the ladder scenario.<br><br>Each outfit will have team colors, but aside from that you can still pick whatever customizations you want for the team based games.<br><br>The planned sequal won't be an arena style game, but will have very similar playstyle, and I hope to integrate user feedback from this project into it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'll only be explaining what the tempering is, and why this time there's a prize to be had.<br><br>Summing it up:<br>The Tempering:<br>The Tempering is a form of training combat where the Matriarch's followers fight to the death to bolster their skills. Using alien resurrection technology, this allows them to learn from their mistakes and continue enhancing their skills, even if they lose.<br><br>The Matriarch:<br>An extradimensional being, trapped in a deathlike state on Earth. Her tomb is hidden, thanks to her advanced technology, but she relies on human followers for protection. A secret society, of sorts. There are other beings trapped on earth, with their own groups of cultists, which are far less benign, so it is neccessary for her followers to become adept fighters.<br><br>The Guardian:<br>The personnal guard of the Matriarch, this is her most skilled fighter. Imbued with great power by alien technology, she alone is trusted with the protection of the Matriarch's inner sanctum, the tomb itself. When the Guardian is slain, another is chosen with a special session of the Tempering. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
