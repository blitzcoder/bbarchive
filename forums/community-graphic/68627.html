Corner1 is interesting as it has no doorways.  It is interesting as there are no corridor or 'T'-sections that don't have doorways either (it would be nice if they were included)<br><br>There are 4 'T'-sections.  However, 'Tsection3' and 'Tsection4' appear to be the same mesh - I am suspicious that one of these sections is meant to be different.<br><br>There is a pre-made level - which is the one pictured in this thread.<br><br>There is a pre-made office room too - NOTE: this room contains meshes that are not available as single mesh files (although, you could technically separate them yourself):<br>Telephone<br>Wood-effect desk - matches the cofee table<br>Room partition/divider - has 2 eye-level windows at one end<br>Filing cabinet<br>Drinks machine - refrigerated fizzy/soda/soft drinks-type<br><br>There is a second, smaller, pre-made office.<br><br>The included, separate mesh, furnishings are:<br>Chair - this is a typist-type chair - black with blue fabric<br>Coffee table - a square wood-effect low table<br>Computer - (this is actually an LCD-type monitor)<br>Crate - a metallic sort of sci-fi crate<br>Desk - this is more like a reception-type desk<br>Blue fabric office-type sofa<br>Wall picture - sci-fi scene<br>Potted plant<br><br>All of the rooms/sections seem to have lighting in the ceilings - Yes the meshes are single-sided so you can't see the ceilings from above.  I find the lighting somewhat unsightly - in some areas the lighting is out of scale with other areas - the small office/room being a blatant example whereby the lights are ridicuously large.  EDIT: in fact, this is caused by the fact that the lights are re-used from the corridor sections - thus they blatantly can go out of scale.<br><br><br>In conclusion - this is all very good.  Good for a UFO/Laser Squad, turn-based, type of game (as an example).<br><br>However, I am concerned regarding 'Tsection3' and 'Tsection4' appearing to be the same mesh - I belive this to be an error. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

EDIT: In fact, it is looking for a 'Desk.BMP' texture that does not exist.<br><br><br>EDIT: From an FPS point of view:<br><br>One thing I have noted with the demo level is there are gaps in the geometry which you can see through - so you may want to set a ground plane below your level or a moving surface parented to the player/cam to mask those.  I don't see this as a major problem - but might be annoying for some people.<br><br>The drinks machine seems too tall and the monitors on the desks are too high - they are ideal to look at when standing up, but ridiculous for someone sitting at a desk.  The drinks machine is user-fixable but the monitor is a bit more tricky.  The room partition/divider now seems far too low - but this is user-fixable.<br><br>EDIT:<br>Use this as a rough guide (just to get you started):<br>Based on a 1.7 camera eye-height.<br>ScaleEntity level,.017,.017,.017<br><br>Set a ground plane at ,0,-.1,0<br>Colour the ground plane a darkish colour - remember though that the gaps in the geometry in the corridor-type sections go up the walls so setting it to black will look okay for the floor, but will stand out for the walls.  In addition, you will still have to set the CameraClsColor to compensate - perhaps setting this slightly less dark.<br><br>EDIT:<br>This is mainly if you were using the level for FPS-type play/cameras.  For a top-down/isometric game then you will probably not be too bothered.<br><br>EDIT:<br>In the demo level, there is an old hole (section of mesh missing) in the ceiling of Mesh13 which is the corner section to Mesh24 (The large empty room).  I've looked at the individual corner meshes and they seem fine - so, I cannot see problems building a level - this is just a problem with the example demo level. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
