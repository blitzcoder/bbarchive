Wow, you're really something. <br><br>We were talking about detail, not taste of what you feel objects should look like. As far as detail is concerened i am completely correct, a tiled bumpmap takes up less memory than a big lightmap. Only shabby artists cover up for "realism" by stretching or blurring the texture. You can have a high detail blur, a high detail soft material with a high detail bump map. Not that you'd need to but thats not what we were discussing, we were discussing that the quality of the detail would be higher with a bumpmap for the same amount of texture size. So yes, you can stretch your lightmap down to the "smoothness" you like, but then again you can stretch the bumpmap by the same emount and still take up squareroot amount of memory for it (Note specially for you: squareroot of a number is less than that number). So even in that sense i don't see how a huge lightmap could benefit you in any way. <br><br>How was i aggressive? Was it when i said "i will ignore you"? I didnt know that was aggressive, sorry if i scared ya. You however sounded like a rabid peasant's dog when you insulted me there. Once again, logic sucks doesn't it. <br><br>The thread may be in light vein, it's exactly the reason why i wasn't expecting an attempt at an insult, especially as i thought (tho that was a long time ago now) you weren't one of the retarded people on the forum.

(well, if you stretch your imagination a lil)...<br><br>i'm working on the sim right now... in both... so it's Blitz3D and 3DRAD as i find most useful...<br><br>i've also found that the ability to create the kind of graphics you want is also a major consideration that the game engine can only help you a lil bit with... and where as before i thought i could depend on the engine to make good looking games, i know better now, so the engine becomes less of a factor... <br><br>i mean, it is still a factor, but being able to get good graphics into it in the first place is a prerequisite...<br><br>i hope that provides some sort of answer... i should have some of the first shots from the game ready in a few days... subs will be in those... some of the best stuff i think i've come up with so far (at least i think so, others might not :)  )... and some less spectacular versions of the same stuff in 3DRAD...<br><br>which one i'll go with will depend on a few things which still are up in the air (networking, license security, and a few other things)... i'm getting to the point where i've gotta finish this now, or i'll never finish it...<br><br>--Mike <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
