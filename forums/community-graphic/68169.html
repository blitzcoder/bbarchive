I'd like to create some more interesting<br>rooms but there are a few constraints.  First - the rooms need to be relatively open, so I could cope with a few pillars or other obstacles but they should primarily be open - this would mean perhaps that any added detail would be symbols on the floor or grills/grates, perhaps some swaying tapestries on the walls or junk and bones<br>in the corners.  Blood stains and other detritus could litter the floor too.  <br><br>I'd like each room to feel like a generic dungeon room - in other words no purpose built rooms for things like kitchens/bedrooms/libraries or things like that.  Although they would look good I feel they'd be totally out of place in this game - where the player simply fights through a series of rooms collecting treasure and gaining power until a conclusion is reached.  These rooms would be recycled throughout the game session with different equipment and enemies present.<br><br>Would any people be interested in drawing some concepts for how I could 'populate' rooms that look something like this currently (see below). <b> Pencil/Paper/MSPAint sketches are more than acceptable to me as I only really need a guide / plan to work from </b>.  Perhaps, if anyone is willing, they could use the current images shown below as a base to add to and I will work on it from there.  <br><br><br>Sample rooms without decorations (and in dire need of redecorating/refurnishing) (these are scaled down from their full size of 1024x768 to 400x300)<br><br><img src="http://home.people.net.au/~Matthew.Lloyd/lloyd/BNP2/AlcoveRoomColorMap1.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://home.people.net.au/~Matthew.Lloyd/lloyd/BNP2/LongRoomColorMap1.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://home.people.net.au/~Matthew.Lloyd/lloyd/BNP2/TJunctionColorMap1.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://home.people.net.au/~Matthew.Lloyd/lloyd/BNP2/WideRoomColorMap1.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://home.people.net.au/~Matthew.Lloyd/lloyd/BNP2/crossroadcolorMap1.jpg"> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Unlike most story based rpgs I am not interested in having specific rooms like 'kitchen' 'courtyard' 'bathroom/bedroom' etc etc.  I am thinking more along the lines of a set of rooms which have the same look and feel (ie uniform/coherent) but which differ in their shape (for game play purposes) and their contents (ie skeletal remains, barrels, old shields, lumps of cloth and broken swords, bloodstains, worn tapestries fluttering in the breeze, torches on the walls) which are merely to reduce the repetitive nature of the gameplay.  <br><br>In the current game there are 6 different rooms, although the contents in terms of monster and equipment vary in their availability in each room - although not totally random.  I feel that the current types of rooms<br>( T Corridor, X Corridor, 4 way Room, Long Room with multiple exits, Long room with 1 exit, Broad room with multiple exits) are the minimum I'd like to include in the game.<br><br>I'd prefer to steer clear of 'single exit' rooms (the game is designed to only allow motion forwards into the dungeon not back to previously explored rooms - a bit like a Roguelike game).  <br><br>I'd also like to have the rooms be fairly open to allow for a lot of movement, as well as to not have too many obstacles in the main play area, although around the boundary is okay.  Most of the 'detail objects' (ie eye candy) should sit around the edge of the room or in out of the way places so that the player and the monsters have a large play area.  <br><br>Out of interest Pete - where are you writing from, I don't really know what the time difference is between where we both are.  I am in Melbourne, Australia and it is about 9:30pm right now.<br><br>Thanks for your assistance with this, it is greatly appreciated, very much.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Matt<br><br><br>EDIT - Making levels for this game of mine is pretty easy actually (the technical process).  It simply requires  minimum of 3 renders (or possibly 2). The first is the render of the scene, the second and third are renders of the scene with  gradient texture applied (from rgb=0 to rgb=height of texture) using an orthographic camera projection from above with one of these renders having the entire scene rendered and the other having only the walkable regions rendered.  To get an idea of how this works have a look in the tiles directory within the levels directory of the game folder. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Set the material for all objects in the scene to 'constant' - we don't want any lighting affecting the colors on the zmaps.<br>2.  Create another orthographic camera which is positioned above the level looking down onto it.  <br>3. Apply the gradient texture (shown below) to all the objects in the scene using a 'projection' from the camera created in step 2.  In other words we want the camera to act like a movie projector which projects the texture onto all the objects in the scene as if from the camera's viewpoint.<br><br>4.Render the scene from the original isometric camera view.  This gives us our first zmap 'scenezmap'.<br>5.Remove all the objects from the scene except the floor (or walkable areas).<br>6.Render the scene again from the original isometric camera's view.  This gives us our second zmap ('floorzmap')<br><br><br><br>Here is a copy of the gradient texture:<br><br><img src="http://home.people.net.au/~Matthew.Lloyd/lloyd/BNP2/GradientMedRes.png"><br><br>Here is a view from the isometric camera:<br><img src="http://home.people.net.au/~Matthew.Lloyd/lloyd/BNP2/Pic1.jpg"><br><br>Here is a view from the 'zmapcamera' (the one looking straight down):<br><br><img src="http://home.people.net.au/~Matthew.Lloyd/lloyd/BNP2/Pic2.jpg"><br><br>Here is a view with the gradient texture applied (note that I have been lazy and not textured the objects within the room - normally they would be as well using the same process.)<br><img src="http://home.people.net.au/~Matthew.Lloyd/lloyd/BNP2/pic3.jpg"> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'll give an example:<br><br>Open the file level1.gme in the levels directory, it should look like this:<br><br><pre class=code>

Scene Settings
backdropimage=Levels\Tiles\SceneColorMap1.png    &lt;--- Change this to the path to your new scene render
gamesizex=1024 &lt;--this must be the same size as your renders which should all be the same size
gamesizey=768 &lt;--as for gamesizex
lightmap=Levels\Tiles\SceneLightMap1.png &lt;--if you leave this blank the sprites are rendered full bright otherwise they are colored according to the color of the point where their 'feet' are on the lightmap.  The lightmap can be at a lower resolution so in this case I think I used 256x192
backdropzbuffer=Levels\Tiles\SceneZMap1.png &lt;--this is the zmap for the whole scene
backdropfootzbuffer=Levels\Tiles\SceneFloorZMap1.png &lt;--this is the zmap for the floor / walkable area
zbufferbitdepth=4 &lt;--leave this as 4.  
backdropwalkablearea=Levels\Tiles\SceneCollisionMap1.png  &lt;--this is the map which shows where the player can walk, 2 color white=walkable, black = impassable.  



</pre><br><br><br>Changing the above file will cause the first level to be changed, useful for testing.  I do have an editor for placing things in the levels and may send it if you want it.  <br><br><br>Although I don't want to make use of this feature in this particular game it is possible to have animated backgrounds which also animate the zmap (such as when  door swings/slides open so as to correctly occlude sprites when the background changes), animated lightmaps (such as when lighting changes in points on the scene), and animated collision maps (once again useful for things like doors or other points you may imagine.  And these animations can be a small section of the scene if desired (usually so). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
