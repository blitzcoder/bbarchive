Perhaps taking it down (or even completely off) and carefully adding an appropriate level of fog, might look better. Key thing here would be to use <a href="http://i400.photobucket.com/albums/pp84/gpetrics/IMG_0764blow.jpg" target="_blank">real-life</a> as <a href="http://img682.imageshack.us/img682/7932/antarcticaseaicecoronat.jpg" target="_blank">reference</a> to see if there is bloom or not (and it looks really like it doesn't). I seriously think a somewhat dense fog would give it a much better look.<br><br>But I notice some strange pixel patterns, moirée like in the middle to far ground of each scene. Large areas with a strange plotting. Especially in the first screen (it's most noticeable there). <br><br>Looking at the character's cloak texture in the 3rd picture, it seems you are using Nearest-Neighbour filtering? perhaps trying linear or other might turn out better results. Come to think of it, the grey\blueish parts of the snow also show that "nearest-neighbour" aspect (looking at the 4th pic), with hard parts. Are you using Nearest as a default filter for everything?<br><br>I'd love to see a video of it in action (with sound); might be even better to see if what I said is really true.<br><br>Good luck with your project. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

At first, I just assumed it was down to the JPEG compression of the screenshots, but then I noticed that they're PNG's, so I guess that's not it.<br><br>All around the girl's hands in the first screen there are lines radiating out. On the right mountain peak in the second screen, there are banding artifacts all down that, and what looks like a fingerprint in the middle of the screen.<br><br>On top of that everything is really pixellated. I don't think it's just lack of AA either. Partially it seems as though you're using alpha masking instead of alpha blending, at least on the woman's robes. Everything in the distance seems very pixellated too though, and much than I would expect from mere lack of AA.<br><br>Additionally, the shadows also have a lot of artifacts. There's already a pretty huge offset from the base of the character, so I'm guessing more blurring will only make that worse. Perhaps you could afford to increase the number of samples being taken for the shadows.<br><br>Out of interest, what graphics engine are using for this now? Is this Horde3D, Leadwerks or Phyre? The screenshots you posted before with Horde3D were very impressive, and didn't seem to exhibit these problems. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you are using LWE, the shadows are supposed to look bad.  If you are not using LWE, then you really don't want your project looking like it was made with LWE.<br><br>As mentioned by somebody else, everything is really pixellated and it looks like it was done with LWE.  Again, if you are using LWE, this is the way it should look as every LWE shot looks pixellated.  If you are not using LWE, then you really don't want your project looking like it was made with LWE. <br><br>The character's hands seem to have some proportion issues.  Image #3 &amp; #4 really show this off.  The hands and fingers seem abnormally large.<br><br>Unlike others, the bright snow looks normal to me.  This game level isn't the inner city where snow is dirty and shades of gray.  Snow is supposed to be VERY bright in the Sun (This is where the term Snow blindness came from.) and very "glowy" under the moonlight.<br><br>Above things aside, I like the level design.  Without knowing what the game is about, I would guess a post-apocalyptic RPG style.  Whatever it is, it looks very interesting looking to me.  <br><br>With the exception of the hands, all the other issues (shadows, pixellation) could solely be attributed to LWE if you are using LWE (every LWE shot will always and does always have these same issues), so it really isn't fair to blame you for the limitations/problems of the engine.  However, if you are not using LWE, then these things could likely be improved.  Like I said before, you really do not want your game to look like it was made with LWE.<br><br>At the end of the day, as long as the publisher is happy, you should be too. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
