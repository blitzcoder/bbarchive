I can also tell that not a whole lot of care usually goes into making sure you don't have four or five 512x512 textures loaded on one model (that end up looking quite blurry up close), and some of those textures may have been taken from copyrighted sources ... and a lot of them end up being very noticable when tiled (take the roof on one of those arteria models, for example)<br><br>When someone says "What can you expect for $10," well ... that's what you can expect from me.

I'd imagine you might be able to make those for yourself, eventually.<br><br>Tyler:<br><br>I had a look over it, you got just a very few polys that could quite possibly still be culled, but I bet it would not make too much difference unless there were an awful lot of them in frame at once (we're talking thousands in one shot I'd estimate)<br><br>In General:<br><br>Why do some think that an artist must be paid badly, and generally treated in a mouldy fashion? Artists can be your friends, why not start treating them that way?<br><br>A little trade secret: I got two machines that I funded and which are made available for client work. If a client starts down the "same goods for less money" route, their work automatically goes on the slower one of the two. If they play nice, they get treated nice, but I always leave the choice to them. I have been at this long enough to know the value of a given model, through experience I am in a good position to know that and be right most of the time by now. Why a potential client might feel they know more about it than me is hard to say, but I've had the scars that taught me to know what I'm talking about. After all that's how come they decided to approach me in the first place. If they wanted cheap and nasty they should have gone to the guy next door, because I don't do that sort of stuff, and that's because there's no honest way to earn a living doing that.<br><br>About levels of detail:<br><br>This is a games making forum, it's not a museum's historical documentation and visualisation forum. Counting beams and knowing their names indeed. Not at these prices you don't! ;O) Of course some will think at this point, "but why not make it the best it can be?", I'd say that we already threw all quality issues out the window when we started talking cheap.<br><br>If the software you want to use it in is cheap and nasty, then heck yes, get cheezey models too, they'll not look out of place. If you care about how your programs look, then buy some decent models to use in them.<br><br>A thought that you might see as worth considering:<br><br>Like any other decent artist, I always try to be a good guy for my clients, offering fair value for money;<br><br>That issue about the colour of roof tiles; I'd automatically expect to fix that for no extra charge if the customer could tell me what they wanted. It's not a problem as I'd have made the orignal artwork and could therefore change it to suit their stated need.<br><br>Of course with cheap stuff, the "artist" might say it's going to be that colour as I could not find any other sort on the world wide web! We all know you'd have not paid anything like top dollar at that point, you'd know exactly what kind of artist you got for the figure you <b><i>were</i></b> prepared to pay.<br><br>At these sorts of prices, it's commonly accepted that there would be no textures anyway. Being ahead of the game often depends on knowing when you are ahead of the game. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

What Pete pointed out is correct, and that's only one reason it would cause a quality issue. On the other hand, if I add the detail of those crossbeams directly to the texture, it will cause blurring since the beams (overall) will take up relatively thin strips of texture area (and it's very noticable next to the higher quality wood-grain of the outter supports). If I make it larger, it creeps into inefficient, and that's not worth the visual stimulus since most people will end up cutting it back anyway.<br><br>@Gabriel - I don't believe that statement to be true. It's my responsibility to not produce a texture that is too large to be efficient, forcing buyers to take the initiative to cut the resolution, and thus the quality. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
