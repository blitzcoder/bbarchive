This would also account for the lack of a firing pin mechanism at the base of the barrels as I'm presuming some form of magnetic propellant similar in concept to the 'gauss gun' or 'rail gun'. Though of course I'm not an engineer or a gun buff and only have my imagination to work with. :p <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If it could, the battery would drain really quick. A more realistic option would probably be to gas-power the barrel, drawing from the bulets' explosion. The loading mechanism I added was a last-minute addon when I realized that there's no way for the bullets to reach the barrels. If I was designing a <i>real</i> gatling gun, I would definitely put most of my thought to the loading and firing mechanism, since this is definitely the most important.<br><br>This gun was "designed" to fire at rates of up to 60 bullets <i>every second</i>! This makes it impracticle and absolutely unrealistic in many ways, but only has it's use in fiction. If a gatling pistol like this was really designed and built (I'm sure it's possible), when it gets up to speed the constant recoil would virtually throw you across the room. If each bullet was .20-.30 calaber and was fired at a little over 1000 FPS, recoil for EACH BULLET would be over <b>7 pounds</b> (taking into consideration the weight of the gun). Multiply that by 60 and you've got <b>420 pounds of "thrust"</b> EVERY SECOND. Definitely not practical. That's why this is titled "XG100 Gatling Pistol Model <i>(Fictional)</i>".<br><br><div class="quote"> As it is designed now, it might be a useful kitchen appliance. <br></div><br>I disagree. As it is designed now, it might be useful as a small rocket engine.<br><br><div class="quote"> looks like a 0.5 mm bullet <br></div><br>The scale of the gun is deceiving. It would actually be quite large if designed, much heavier than the averange hand gun. This is because the weight must be maximum to absorb the most recoil, and since the it's got 6 barrels. This gun definitely could not be held with one hand.<br><br><div class="quote"> Why would you want a high rate of fire in a handgun? <br></div><br>Because the barrels will not reach their peak speed instantly, it can be used as a semi-automatic. And the high fire rate could be used if you wanted to take out a few tanks or aircraft (depending on whether you're using armor piercing or frangible bullets). <br><br>:) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

IMO, this not only looks worse, but looks more bland with such a featureless gun. Like I said before, I <i>could</i> design this to actually work in real life, but there's always the point where you draw the line between reality and fiction. In this case, I went into reality as far as to include a battery, an electric motor, and the 6 barrels.<br><br>I am NOT justifying it as being "fictional" because it wouldn't work in real life; as you can clearly see the title of this post included "(Fictional)" before you ingeniously rediscovered that fact by looking at it's mechanics. From the very beginning of it's design I was quite aware that a gatling pistol would never work out in real life and therefore went for a more interesting design rather than a more bland but realistic one. An orange sphere called the "Doomsday Macine" would not only be unrealistic, but boring and stupid, so I don't think that's a fair analogy. Now if you think the motor mechanism looks ugly, that's your opinion and you're completely entitled to it.<br><br>If I made a ray gun, would you say, "That's stupid because that can't work in real life."? Of course a ray gun can't work in real life! It's fiction. Now when they start inventing ray guns I suppose you'll send a nice letter of complaint to every game and movie studio in the industry describing in detail their design flaws in their ray-guns and how they should make it look like it'll <i>really</i> work, even though doing so may make them look clunky and unattractive. Well, you're entitled to you're own opinion, but I doubt if any self respecting game or movie studio would respond to a comment like this. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
