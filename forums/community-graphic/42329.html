This is one of the most asked for  features on many forums. People are tired of always getting the same setup on their favorite guns. They want to spec them out with appropriate parts for each mission. Like to door breach? mod your gun with a masterkey system(shot gun option) or maybe you like blowing stuff up then go for the grenade launcher. Think the 4X zoom scope is a little much for room clearing? Trade it in for trijicon or iron sites. You could go crazy and even allow them to choose the bullet type, magazine size(C-Mags) and add laser and or flashlights. You could build 5 of your favorite setups and allow them to  choose depending on their map or position. <br>I think this is a great idea. <br><br>Regards <br>Gnu <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It allows you to create weapons that behave differently without the need to buy a whole new weapon. This is very economic and would be fun to toy with in a game.<br><br>The only problem is that the interchangable parts concept means large heavy weapons, so pre-built guns (like M16 or Mk 23 SOCOM) should also be available for a less versatile but more tactical firearm, like for special ops that are in for a quick sweep of a small area where they won't really have the time or the need to reconfigure their weapon on the field.<br><br>A game design concept I propose is that the player has money to spend on parts for his weapon(s). In the beginning, though, he starts with no money and only entry-level modules required to piece together a complete weapon. If you're thinking an arena game like Unreal Tournament, then every arena game you finish earns you more money for parts. Or if you're thinking an adventure FPS game like Half-Life or Call of Duty then I guess you find modules on the go.<br><br>The player is allowed to have as many weapons as he or she wants but a maximum of 2 complete guns can be chosen to take into a deathmatch fight (whether this be single player or multiplayer) and cannot be reconfigured during the game.

Imagine a weapon that evolved differently dependent on the components that assembled it. It would be like Digimon or <i>DigiGun should I say - hehe</i>.<br><br><div class="quote"> The only problem is that the interchangable parts concept means large heavy weapons <br></div> Maybe...Maybe not.  If every aspect of the weapon can be upgraded it will not matter. <br><br>For example, in a Sci-Fi setting, lets say you upgrade to the "Utopia" Chamber that features a Triple Chamber design with 3 barrel/Magazine/FireUnit slots. With the "Utopia" your "Devatron" weapon can be assembled into a Machine Gun/Bazooka Launcher/ Sniper Beam Weapon.<br><br>Of course, the "Utopia" is compact, and so are the "Grittle" Machine Gun Fire Unit, the "Z-Range" Sniper Barrel/Fire Unit/Magazine Assembly, the "Hercules Spitter" Magazine and "Gorge" Heavy Barrel that construct your "Devatron". <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Unfortunately, I don't have a good background story for GunVertor FPS. In fact, I dont have a story at all. <br><br>I was thinking along the lines of a Sci-Fi <i>Zombie</i> Shooter in which normally good human-like servant Robots are infected with the ZombiX Virus. The virus destroys their AI Brains and Alloy exoskeletons  transforming them into relentless 'Flesh Eating' decayed machines. The protagonist must find the source of the ZombiX Virus to annilihate it and restore order. Along the way, they must dismember and decapitate hordes of 'ZomBotz'. <br><br>I need a good story to fuel the game design:( <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

An organization (corperation or cult group, I dunno) is in the prototype phase of developing a way to re-animate dead organisms. In testing this method in a controlled environment, they had no success in directing the re-animated bodies, so the project is put away until they can rework their method into something that can be put to practical use.<br><br>An accident occurs and the 'method' (a virus maybe, but it would throw the whole story into a rip-off of Resident Evil) is released into an uncontroled environment and has become difficult to control or quarentine, so there's tons of 'undead' creatures everywhere (in a research center?) and a few scientists who were in an air-tight room during the outbreak have not been affected (yet).
