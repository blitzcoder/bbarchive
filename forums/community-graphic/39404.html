This song really doesnt go anywhere, its so basic im not even sure it would pass as menu music. "Piano riff" ? It sounds like a piano practice tune or something. I suggest you make it 1 minute long and put it on repeat. Or even better make the sounds mix in at random so it sounds "nearly different" cos that way you will cut down file size and make it more loopable. This is a loop, right? The noise in the background also sounds plastic, was that a MIDI sound patched in some soundediting app or something?<br><br>"Regret" sounded better at the beginning. Putting vocals in a game rarely works. Especially this kind of awfuly cheesy love song, oh my god. Better put Justin Timberlake if you want to put this in Alien Breed. He can at least sing better than that singer. His voice is so wobbly he wouldnt even pass as american idol lol! This song is trying TOO hard to sound like a generic tune, its incredible. It sounds like i heard it so many times before, maybe on a pregenerated synth tune, you know one of those? Then just vocals on top. And at the end "Time to move on" oh far out, someone needs singing lessons. Hire a normal singer, ey? The production itself is ok, considering how you probably did it. But again that plastic sound is squeezed in, that 90s techno-dance spice... heheh...<br><br>"Sanxion". A remake, ok. Cheese and more cheese. This is the 80s now, right? They had different cheese in 80s i think. Yea. This tune is all over the place, no shape or form, too much even for a synth dance tune like that. What is the song trying to achieve? Nothing? Or just piss people off. And then it repeats of course. The scratching sound in the rear is very "Amiga" tho, and it nearly makes me remember my GameBoy days. Theres also a sound in it that makes me think of Mario popping out of a tube at one point. "Electric strings" are all over the middle of the song again using one or two basic shapes and trying to combine into something specific but the lack of musical knowledge is audible. The end of the song sounds like a news bulletin just ended. <br><br>Megablast is pretty good, well done that one.<br><br>Thats ok, i never ever heard any game music that was anywhere near great quality, maybe rarely some ambiental stuff works... But maybe this isnt for a game? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I totally accept that it doesn't really go anyway, there are loads of subtle layers that you can't hear at this quality though which is a shame cos there are some nice little filter sweeps and stuff. The clean sounds (piano, oboe, strings) were from my Korg sound module that has superb clarity and quality. The drums I think were from the Yammy DJX.<br><br>Regret, Never intended for a game, just a track I wrote, I sang it (badly) as I mentioned above and I'm not a singer (as mentioned above). This I actually did on a multitrack just playing all the bits live. As soon as I've got a singer it'll be redone, as I said, it was a demo.<br><br>Sanxion, It's a remake, I didn't write it, and yes it was supposed to be cheesey! I'm guessing you've not heard the original as I've not changed the structure much at all. Most of the strings and melody sounds were from my Akai vintage sound module, it's jam packed full of 80's synths sounds, this was done so it sounds more like the SID and have a retro feel, the whoos and yeahs are maybe a little over cheesey, but it was supposed to be fun.<br><br>Megablast, was also supposed to be cheesey! Well, cheesey in a grow a mullet and shoe-horn yourself into tight jeans kinda way. I found my overdrive pedal and had fun! All played live into Acid then arranged.<br><br>Anyway Lenn, I thought you were going to ignore me after you said "I can't imagine Rob now as anything other than a sad pathetic small creature in a dark room, angry at the whole world." <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
