However, I'd like to address a few points that you made in response to my initial post:<br><br>You say that the grammatical mistakes are easy enough to remove. If this is the case, why didn't you remove them from the preview? It seems to me that if the problems are present and noticeable from the very fist sentence onwards, you might want to brush up on your craft (because there is a "nuts and bolts" craft to writing, it isn't all style and creativity) before you think about publishing.<br><br>Regarding your argument that I didn't read far enough into the story to get a feel for your writing style or to get to the hook that you claim is on page three:<br><br>First impressions count; potential customers will, whether you like it or not, make an almost instantaneous value judgement based on the first thing they read. Our free time is valuable to us and your work is competing with countless other forms of entertainment that we might choose to enjoy. If you are dismissive of people who make quick judgements based on the first few sentences of your work then you are dismissing almost all of your potential readership.<br><br>Your argument seems to be along the lines of "the start might be unengaging but if you just keep reading..." Well, no. It doesn't work like that. Why should I invest more of my valuable free time in reading on when I can pick up another story that works from the get go? Why shouldn't I watch a movie instead? Or go out? Or listen to music? Or do any one of countless things that I might enjoy more than I enjoyed your opening sentences?<br><br>Your first few sentences, paragraphs, and chapters should be able to answer this. Think of your opening sentence (and paragraph) as a hook, a lure. You want use this literary moment to get your story hooks into your potential readers and say "Look, you've gotta read this. It's worth your time. It's worth your money. I'm not gonna let you go, no matter how much you wriggle!"<br><br>Work on your craft, Jose. You should know this stuff. Read a few "how to write fiction" books. Join that Critters website that I suggested in a previous thread.<br><br>How do I know that your work is cliched? I don't. The story might be mind-bogglingly original but I'll never know because at the beginning you heap on the genre cliches. Why should I trust that your story will get better? Why would I bet my hard-earned money that it will?<br><br>I'm sorry if my original post seemed too brutal. I'm sure that it bruised your feelings. The general reading public, professional publishers, and critics are no less mean, and often significantly more so than I am. Believe it or not, I genuinely want to help you, Jose.<br><br>I want to read a fantastic future story from you; something amazing, something that I can't put down until I've lapped up every word. You've got it in you to do this. And if you can amaze and captivate me then you can amaze and captivate an audience, because I'm just one of many people who likes reading good fiction.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The old chapter 1(Modified a little) will probably become<br>chapter 2 or 3.<br><br>So without further ado, here it is (Be warned this is a <i> very </i> rough draft of the idea. I need to jazz it up a bit, and make it slightly less cliche, but I think this will work nicely as a 'hook')<br><br>We crept silently through the graveyard, stopping every few feet to listen for the moans. All was silent except for the spatter of rain drops. We walked further through the overgrown grass, headed for the crypt where they’d told us it lived. Or unlived I suppose since our prey was of the undead persuasion. Let us just say ‘haunted’ to avoid confusion.<br>  Kate reached it first, motioning for me to stay back and keep an eye out for an ambush. I didn’t like letting her go in alone, but she had a point. This zombie was supposed to be pretty clever, and setting up an ambush was just the kind of thing it might do…<br>  She pushed the crypt door open carefully, one hand glowing with flame to give her light, and walked inside. Kate’s footsteps died away a few minutes later and she was lost to my sight. <br>  I sent up a silent prayer to the Good Lord to keep an eye on her. Kate might not believe in God, but I certainly did, and would feel a lot happier if I knew he was on our side.<br>  The downpour increased in fury, threatening to flood the whole graveyard, so I crouched behind a nearby headstone for what shelter it would offer. I’m not sure how long I waited back there, certainly at ten minutes, but it was then that I heard it. Amidst the pouring of the rain had been a distinctly different note, something that sounded out of place. I listened hard and heard it again. The steady flip-flop of footsteps.<br>  Carefully, so as not to be spotted, I raised my head to look in the direction I’d heard the noise coming from and saw a humanoid figure shambling towards the crypt. Behind it was another, and behind that, another, and another, and another, and another. There were a whole line of zombies headed for the crypt. And Kate had no idea…<br>  Leaping up from my hiding place, I ran towards the entrance, nearly slipping on the wet grass.<br>  “Kate!” I screamed out, but I doubt she heard me above the rain.<br>  A few of the zombies turned to look at me, but most of them continued their single-minded advance towards the crypt.<br>  Running and leaping over headstones, I made it within a few yards of the crypt entrance, before my path was blocked by three of them.<br>  They didn’t look much like the zombies you see in movies. These weren’t covered in blood, and didn’t have glowing eyes and fangs, and didn’t look like patchwork humans with several bits missing. Basically, they were just dead bodies. Slightly decomposed in places, and one of them was missing his eyes, but by and large, they just looked like secondhand human beings.<br>  One of them lunged at me, but I easily stepped aside. The movies at least had that part right. These guys were slow. Their only real threat lay in their numbers, and probable durability.<br>  Grinning, I dived past the other two and ran down the crypt steps, shouting out Kate’s name as I went.<br><br><br>And of course, there's a bit more to this. This is just a preview to see if it works as a 'hook'. (And I have yet to write the rest, lol).<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
