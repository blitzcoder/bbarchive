Their purpose is for modification to make other characters; basically they exist so you need not start from scratch but rather start from how they are now ( modelled and optimized ) and with your fav modeller modify/change them etc to build new characters. Then you can rig and animate your new character model.<br><br>So yah! You basically buy the base mesh so you don't have to start from scratch. <br><br>hmm! I think I repeated myself a few times in this post, I'm very tired so apologies if my reply here is somewhat disorganized.<br><br>Ta! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Also that "black" quad at the male pelvis looks kind of misplaced (while the one at the female model looks nice) - maybe one could improve that spot a bit.<br>The buttocks of the female model has a "triangle like" polygon on each half - which is modeled better on the male model. Hmm and the knees on both.. they use multiple triangles (i think you used them for deformation purposes) but I think you could remove some of them.<br><br>The above is a personal review of the model screenshots you provided. I just wonder what makes it worth the price of $35 - compared to "Make Human" and other free base models (some of them already contain rigs...).<br><br>Please take it as a personal opinion and not as a rant, I just mentioned some things which sprang to my eye.<br><br>PS: I suggest to also provide product pictures with subdivide-modifiers - there you see how the model looks without further modification. Normally this should improve the models render output quite a lot.<br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
