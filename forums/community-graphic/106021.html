Thanks for the comments.<br><br>VIDEO:<br><br><iframe width="560" height="345" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abpEWQCW1t0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><br>if the video doesn't play, here's a direct link:<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abpEWQCW1t0" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abpEWQCW1t0</a><br><br>Here's a 3 minute bit of clips showing how it looks moving about in 3D. It runs between 50 and 61 fps, but FRAPS doesn't like recording while running my game, so the recording got pretty jerky. When FRAPS isn't running, it's really smooth. I think FRAPS dropped it down to just 15 or something!<br><br>@ Volturna: I walked close to the water in the video. At the moment, it is a semi-transparent plane, with a wavy texture applied to it. The plane rises and falls a bit, so it 'comes up' and down the shoreline. I want to make some wave images to lap up against the shore when the player is near the water to make it look better - so it's a work in progress :)<br><br>@ Hotshot2005 - thanks!<br><br>@ RemiD: you're right about the lighting on the scenery - they're all photographs, and there's no commonality in their lighting/ leaf shadows. I'll take a look at that and edit the photos, so that they are all displaying lighting from a similar direction. You are right, it looks a bit random at the moment so I'll want to improve on that. For the moment, I'm just trying to populate the world with scenery objects to get an idea of it all.<br><br>Buildings:<br>My first goal is to make simple models of everything, then get all the gameplay running. Then to make more complex buildings and architecture. I want a slider in settings, that lets people add or lessen the detail level, according to computer performance.<br><br>Shadows:<br>It will look better once shadows are in there. At the moment, the only shading I've done is to do some simple shading baked onto the landscape texture, but there is no shading or shadows relating to scenery at the moment. That's on my to-do list :)<br><br>Billboards:<br>When I tried to make a program that used actual 3D models - it wouldn't even run, and I've got a high end gaming PC. So the only way to have an expansive landscape with long draw distances and lots of scenery objects, etc, with DirectX 7, seems to be by billboarding a lot of the scenery. The main frame killer is the hedging. There's almost 30,000 hedge billboards on the island at the moment. I'm still not sure what to do there - basically, all the fields are to have low walls or hedge walls surrounding them. I tried to do it in 3D models, but had a lot of difficulty with it, so then I thought 'I'll just dot billboards of hedge images all around the outside of the fields' and that is working for now. I still would like to make some sort of actual 3D wall / hedgerow lines, but the landscape is curvy and hilly, and I had trouble working out how to shape 3D walls / hedges to the landscape.<br>I think some people will be put off by the billboarding scenery, but anyone who enjoyed old games like Daggerfall or Might Magic Vi, etc, will know that you get used to it, and after a while, your brain stops saying "that's a billboard!" and gets immersed in the feel and mood of the game. So, this game is for people whose gameplay experience isn't ruined by billboarding effects. But if I can get a better alternative working, I certainly will. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
