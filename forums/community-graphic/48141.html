Personally I would do him with the palms facing down though, as is his arms are twisted close to as far back as they will comfortably go and could twist about 220 degrees or more forward while maybe only 20 or so back.

Yup...<br><br><div class="quote"> <br>Normal Map Formats <br><br>Since a normal map is a way to use color data to represent surface normals, there are several ways that the color data can be used - or several normal map "formats." In order for your normal map to give you the correct results, the program that generates the normal map and the program (or shader) that uses the normal map must use the same format. <br><br><br>Tangent Space vs Object Space vs World Space<br><br>The main way in which normal map formats differ is in what "space" they use. "Space" refers to the point of reference for the X,Y, and Z values (the R,G, and B of the normal map). All of the info that I've been discussing in my tutorials so far has been covering normal maps created in "Tangent Space." <br><br>Tangent Space normal maps use texture coordinate space, so X and Y are the U and V of the texture coordinates and Z is the surface normal. Tangent space normal maps appear mostly light blue (127,127,255) because the Blue channel represents the direction that the underlaying model surface is facing. The red (X) and green (Y) channels are for offseting that direction. Tangent Space normal maps are best used on characters that deform and when tilable normal maps need to be applied to curved surfaces in the environment. <br><br>Object Space normal maps use the orientation of the model as their X, Y, and Z. Y is most commonly in the direction of the top of the model while X is to the left of the model and Z in the direction the model is facing. Object Space normal maps usually appear rainbow colored because they represent normals that face in every direction instead of just a 180 degree hemisphere like Tangent Space normal maps. Object Space normal maps can be used on rigid objects that need to rotate and have a unique set of texture coordinates (not a tiled texture). <br><br>World Space normal maps are very similar to Object Space normal maps - except they use the X, Y, and Z of the world as their coordinates. They also appear rainbow colored. Because they depend on the world coordinates, you can't rotate a model with a World Space normal map and have the lighting still appear correctly. For that reason, World Space normal maps can only be used on static objects that have a unique set of texture coordinates. <br> <br></div><br><br><a href="http://www.monitorstudios.com/bcloward/tutorials_normal_maps11.html" target="_blank">http://www.monitorstudios.com/bcloward/tutorials_normal_maps11.html</a><br><br>Oh, and very nice model, Tiggy! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The feet could be slightly bigger and give him some more grounding.<br><br>Some strength in his lower legs (the upper seems quite all right). The anatomy on the feet isn't quite right either - it's too far done. Feet don't have great detail, even with championship bodybuilders, and that is part of the problem Veins on top are ok but not on the rear of the ankle.<br><br>I like this model, and he looks great rotating.<br><br>I would want to make his chest tighter and more muscular because his arms indicate he's worked out to a greater level than what can be seen.<br><br>It seems to me that you have varying levels of physical fitness to him without thought to his story and how much he did work out to get to that point.
