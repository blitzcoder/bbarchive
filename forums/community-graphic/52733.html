As it happens... I'm not... So apologies for my arrogance here.<br><br>You spaceship doesn't appear to have any way of landing so it must be a space only vessel (or at least some kind of hover and dock situation)<br><br>It has wings which suggests that it is designed to work in atmosphere.<br><br>It has no visible çockpit so it might be pilot less.<br><br>The engines look like conventional jet engines which suggests atmosphere, however, they don't look like they would pivot and they look like the only form of propulsion so the hover and dock thing is out and only leaves space to dock, but, jet engines won't work in space...<br><br>My point... And I will get to one eventually...<br><br>I think you need to work out how the thing is going to work (like with your gatling pistol), where it will work etc etc. So if it's an atmosphere based craft it should have landing gear of sorts, if it's space based then you don't need wings or aerodynamics generally (no air, no friction).<br><br>How many people is this going to hold? How are they going to get in and out of the ship?<br><br>When you think about how things go together the design actually works better and makes sense.<br><br>You might think, right, I want a space ship that works in atmosphere and space... So you need wings, landing gear and rockets propulsion, and probably some docking point on it to allow it to dock with other ships/space stations.<br><br>Anyway...

This would also account for the large engines that don't pivot. Once in space only smaller manuever thrusters would be needed, similar to NASA's shuttle.<div class="quote"> You spaceship doesn't appear to have any way of landing so it must be a space only vessel <br></div>Surely the landing gear would just be retractable like almost all modern flying vehicles, especially if it has to break atmosphere as re-entry would just snap off any fixed landing gear.<br><br>To me it looks fine.

There's nothing wrong, in my opinion, with constructive criticism. Although I don't need to invent a actually-working warp drive just so I can make this my engines look "realistic", I should have put more thought into it's landing capabilities. Currently the landing gear (wheels) would extend from the fuselage, where it would land like an airplane. But then what's the advantage of this over an aircraft? If I thought of hovering capability, it probably would have turned out alot better.
