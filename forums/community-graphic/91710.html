I remember clearly my german neighbours kids didn't believe me when I told them about the genicode, about gas chambers etc. It was explicitely excluded in their schools history lessons. Besides, the reason why the illustration of swastika is prohibited is: many people supported the nazi regime and the allies were afraid they could continue to glorify these symbols. Therefor any glorification is strictly forbidden. But you can see it often in movies. Of course, pro nazi movies are forbidden. Since the Disnazification that was forced in Austria and Germany after 45 by the allies, there wasn't a single Artist who was successful if he didn't follow the rules of the new leaders. There weren't many parties left who had the skills to rule the land, the BRD was founded at 23. may 49 and was politically dominated by masons and jews until today, some of those who survived the nazi camps.<br><br>So it isn't illegal to use the swastika as long as it isn't glorified. It just doesn't make sense to walk around with a swastika. But when you are telling a story about WW2, no matter if it's a movie or a game, then, by the meaning of the law, it isn't prohibited.<br><br>But you cannont always count on german Judges. Most of them remained in their position after WW2... So it isn't surprising that they often act in a fashistoid way, even if politically 100% correct. EG. when they would say swastikas are ok in movies, but not in a game because a game is not art. Saying a Game is no artwork sounds like saying a certain race is not a real human being. Oh man, it's getting political. I guess I better stop here.<br><br>Nice model BTW. Were they meant as kamikaze bombs? Kindof man-controlled missiles. I remember there was a female test pilot, she tested these things (early jet engine tests), in Penemünde and so on. She said is was extremly hard to control, but also extremly kicking the adrenalin level due to a speed that was never seen before. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
