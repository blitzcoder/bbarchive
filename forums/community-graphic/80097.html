Makes the overall background more interesting to look at.  <br><br>* Added buttons to resize the window.<br><br>* Chose a new font and color for the grid text.  Made the letters smaller.  May make them a bit larger again for final game.<br><br><img src="http://raccoonrocket.com/WordSleuth-Mockup.jpg"><br><br><br>So, I've been thinking about the gameplay, and I think what I'm going to do is this:<br><br>I'll have the grid of letters, but there will be blank spaces where letters are missing.  So instead of finding "sherlock" the player might instead circle "s erlock" or even " he lock".  Not all blank spaces may be part of words in the list however, and not all words in the list may have missing letters on the grid.<br><br>The point of these missing letters is not only to make the puzzle a bit more difficult and interesting, but also the letters which are missing from the words in the word list will spell a bonus word when unscrambled, and the player will need to guess that at the end of the round for more points.<br><br>The player will also get more points for finding words fast.  So if they find a word within 30 seconds, they get a bonus.  This will probably involve some sort of timer which counts down, with time being added as each word is found, and bonus points being tallied at the end of the round based on how many minutes remain on the clock. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

And looks like it's floating a couple of millimetres above the table. And with this rough look has a perfectly formed Times like font.<br><br>Then next to it you've got a cartoon notepad which has lines so clean it just doesn't match the rough of the parchment thingy. And yet has hand written style font.<br><br>It just doesn't 'fit' in my opinion, I think photographing the same scene and getting the computer to interact with it would be consistant to the hand written feel of the notepad. I don't know if the parchment is supposed to be printed or hand written, if it's printed then surely it wouldn't be a thick torn olde worlde thing... <br><br>It just seems a bit confused to me. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Or a gold plaque conveniently mounted beneath the notepad with the words "Main Menu" on it.  <br><br>And if none of those elements makes sense, then does it really matter if the parchment is thicker than expected, or if some things have texture when needed to convey what they are, while other things do not... as long as it looks pretty?<br><br>But anyway, if we're going to talk about people who can't take criticism, perhaps you should take a look in the mirror.

Looked bland.<br><br>Also, if you think about it, a paper can cast a longer shadow if the light source is off to the side.  I'm not sure why it looks like it's floating.  Maybe because of how the drop shadow is just a copy of the layer's mask, and a real shadow would be connected to the paper at the top right and lower left corners.  But really don't want to have to draw all my shadows manually.  Makes it a lot harder to adjust them.<br><br><br><div class="quote"> Oh, and add a coffee cup stain! <br></div><br><br>Hm... maybe I'll try doing that to the desk.  I have some stains handy that I made for a texture CD a long time ago.  As for the paper, the whole things gonna be covered in letters and so I think you wouldn't be able to see it there really, and if it was dark enough that you could, it would probably affect the readability.

I removed a color cast on the parchment and brightened it up a bit.  I also made the lighting on the table a bit more contrasty which also increased the color saturation of it a bit.

I tried adding those coffee stains GFK suggested to the desk but they didn't really work well.<br><br>At first glance, it seems easier to read the grid letters now and the red outline stands out more, but I may have overadjusted it a bit.  I'll have to take another look at it later and compare it the last few versions to see if I went too far.  It's so hard to adjust colors.  When you're doing it it'll look fine, but you go back to look at it later and it's really obvious you screwed it up badly.<br><br>Then again it may be just fine.  I just noticed that the colors I'm seeing here are not the same as what I'm seeing in photoshop exactly.  They're more saturated.
