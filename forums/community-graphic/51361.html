Early last year, bored, I had a pop at something similar but considered the results too flawed to mention as, even though it was simple to implement, there was an obvious glitch.<br><br>Anyhow, I was merrily playing Resident Evil 4 last night when I had to do a double-take on some of the rendered water... same glitch! Only here, with a few extra layers of effects and shadery stuff, and cloaked in killer artwork, you could barely notice it. So I dug out my old code, cobbled together some *slightly* better art (than the original red box in the blue inverted box) and found myself a bit more pleased with how it looked.<br><br>Now if I get time, and I can find enough free, quality assets, I'll try to put together a demo that is worth looking at (no promises... busy), in the meantime here's a crappy lil' (temporary) gif that almost* shows you what I'm talking about ;P<br><br><img src="http://www.gamefreax.fsnet.co.uk/images/SledgeWater.gif"><br><br><br><br>*It's a subtle effect at 800*600, so at 160*120 you'll need good eyes (or to zoom in a bit). I already upped the params. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Also, if the waves are so flat, I'd suggest to use an animated texture instead, you'll save so much performence. The underwater mode looks kind of unspectacular, only a bit of fog, at least that's what I see on the small gif.<br><br>Now here's a suggestion: play my latest FPS Demo (CSP Engine 5) and take a bath in the water, dive underwater and you'll see both, water caustic projections on the walls as well as a sinus distortion of the screen.<br><br>Now If you could manage to sinus distort only (see code archives) the things that are over the water when you watch it from under water, that would be great. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The whole surrounding scene is reflected and distorted on the water's transparent (not that you can tell on a jpeg) surface.<br><br>I'm not letting the submerged portions of character models show through currently as I reckon the reflections look nice enough on their own. But unlike the terrain reflections these cost BIG TIME at the moment - I couldn't find a cheap way to clip them (where they meet the model) that looked satisfactory but I should hopefully be able to speed things up at least a *bit*.<br><br>Again, I'm not getting much time for this at the moment but a demo is on my mind. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
