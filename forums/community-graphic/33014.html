I've offered textures of grass, stone, wood, those sorts of things, tileable, useable in many sorts of games, and never had a single person express interest.<br><br>I can't even sell the stuff on Turbosquid.  I put three texture CD's up a couple weeks ago on TurboSquid and I've had like 95 previews total of one, and less than 40 of the others.  People aren't even BROWSING.<br><br>I was hoping collections would sell better on Turbosquid than individual textures, but it appears that is not the case.  And I sell very few single textures on TurboSquid.  I've had around 100 textures on there for over three years and most haven't sold at all and my best selling texture has only sold like 14 copies.<br><br>I don't really understand it.  I guess the web and digital cameras killed the market for textures.  Back in 1994 I would have killed to get some decent textures to make my 3D artwork.  Now you can find tons of free textures online and make lots yourself easily if you have a digital camera.<br><br>Models on the other hand... If they're models of guns and people you might sell some.  Especailly people.  And especially if they're boned.  But you'll have to allow distribution of them with games.  You also might be able to sell low poly trees, if they are good looking and detailed and you provide a lot of variety.<br><br>Some folks here said they'd by a sci-fi texture collection, but when I showed them one on Turbosquid that I thought had pretty decent looking textures, they weren't interested.  So it'd be kind of a crap shoot making textures for folks as to whether they'd buy them or not.  I guess beggars CAN be choosers. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
