It's for a game I'm creating about the life of my very interesting friend Reggie.    I know the skin is grey and the lips look like hes got lipstick on (even though that wouldn't be far out of character for Reggie), but those are just vertex colors in place until I skin him. <br>I need some advice on hair though.  Reggie wears all sorts of hairsyles from short to long, as well as hats, masks, makeup and such, and also facial hair.  I'm not quite sure about how to approach the modelling aspect of it.  I'm wondering if basic hair is a hollow or solid model or should I try to modify this existing head and do it with textures.  <br>Imagine a game very similar to the Sims 2 as far as gameplay goes.  I hope to do some facial morphing with lip sync animation for speech.<br><br><img src="http://www.doresoftware.com/panther/pics/web/head4.jpg"> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But ears have to be the size of the nose, yours look only aobut 65% of the height. Try playing with smoothing groups to make it look better (now it seems like the light is hitting it irregularly). Without skin, i doubt anyone can tell you much more than that. Dont forget eyebrows too. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You should post some more views along with wireframes so that we could give a better criticism. <br><br>Lenn hit most of the obvious parts that stand out. It looks like the nose has a crease going down it. This is probably due to the modeling seam and the adjacent edges being pulled too far down, thus not smoothing it enough. The same line runs up the chin. Around the outside of the eyes seems a bit odd. I can notice the construction there even with no wireframe, and this shouldnt really be the case.<br><br>Keep up the work! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Good call on the ear size, I adjusted it a bit, as well as the neck and chin.  I'm not sure about what to do as far as smoothing goes since I'm not using any sort of smoothing on the mesh, I'm just rendering it as is with the probably crappy OpenGL renderer in Wings.  I created some more images for you to look at; they include the reference images that I'm using.  For some reason the model looks a little different as a render than it does when I'm working on it in the modeller.  I notice this especially on the top eyelids where it seems to dip a little but inside the modeler it doesn't look like that. (look at the wireframe, which is just a screen capture)<br>Here's a front and side view with references:<br><img src="http://www.doresoftware.com/panther/pics/web/fspref.jpg"><br><br>Here's a front view wireframe:<br><img src="http://www.doresoftware.com/panther/pics/web/wire-front.jpg"><br><br>and here's a link to the Wings3D file if you want to look at it in there:<br><br><a href="http://www.doresoftware.com/panther/pics/web/reggiehead.wings" target="_blank">http://www.doresoftware.com/panther/pics/web/reggiehead.wings</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You've correctly modelled the polygons so they follow the muscle direction of the face. This will come into its element when you start to animate the face.<br>For the purpose of demoing the model I`d recommend, at this stage, to remove the lip colours and also the texture on the eyes. It's far more complimentry on your model to have either all or none of it texture.<br>The only critism so far is the eye socket needs to be 'rounded' more. Look at the profile and you'll notice the eye in the photo is set back further that the one on the model.<br><br>Good job so far! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
