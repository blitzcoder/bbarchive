I kinda like the red roof tiles, so I think it'll stay, but I might remove the pointy things ontop of the roofs. You just got me thinking that there might just be too much pointy things on the roof (with what I have planned for the inner part as well) if the city wall entrance has them too. I'll have to think about how finish the roof if I remove the pointy things.(or whatever you might call it) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The picture above doesn't do justice to how it looks like up close. I used the black and white pattern for embossing over the colored texture. It really looks like its embossed when you look at it straight on closer to the wall (if you can ignore the pixilation). However, if you look at it from the side.. thats a different story. :-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But like I said, I had my reasons for choosing those colors in this particular model. For starters, it is not a Human structure. I needed the structure to stick out of the background "like a sore thumb" (in a manner of speaking). I wanted alot of bluish tint to it, and needed some contrasting color to bring the whole thing out. Actually, initially, I wanted to make the texture animate alittle, but decided that it might be too CPU and GPU intensive for something that huge. I needed the colors to go well with some bluish (or purplish) tinted fog (and blue lighting as well), over a lush green background of a forest like setting. The setting will consist mostly of cool colors, thus I needed some warm colors to catch the eye. Also, so far I haven't made any changes, I am taking in the feedback to look at what needs improving mostly. Its also for input into future model designs. I guess maybe I should have explained a little what the model was for in the beginning. But suffice to say it is suppose to be an "alien" structure with heavy references to earthian architechural style.<br><br><br><br>Not that I am brushing all the comments off coz I know it sounds like it. Isn't critique all about feedback, then you listen to the feedback to decide if changes should be made ? <br><br>Like I mentioned before, the materials (with the exception of the roof) was intended to be stone in that color (like marble), tough stone that withstands the weather and time coz its "magical" (this was where I thought having the texture move would be nice). Neither algae or moss will grow on it, unlike the roof (yes, there is moss growing on that roof in the "cracks"). At this stage, I am removing the yellow pointy thing on the roof. Then ponder if I should just leave it as that before I finish the whole model. <br><br>In order to finish the model; I need to attach the other side of the wall and reflect the other half of the model. (2 entrances to the city gates.) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
