Might benefit you as a learning experience to have made it, but selling maps and such just doesn't work, especially when one such as this could easily be recreated since it's very, very basic.  Even at $10, this is not likely to be worth it to anyone.  The beginners probably won't want to pay $10 for something so simple and the people who can already do it simply won't want it because you can't really just buy a map for a game.<br><br>This is somewhat a problem using with Maplet, since it's very weak as a level editor- at most you would use it to create a rough layout (what this appears to be)- but also the problem is that you don't seem to yet know how to really make levels.  Not saying I can yet make them on a professional level, but this is very much right-at-the-beginning work.<br><br>My advice would be to look up tutorials on mapping.  Old Quake 3 ones are still good to learn from, there are plenty for Half-life 1 and 2 now that would be able to show you various processes and techniques for it as well.  I don't know where any of these are off the top of my head, but it shouldn't be terribly hard to find them. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's only real issues at this point is a lack of a (working) undo system and support for anything that requires shaders.  Otherwise, it's fast and easy to use, and has support for prefab pieces.  It's also not that costly... although perhaps Josh can comment on when version 6 will arrive.<br><br>On the topic of csg level design... if you're adding pillars to a level (and with respect to not knowing how Maplet works), try not to have them cut into the floor, creating unneeded geometry.

I've been meaning to have a look at 3D World Studio.

It made for some interesting geometry fragmentation issues, as well as being less versatile.<br><br>---<br><br>Regarding level editors, one of my pet peeves with most level and world editors is that they usually don't provide a flythrough mode along the lines of what I use for the model flythrough listed on this page. It's easy enough to toggle between GUI and flythrough modes with a keypress, and it just makes it so much easier to get into a proper position for viewing and working on a model or level. Most model editors could also probably benefit from a flythrough mode - although they tend to be used to work on more compact geometry, so it's less of an issue.

It's actually one of the reasons I like using it, because it's so much smoother than everything else I tried.  When you right click you exit that mode, and can work on whatever you like in the main 3d view.  Holding shift will speed up your movement... which is great for large levels. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
