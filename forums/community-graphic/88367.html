After they have been processed, the second ball is moved and checked too. And this happens every frame.)<br><br>Then the collision with the first ball deleted the block entity and the type-instance and the second ball cannot find the block anymore, because it's already destroyed.<br>This would give MAV's.<br><br>I would like to ask you to try the game and report if it runs fine or not.<br>I'm also willing to listen to any suggestions for improvements.<br><br>This is my very first game written in Blitz3D (in fact, it's my very first game ever).<br>I've programmed some other programs in Visual Basic 6, but never anything like this.<br><br>The level-editor is included too, so you can create your own levels if you like (up to 125 levels are supported).<br>Also the full source-code of both the game and the editor is included and may be used freely without any restrictions.<br>This is just a test-project to expand my programming skills.<br><br>The sounds come from Windows Vista, as I don't have a sound-editing program. I just searched around and found some sounds that could be used for this game.<br><br>Also my 3D GUI System is included (in the folder of the leveleditor source-code), as the editor uses it.<br>It's simple, but very stable.<br><br><a href="http://users.telenet.be/vge/Arkanoid3D/Arkanoid3D.zip" target="_blank">http://users.telenet.be/vge/Arkanoid3D/Arkanoid3D.zip</a><br>Keep the directory structure intact while unzipping or the game/editor cannot find the resources they need and you'll get MAV's. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
