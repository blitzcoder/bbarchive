Sometimes it works, and sometimes the screen glitches, flickers, shows lines, the display wraps itself vertically, and it will freeze at random moments.  This is after I already re-installed everything, updated gfx drivers, down-dated gfx drivers, and the whole bit, so I'm thinking when the replaced the screen (toshiba the makers no less) screwed it up.  Also, the dvd drive they replaced is something called a panasonic UJ-820s I think, and the panasonic website doesn't even acknowledge it's existence. And there are absolutely no drivers for it, whatsoever. And also, here's the kicker, it won't recognize the drive from boot, so I can't boot from cd or dvd, can't reformat etc, etc. I'm going back home soon, and when I do I'm going to walk into best buy and beat the stuffing out of those geek squad kids with my 9.9lb. toshiba.
