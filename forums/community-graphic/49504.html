This is basically what you've done with the metallic skin, which is why I prefer it.<br><br>I'd also ditch the font you're using on the buttons as it's not easy to read.

They draw your eyes away from the questions.<br><br>In all the deisgns, the horizontal lines across the middle created by the sharp transition from black mess with your eyes.  I would try to fix that by adding a darker indentation around the black area to reduce the contrast, or making the black area have a color instead.<br><br>I would consider making the yellow buttons int he first image the same green as the lower bar.  I might try making them a slighly darker shade though to indicate they are a seperate part opf the interface and to make them appear to be in the background more as if they are less important than the other interface elements, which they are if you are in the middle of playing a game. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The layout doesn't present the question and answers in a clear way.<br><br>The button shapes are inconsistent, making it look more accidental than intentional. They are also placed at weird locations, both on screen (not centered) and relative to each other. Try to keep straight lines, and avoid having uneven edges. Additionally it is not a good idea to place unrelated buttons side by side (ie. answer buttons and option buttons).<br><br>The primary purpose of the interface should be to present the question and answers, in as clear a way as possible. Whether it should be metal or plastic is irrelevant, and purely a question of taste.<br><br>While you are probably reluctant, my advice is start over, with the clear goal in mind that it should present the question and answers as clearly as possible. Do not get distracted with bevel/emboss and drop shadows, but simply make the important parts stand out.<br><br>For an example of a Q&amp;A game that works, have a look at You Don't Know Jack.

Try it out, and ask yourself which one you would rather buy (assuming yours will be comercial).<br><br>I have more comments, but don't want to sound like a sour grape, so I'll stop here...

I think it ought to fit the theme.  The questions here don't seem to be aimed at kids, but the plasticy interface looks more like it is geared towards kids.  <br><br>The first interface would be salvageable for an adult game if you used fewer colors.  <br><br>I like the red background and the purple.  The red window too.  The green lower interface maybe could stay, but the yellow buttons and stuff needs to be a different color.  The yellow circles should be the same color as those at the top.  The buttons... the same color as the bottom.  The bottom maybe a darker purple. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
