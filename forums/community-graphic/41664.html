Basicly it's all about a DVD I just bought that includes 8 gigs of sounds, loops etc. A very nice thing. Tho a lot of you guys won't like this kind of music:<br><br><a href="http://www.melog.ch/songs/dropdabeat.mp3" target="_blank">http://www.melog.ch/songs/dropdabeat.mp3</a><br><br>In fact it's not the type of Music I usually create. But I couldn't resist. At least I am now capable of creating music from trance to metal for my games quickly without to waste hours for searching for loops in the web. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

At first, I was thinking about nitpicks like the tempo seeming a little fast for the saxophone's slow approach.  But as it went on, I started reading emails and such (since it's six minutes long) and sort of stopped listening to it consciously.<br><br>A little while later, I found myself just grooving along with it, then remembered that it was something that I was supposed to be "testing," not just "enjoying."  Well, forget about that - I actually did enjoy it!  Critically, I have to say that it's not the best smooth jazz that I've ever heard, but it certainly *did* pass the test of being good enough to really listen to and enjoy as real music (and not just as a collection of loops).  So, well done!<br><br>What software/DVD is that, BTW? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

With some knowledge of conventional composition you'll be able to use them in a unique way nevertheless (eg. mix the styles, and move the samples to be played at offbeat positions etc.) Byside that it lets you compose good stuff in no time that can be used in your projects.<br>Here I used MUSIX music maker and MUSIX soundpool DVD 2005. The App has some pros and some cons, tho the soundpool content is really useful. The music maker is a drag'n'drop editor that lets you positon samples on a horizontal snap-grid sequencer canvas. It has some nice features like time-stretch and pitch-transpose, fade-in and -out envelopes per sample etc. It's a simple tool for people who don't want to learn a lot first. Then again it may be limited in a lot of aspects. I also had a few (app) crashes with it.<br><br>Normally I use the ModPlug Tracker that is freeware. It is a real Tracker, following the orignal Tracker philosophy as seen the first time with the noise tracker on the amiga, if I remember right (4 tracks once upon a time :) ). This Tracker gives total freedom, but also offers less comfort, eg. there is no drag and drop placement. It's also harder to learn. Pro: freeware.<br><br>Some people here use "Fruity Loops", seems to be something like MAGIX, as far as I hear it's pretty good and simple too. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
