I mentioned a few things back in a previous discussion with WERDNA.<br><br>If he needs a logo today, for serious business, he should hire someone (as I think he already has done) to make one. Logo artists are a special breed, and just a lot better at making superb ones than your average artist who isn't focused on them. That's not to say a good artist can't make a decent logo, but if you want the best, you hire a specialist. So, the three options are-<br><br>- Keep your logo <i>really</i> simple, and get an artist's opinion before rolling ahead with it. A logo can be as simple as plain text with a well-chosen font (I saw a multi-million dollar company in Japan with one like that recently- plain blue, nothing special). Make sure it's applied properly, and in the right format. If you don't know how to do basic anti-aliasing (hint hint WERDNA) learn how to do the basics.<br><br>- Hire a recommended artist. By that I mean, leave programmer world and ask a professional game/print expert if the quality of the artist's work is as good as they say. Alternatively, look at popular modern design examples on sites like Smashingmagazine.com Your logo may not blow people away, but at least it'll look decent and not hurt the rest of what you're attaching it to. There's an obvious cost involved, but it shouldn't break the bank.<br><br>- Hire a pro logo designer. That'll be the tricky one to find. They can be found on google (search for logo design), although most of those guys will design a logo without your website as reference. The best method is just to keep your eyes and ears open for top-level artists (look on graphic websites and ask around) who are reliable and willing to work with you. The cost might be high. But, you can start now by taking note of the experts when they appear. Send them an email and ask about pricing. When you need them, you have their contact.<br><br><div class="quote"> ...that doesn't exactly help him out *now* (or in the next 'ten+ years'), does it? <br></div><br><br>In a way it does (or it should!). It's saying, "Hey, slow down. Give it time. It's not a matter of adding A, then B and then C to your to-do list software, and then ticking them off after your first go.<br><br>The basic way to think about this is- great artists are great because of much practice, study, etc. It's not an overnight thing. If you need to go from zero to hero in a hurry, you hire someone. I recently needed a voice actor for a video. So, I had a shot at recording my voice. I sounded like an idiot, so I hired someone. All I can say is, I'm glad I kept my eyes open for a top-shelf professional.<br><br>I hope that helps. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

A logo can be as simple as plain text with a well-chosen font (I saw a multi-million dollar company in Japan with one like that recently- plain blue, nothing special). Make sure it's applied properly, and in the right format. If you don't know how to do basic anti-aliasing (hint hint WERDNA) learn how to do the basics. <br></div><br><br>I see no reason why this method won't suffice for your purposes.  It will be clean, crisp, simple and professional.  Many major companies do this, like take Lenovo for example:<br><br><img src="http://fcubed.com/technology/img/lenovo_logo.jpg"><br><br>Seeing as you are just starting off, begin with a logo like this.  As your website/business progresses, you may need to evolve your logo.  But worry about that when the time comes; making the games should be the greater focus. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
