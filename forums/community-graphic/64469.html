Consider replacing it with something more concise and decisive. Perhaps "Bonebroke Games is dedicated to developing high quality, highly playable, unique independent games."<br><br><div class="quote"> But most of all, a game with soul. <br></div><br>What exactly does this mean? It sounds a bit weak and naive to me, and it hardly gels with your "0% bullshit" tagline.<br><br><div class="quote"> Nano is the debut game of Bonebroke Games. It's been in on-off development for a several years now, and the idea of the game has expanded quite a bit. Now I have finally decided to finish this thing, so the fulltime development will start 1.12.2006 and continue as long as my savings last or my girlfriend kicks me out. <br></div><br>This is humourous, but it also makes you sound indecisive and uncommitted. Your final sentence in this paragraph says that development will continue as long as your girlfriend kicks you out - did you mean that it will continue as long as she <i>doesn't</i> kick you out? If so, then you should modify the last part to ".. and my girlfriend doesn't kick me out."<br><br>Clearly you are trying to inject some personality and humour into your website, but, in my opinion, as it stands, it portrays you as weak willed, idealistic and uncommitted, which I am certain is not really the case. In other words, it's bad publicity.<br><br>Regarding the general look of the website - it seems somewhat grey and grainy to me. Consider making it brighter and cleaner. Whilst a nice idea, the boney fingers seem a bit sketchy to me, and the background grain behind the finger images is ever so slightly - but noticably - different to the background grain behind the rest of the website, resulting in a clear box surrounding the finger images.<br><br>I hope this is useful to you. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
