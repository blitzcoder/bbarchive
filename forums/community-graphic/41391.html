It'll benefit you, I think.<br><br>I have handled anim8or also (man what I have not handled, lol... ;) )<br><br>first...about animation, but u can't export animation other than isolated frames that u can convert later on as full piece keyframes into md2 or md3 (with npherno compiler and other tools...) , so u can load in blitz.<br><br>oh, milkshape...no weights, that is only 100% or 0% weight...but extra bones can tweak it , doing accomodation, specially as this is low , low poly...and there u have b3dexport. Yep, I suppose that's what u do.<br><br>anyway, anin 0.9 beta2 you have weights per vertex I think.<br>(for the , for exaple, md2 route. Can't remeber now if importing simple 3ds files in quake modeller, and compiling to md2, and do the uv mapping and texturing in NTS mapper,would do the job...maybe yes.Seems, md2 is a way to go with rts games in blitz, anyway.)<br><br>oops, smooth groups...forgetting..<br><br>well, u just double click in the object, and in properties that appear, u have "smooth angle" .Usually a value of 60, 75, 80 will do the deal. For sharpy objects, maybe 45.<br><br>Anywaysm the smooth info is killed a bit once compiled the md2: that is...you need later on to plane VERY well the uv mapping...md2 and md3 CAN't deal a vertex with two UV coords, and that happens in every uv vertex in the contour of an uv mapping area (ie, the face) .So, what it does, is it break there the mesh, duplicating the vertices there.<br>The result is like an unwanted smooth groups sharp edge. A cut in smoothing. Like if u had an edge in the middle of the face or something. <br><br>Only deal for this, is hid well the uv borders.How you do this? In lithunwrap, or whatever you use (NTS mapper is quite good, too, just people don't know such an ancient tool) you make theuv island (chunk) so that the selection you make for , for example , the human face, have its limits in somewhere:<br><br>-a) not seen. (like below the head, just in the union neck-head)<br>-b ) coincident witha real border: ie, where the hair starts and joins the face ;)<br>-c ) wehre due to nature of texture would be less noticed, like in back of head.<br><br>or all together ;)<br><br><br>Anyway, if u can rebuild normals inside of blitz, but FOR AN MD2, then, don't mess with it...only that Anim8or's normals will (smooth angle) will let you expect WAY better how it's gonna be seen once smooth.It's essential in games. U model an dedit depending totally on that.<br><br>Anyway, for an md2, is yet important this what i tell you of hiding UV borders, as I expect any engine will output the problem, as is a format limit.<br><br>md3 also. (anyway, for rts, md3 is surely much more slower.seems md2 is the perfect for your game)<br><br>Also, *.3ds files DO have this problem too. So, if conversions are to be done in 3ds, take in consideration mor elikely the smoothing info will have anyway those cuts...That is, probably it will unweld already in export.U can fix for example in Milkshape with menu Vertex/"weld together". I suppose Milkshape has md2 export. If so, u could tweak it there, as though not having goood weights, u can bone animate, and probably tweak the vertices, and then export the animation: I think if I remeber well in a mod I was the guys used to tweak vertices once bone animated, as the UT format *.3d (yep, without the s) is vertes animation, like md2. Surely allows this, avoiding the non weights weirdiness of milkshape. <br><br>Perhaps that one is ur easier (by far!) route. If possible what I am telling in milkshape. And if u prefer to model in anim8or, just export the model in whatever the format, (OBJ is WAY better, and the milkshape importer is very good) , uv map the obj in lithunwrap 1.3 (is quite better than Milkshape uv mapping)  , export again as OBJ , import the obj into Milkshape. You can do there the vertex weld if see some cuts. I use to do even(in whatever the package) if I don't see them, for security.(milkshape does it only with coincident vertices, REALLY good feature...as then joins only the duplicated in 3ds or md2 export)<br><br>You can add smooth groups in Milskhape. In Anim8or (haven't digged much the latest beta2 of 0.9, and downloading now -out of curiosity- the beta 3) the smooth angle is just autosmooth value: It just puts the hard edges for you there where an angle is more narrow than the value you did set: very angled faces will have the crease. So when u u want face smooth, don't make sharp angles. <br><br>The other way gives much more control.In Wings3d is hard edges.But OBJ wings exporter seems not to export well those.But luckily you have some for of this in Milkshape. You make smooth groups: groups of faces that are continuous and smooth.It only puts a sharp edge in the contours of the selection you make :)<br><br>Is now being discused to add this feature to Blender.<br><br>So, your path Anim8or-lith-milkshape (I'm 99% sure it exports nice md2) should find not a single problem :)<br><br>PS: models are very good fo rthat count :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

IE one allways that is possible, and two when no other thing can be done. There will be moments u'll need 3, though.<br><br>BTW, there's a trick to attach weapons with md2. Old trick...You make to objects, weapon and character...in your milkshape or Max, or cfx, or blender, whatever, you link the  weapon as normally, to hand. Also apply a diferent texture per each object (one for character, one for weapon) . When you're ready to export the whole set of animations (usually one anim with walk, iddle, attack, etc, in a whole single sequence (writting down the frames number wher each action starts/ends)) you export them separatedly: you keep the "master" max, blender of ms3d, etc, file intact, while work on a copy (an advice). You load this file, and...delete the weapon. then export the whole animation but so, withouth the weapon. Calling it for example, buddy.md2 (in quake2 they allways called it "tris.md2", hehe) .Now, load again the master file (or a copy of it) , and delete the character leaving only the weapon animation (beware: some packages will change weapon loaction if it were child of character...In CFX u can delete the object safely, as skeleton remains, and so, positions do not changes, and skeleton gets not exported in md2, only vertices.) , and export it as md2, calling it, for example weapon.md2.<br><br>At loading time in your code, you load both animations in place...if u leave intact the global coords of it, or change same in both, the weapon will keep allways relative to character, just as u designed and animated it.As u saw in your package.<br><br>"vertex alpha, or entity fx, and blends"<br><br>No, can't do in an md2, though you can fake things, and I wouldn't loose the advantages of it in an rts or many-characters in screen rol game, just for some effects...Good modelling and good texture imho, is all you really need...The models are quite good for the count; maybe the textures need more work and a bit more contrast or definition, ...and detail...dunno... feel free to not use too small textures...256x256 would be great, probably.Depends on how may characters, also... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Two, as md2 can't have more than one skin (skin is texture in this case, there's confussion if refering to the weights info) , so, u were forced to do all in a single mesh, welded, and also save texture space in the already -usually- tiny md2 texture of 256x256...<br><br>As u'r actually outputing (doing as I mentioned in previous post) one md2 for weapon, and amnother md2 file for character, each has its own texture. I made in a kind of joke an md2 dwarf. The character texture was 256x256, while weapong didn't worth to use a texture of more than 64x64, as was very simple/small(size of weapon model will make it be less/more seen) weapon.<br><br>Character Fx is quite a good tool for this: better than Milkshape, as Milkshape don't have weights. With weightsin ur package u actually bake that anim smoothness in joints. You wont be able to do that in ms3d even if use b3d format. You'd be able to do so if export as b3d or md2 in Cfx. But as mentioned, md2 will be much better for performance for your type of game. Blender rocks for md2 too, but u really need to know it quite deeply.<br><br>md2 only pair of things to be really aware of are...that it looks ok for a warcraft3 or whatever "from a distance view", but you see some vertex trembling if aproach the camera for a very near shot...(not in these games(NWN style, etc))<br><br>Second, and probably more important, is that like md3, it can't have duplicated Uvs per vertex. It actually then breaks smoothing there(as breaks mesh duplicating vertices and leaving em unwelded), generating an unwanted seem in an smooth surface (worst case: in the middle of the face) .Only workaround for this that I know is...hide the seams while uv mapping. Make ur uv islands so that the uvs get put in places like bellow the chin, in the interior side of arms, in interior of legs...not that bad when u plan it when start uv mapping. this issue does not happens with x or b3d format, but yes with md3, md2, 3ds.<br><br>There's a third advantage for doing my mentioned weapon trick...u can load animations without the weapon, like walk, etc.<br><br>Anyway, you'll use with all sure b3d, reading your last posts. But thought I'd give u more info. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Not very effective especially if there are hundreds of weapons and armour possibilities.  It just seems like a cludge to do it teh way you described,  since you may have several characters that are animated differntly, and if you have 100 items.  then you must animate each item for every character.. so if you have 20 characters thats 2000 animations for the items.  <br><br>when using B3D boned format, you can just attach the item and it move with the animation automatically so its also much less work in setting it up. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
