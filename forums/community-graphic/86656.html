Unfortunatly real time shadows are too large a hit on the framerate for me to justify them, and open up a can of worms for other lighting requirements such as direct x lights would have to cast shadows as well..  too much to worry about for a little gain.<br><br>The gig part of this post is that I want my main tank retextured with bump,dif,and specular maps (indie pro quality standard) and / or remodelled as well.  Email GameMaker04@... to give a quote for this job. Two quotes pls, one for the texture work, and one for texture and remodelling.<br><br>heres the current look<br><img src="http://www.empowergames.com/bumped2.jpg"><br><br>and heres a shot of the tank model broken up to show its groupings, as well as an image of a vehicle i found on the net that has the texturing "look" i want for my tank.<br><br><img src="http://www.empowergames.com/remodeltank.jpg"> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If I could embrace the "toon" style 100% i would be very happy but nomatter what I do in that department it still looks like bland dx7 imo, so im just opening more options to suit varied player opinions.<br><br><div class="quote"> With more "realistic" look, it won't be fun anymore, it will just become interesting, but not fun at all... as many game that involve recent assets with shaders and many more "gadget features" that just show a stuff, but not a gameplay. <br></div><br><br>I get that statement, but im not sure how that applies here.  I havent modified the gameplay, just added a visual style. I dont think the style is "more realistic" it just has bump maps, and bullet trail lights.  Theres no real time shadows, or shaders at all.  The new textures were purchased from the Total Textures CD v.15 "toon pack" wich came with bumpmaps, I didnt pull anything from a "realistic" photo asset package. They are all hand drawn toony textures, as far as harmonising things? ive posted more shots below, i dont think ive dropped out of sync yet, but<br>Again though, you dont have to turn on the "bumpy render" and can play it vanilla still.<br><br>I personally like this shot ( <a href="http://www.empowergames.com/tinytanksshot.jpg?" target="_blank">http://www.empowergames.com/tinytanksshot.jpg?</a> ) better than the above, but having the option to move the game from one style to another is a good feature I think. I was prompted to add this as well, by one of the few publishers who have taken a closer look at it recently.  As an option I think is the best way to do so.<br><br><br>The shots above are intentionally set to a dark "night time" setting with low ambient light, dark close fog, and dim moonlight to test the bullet glow lighting.  Here are a couple last min shots i took with the some brighter ambience.  They are still pretty toony, and again it can be toggled.  When you run it "normal mode" no bump maps or specular maps are loaded so the memory requirements are still as low as ever<br><br><br><br>NO BUMPING<br><img src="http://www.empowergames.com/stilltoony3.jpg"><br><br>WITH BUMPING.. minimal change in the overal style i think , dont you ??<br><img src="http://www.empowergames.com/stilltoony.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.empowergames.com/stilltoony2.jpg"><br><br><br><br><br>Ok, sorry to post so many shots, I wanted to show you the proper lighting,  do you still think the bumping is changing the overall themed style of the game?  I personally dont see it, but ill admit I find art and the application of themed styles very challenging. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
