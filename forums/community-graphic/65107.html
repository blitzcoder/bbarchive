Nearly every topic I make gets deleted. I made 2 seperate topics, each containing an image that I wanted feedback on. Because the images were from the same "project" and each in their own topic, somone decided to delete the threads ?<br><br>Wtf ?? I just get less and less inclined to post on this forum nowadays!<br><br>Now the rant is over...<br><br><br>I am applying for a 2D-pixel artist job and they required me to draw some test pieces before the interview stage.<br><br>The brief was:<br><br><b> To help us assess a potential Artist’s abilities we have devised a simple test that ALL candidates must complete before being considered for a role of Artist. <br><br>As well as strong drawing and visualizing skills we are also looking for candidates who can “think out of the box” so read the brief carefully  and think about how best you are going to impress.<br><br>This test is divided in two parts. The emphasis should be put on both details and good use of a restricted colour palette. The sprite animation tests should reflect good timing and the respect of the guideline for producing sprites. <br>You should produce two version of the brief; one realistic and a second that is more cartoon based (e.g. Manga, Warner Bros, and Disney etc.). <br> <br>Background test:<br>Paint a 128*128 pixels size background using 16 colours. The background should represent a common street from a big city (e.g. New York) in daylight. The background must wrap horizontally and be represented in a realistic way. Repeat the exercise with you’re chosen second cartoon style.<br> <br>Sprite test:<br>Produce 2, 4/5 frames walk animation of a character of your choice (one realistic and one in your chosen cartoon style). Sprite size is 32*48 pixels, maximum.</b><br><br><br>Here are my 4 pieces.<br><br>"realistic city"<br><img src="http://skn3.acsv.net/images/portfolio_city_realistic.png"><br><br>"cartoon city"<br><img src="http://skn3.acsv.net/images/portfolio_city_cartoon.png"><br><br>"realistic sprite"<br><img src="http://skn3.acsv.net/images/portfolio_spirte_realistic.gif"><br><br>"cartoon sprite"<br><img src="http://skn3.acsv.net/images/portfolio_spirte_cartoon.gif"><br><br><br>I got some feedback from the previous thread (before they were deleted) and made some changes based on that. Thanks.<br><br>So whaddya think ? Any comments ? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
