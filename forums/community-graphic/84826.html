Noel's (Nillums) is perfect for demonstrating that. Very simple shapes, and even simplier colour scheme.<br><br>Compared to yours, which has a circular gradient that fades. That creates too many different colours and patterns. Then you have a textured rock area, full of very small different coloured areas.

The simplicity helps for them to be easily remembered and recognised as well as preventing confusion with others' similar logos.<br>Examples:<br>Micorsoft, Apple, McDonald's, The Red Cross, Hewlett Packard, Atari, LucasArts<br><br>2) STICK WITH ONE STYLE<br>Mixing 2D and 3D images/text serves only to make the whole thing appear like a collage, rather than a singular unit. Also take into account thee typeface and  Image and the general concept. For example, gothic script suggests antiquity and traditionalism, a standard font such as Tiems or Bookman indicates professionalism but rather plain and bureaucratic, whereas something sans-serif and rounded enforces modernisation, futurism and even revolutionary.<br>Also, consider the appearance of the image(s) you use with respect to this.<br><br>3) PRIMARY COLOURS<br>Make good use of primary colours, they are clear, distinct, bright and colourful and will catch the eye.<br><br>4) TAGLINE<br>Keep the Tagline short, snappy, and informative. This should be poignant and give a concise summary of what you (can) offer.<br><br><img src="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/mickyandlaura/BB/lhg.jpg"> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There are a few interesting lessons that you can learn from it and use to improve your own logo.<br><br>1. Do you see how clean and crisp his lines are? Nothing is fuzzy or indistinct. As a result, the logo is very easy on the eye.<br><br>2. Notice how he uses "simple" detailing to create the illusion of depth, texture and substance. Take a close look at his lighthouse: do you see how those five stripes of white (a) make the structure appear not only solid but also cylindrical and (b) help to evoke the "feel" of a lighthouse without the use of surplus, muddying details? Nilium strikes a fine balance between simplicity and detail, adding just enough to the scene to get the point across without complicating things. What do you need to include in your logo to get the point across? A lighthouse? The sea? The lighthouse beam? What can you do without? Palm trees? Seagulls? Clouds? Boats (I personally like a little boat)?<br><br>3. Pay attention to the composition. Where is our eye drawn. When I look at the logo, my eye is led from the rocks to the cliff face, then to the lighthouse, and finally out to sea, following the beam of light. It's amazing how clever composition can make even the simplest of logos interesting <br><br>My logo attempt is inferior to Nilium's for a number of reasons, and it is also stylistically/aesthetically different, but there are a few fundamental rules that we have both used (in my case, quite badly!) to compose our examples. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

They're basic design principles which apply as much to basic layout as they do to font choice.  On top of carp, (or crap, depending on who it is you're talking to!) there are things to take into consideration, such as working in vector, and taking care of anti-aliasing and compression.  Those are all things most beginners don't handle all too well, which makes it easy to pick a newbie's logo or design a mile away.  In your case, one of the main issues is colour choice.  It's not hard to tell you haven't experimented with (or studied) much more than primary/safe colour pallettes.  On the other hand, JustLuke seems to have a strong understanding of what works with what, in context.<br><br>Anyway, the point is- there's a lot to learn about this stuff.  Asking people on a forum about whether design a, b or c is best isn't going to make up for a pure lack of understanding.  Some people will say, "I can't design at all, but try this!" and present a horrible example of what to do, and others will say, "Yes, not bad." and then try and walk you through all 50 thousand design principles as you make revisions.<br><br>Each way is kind, but there is a better way to do things.  If you want a logo now, ask JustLuke or Nilium to make one for you (at a special price, or something) and start learning how to improve your art skills (properly) and train your eye towards excellence.  It'll take time, but if you're looking to make games and create the art for them as well, it's the only way to go.  Selling games isn't about meeting your own standards- it's about meeting those of your target market.  And, if you're targeting more than 2 year olds, you'll need to raise the bar. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Also, the disparate angle of the text can be a little off-putting. (The "Lighthouse Games" text isn't even centred within the 'cone' of the light)<br>A darker outline around the lettering would improve them considerably.<br><br>With the waves, they are too 'hand-drawn' in appearance.
