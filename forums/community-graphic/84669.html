Jeez.  I guess you failed to notice the smiley face.<br><br><br><div class="quote"> Now how about you improve it instead of stopping at that? <br></div><br><br>How about you listen to what I've been telling people over and over again?<br><br><br>A publisher who is interested in publishing the game asked me for some high res assets from the game so that their in house artist could use them to put together a mockup cover. This mockup cover would be used to shop the game around to places like Target and Best Buy. I threw together my own quick mockup using the same graphics to give their artist some ideas, to help ensure the cover would be exciting and convey the look of the game well.  <br><br><br>I don't care if the planet isn't properly anti-alaised, because this isn't going to be used for ANYTHING other than to give the publisher's artist some ideas for layout and how to make the art look a little snazzier with some effects like glow and motion blur. And I don't care if the aliens aren't detailed enough or you think they don't mesh well with the planets because the art you see here is actual art from the game (which I paid $1500 for) and the artist that did it has long since gone off to work for some company in Europe, and my budget is completly blown. In fact, I will be lucky if I can make my rent payment this month, nevermind hiring another artist to redo everything, which is what you're asking me to do.<br><br>Allow me to be perfectly clear:  Even if I WANTED to, there is NO CHANCE IN HELL of any of the art being redone at this point. And it follows that there's no point in complaining about it if there's no chance of any changes being made.<br><br><br>Finally, even if I DID have the means to have the art redone, I wouldn't change a thing, because I LIKE IT THE WAY IT IS.  I specifically told the artist to design the art in this manner. I wanted something fun, and colorful, and retro.  AND something which wouldn't cost me a fortune.  And that's what I got.  I also wanted something functional.  And that lack of detail in the aliens you're complaining about was in fact, a design decision.<br><br>The reason the enemies have so little detail is not only because they're supposed to look funny, and retro, or because they were cheap to build and animate, but also because this game is geared towards casual gamers... and casual gamers have crappy video cards and will run the game at low resolutions.  At 800x600, each of these aliens it only 40 pixels tall.  And when you take an alien which is 40 pixels tall, and you make it fly quickly around the screen, while animating, all that extra detail you want, would be lost, or worse, would make the aliens look all muddy and blurry and crappy.  The aliens above are between 3-5x the size they would appear in the game. They've been blown up to this size because the publisher needed high res box art, and this is ALL I've got.  <br><br>And they look less detailed than the planet here, because in the game, the planets, unlike the aliens, take up half the screen.  But I had to adjust the relative scales of the two for the purpouses of composing a more interesting image.<br><br><br>In short: <br><br>I can't afford to make any changes.  This is the art I've got available.  The publisher is the only one who's ever going to see this besides you guys.  So not only would it be pointless to make any changes to this, but you're just pissing into the wind by complaining about it, as nothing can be done at this point.<br><br>I'm not being hard-headed.  I'm simply being REALISTIC. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
