Indeed, ur very good at that.<br><br>And at Polycount, in pimping forums, it's rather usual to spot every single small detail. They get a lot of improvement this way. The bad thing is...It also doe snot encourage some people, when cirtics are too hard. At Zbrushcentral, moderators sugested a clever way, that i used as a drawing (cough, substitute) teacher, 1,2,1 I think or however was called. You spot an error, said two good things. When you say only bad details, some people tend to think they did it all bad. Which neither is true, and ecrtainly is as helpful to strenght what they've already done well, so they catch a possible good path. Not that I could give these type of comment to Noel or Ruz. They could do that with me, anyway ;)<br><br>To a coder that hasn't seen that hundred of posts, it sounds harsh. But imho, here, and at Polycount, Noel is probably one of the friendest at that task ;)<br><br>And I'm liking that wc3 style cottage modelling.<br><br>[ I think u're learning now to model, or that at least you started later than texturing, isn't it? ]<br><br>Bout the head (bob3d = off topic) , I'd say...perhaps, just perhaps, Ruz modelled it for better edgeloops that help in face expressions animations, am I right? look at how the loops flow in the almost exact (past the endings of the mouth, it may need and extra egde to aovid a peak when he smiles, but not sure) flow of the existing muscles of a human face. Look at surrounding ones aorund mouth, also bellow the eyes. Perhaps he made it only to build in a clean and accurate way the volumes, but it certainly can help a lot when facial animation with little bones and very carefull weighting (unless his engine uses vertex animation and he can do some morph targets, but I prefer the first)<br><br>Noel imho comes from that very qualified Polycount "school" , that's why surely tries to make each polygon "count". (sorry for playing with words)<br><br>But as is a hobby thing, or probably targeting a demo with a good 3d card or just an cutscene stuff in real time, I'd say  counting on facial animation, the extra polies will help.<br><br>In the ...head(where there's skin, don't your english word) there's not so much polies...nor in the neck, so perhaps he just plan to do that type of animation. <br><br><br>My only critiques would be on proportions. A head can be like that, and Leonardo (that one from the old times) would say there's so many human types (as he documented) .Is possible, and even in many faces, so , so correct, though not the typical cannon, which use to have les distance between browses and hair beguining. makes the upper half in irfan 135 pixels tall, since middle of the eye to the chin, 117. Usually middle of the eye, or browse can be middle really, though not exactly that...I have the measures in my head, but can't tell u now, as is a feel I have while I draw and model, but can't say an exact math proportion here and now.<br><br>jaw, cheek bones, are too wide. Is good as it makes the strong cowboys I saw in his mod ;) long ago...it depends on the character pretended, but this one has maybe to strong-wide ones. Also, as that whole are has less height than it should (or the other has too much) , that sensation is increased.<br><br>ABout the eyes, to droppy, again, those are possible, and present in som much people. Maybe if pretending a perfect typical human game hero, or main player character, would be ideal to make him handsome, but heh, is not initially incorect. it depends on the intention of the artist :)<br><br>The more realistic a human head is -and is a pretty good example- the easier for people to find tinny errors. I'm an oil portraits painter, done for money, and know very well that pain. You don't till what crazy details they come about...Even more when they have an idealized concept of their girlfriends, the poor women... XDDD<br><br>I'd apply with careful smooth selection in Max an scale down of browse and upwards, and lengthen the other half (do in two steps) , specially...well...MAINLY since nose ending to chin ending...that's the shorter area, making the chin small for that strong jaw. probably...surely indeed, make the jaw and cheek bones thinner in X axe. This with smooth selection to noyt kill the great work, very carefuly.<br><br>I'm imagining it with that, and may end with just two simple touches even mor eoutstanding.<br><br>IMHO, when I'm modelling this happens to me constantly..even more in computer as the tool makes  it more difficult, an du loose track of things when working zoomed, etc...<br><br>He maybe used bmp as that richeness of texturing that he always make, and the care put into modelling details, maybe lost or screwed with jpg compression...I'd adivice PNG , though ;)<br><br>And yep...it probably preferrable if I'd have shut my mouth, and say just wow, as is a very good model.<br>I remember posting in some forums..."not searching for c&amp;c" ,as in some forums, it's like they were waiting to destroy you, lol...XDDD<br><br>Indeed, probably he posted just to show the wip, and was going to fix a load of things, all what I said much probably. <br><br>Or he actually wants that type of human.<br><br>dunno, was in the mood to write about this one XD <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
