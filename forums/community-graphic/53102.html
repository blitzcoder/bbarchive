Please let me know what you think about. <br><br><img src="http://medievalworlds.com/th/lowpolyset5_th1xl2.jpg"><br><br>I have now uploaded the models a few moments ago, for a price of 150$ on www.the3dstudio.com.<br><br>Here a Link:<br><br>www.the3dstudio.com/product_details.aspx?id_product=10808<br><br>Because I can change prices at the3dstudio, you will find there a lot of models with a reduced price. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This means they may not merge well with the other 2 building packs.  So, I probably wouldn't use the 9 houses as houses.

Maybe it has to do with the fact that i have "some" skills in modeling/texturing so i always believe its easier to put in hard work than pay. But if you cant make it yourself, and you need to models base a game on, thats an ok price.<br><br>I'm also only prepared to pay 100+ on marketing and advertising. Thats the primary investment any game needs. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I compared one of the tall houses with one of the bungalow types and they are noticeably not in scale.<br><br>The only noticeable area for improvement is the some of the tall buildings (the 5 grouped together in the picture at the top of the thread) could do with a bit more geometry on their ground floor sections.  Having flat windows on the upper floors is not a problem - but when you walk up close to a flat door and window on at the ground floor level then it doesn't look good.  However, they are meant to be low-poly models.<br><br>I like the way the walls of the tall buildings have a sort of 'weathered/worn' look to them.<br><br>The bungalow-type house on the far right - the red one - is very modern looking - in fact, it is built of red house bricks.<br><br>Still suspicious that this should cost $100.  I've looked at all the models in Deep Exploration, but not yet loaded all of them into Blitz3D to walk around them.  I'm itching to take a look at the castle.<br><br>It's a good pack and "Svenart" has done well.  Let's hope he has more stuff for us.<br><br>Nice one "Sven". <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I will probably edit the textures.<br><br>The building with the cartwheel and horseshoe outside it has a very nice detailed looking door texture.  Whereas many others are very washed out and undefined.  I will replace some of the other doors with this door.  There is a very noticable difference.<br><br>Doing this will help to make the ground floor sections look better - due to the flat nature.<br><br>EDIT:<br>Yet the ground floor stonework on the building with the nice door (with cartwheel) is bad compared to that of fw45.3ds (fw45.3ds being one of the buildings with a washed-out looking door).  The stonework does not tile well and is visually in rectangular patches that don't tile.<br><br>Basically, they should both have a nice door and nice stonework - not one each.<br><br>This reinforces my previous observation that the ground floor sections of the tall buildings could be better. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
