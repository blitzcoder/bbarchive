But immediately ran into a problem...<br><br>Problem:<br>For any 3d plant/tree, apart from basic modification like rotation/scaling, it was the same model. and it becomes very simple to tell it's the same model.<br><br>Solution:<br>have some form of plant generator that uses some form of random life growth, whilst still keeping generated plants similar.<br><br>So i've been working on something and here's the results:<br><img src="http://www.visualjockey.com/games/treeui6.png"><br>This is a tree model (the copies are there to show differences - but they are the exact same tree with no changes), but with growth parameters added.<br><br>For a plant, I decided that it could be constructed from up to 4 3d parts (models): Trunk, branch, leaf and flower.<br>Each part has a different way of operating, but they all fit together. and you can use as many or as few as you need.<br><br>In the above sample, the (sort of) conifer is made from the two parts:<br><img src="http://www.visualjockey.com/games/treeui1.png"><br>This is the trunk<br><br><img src="http://www.visualjockey.com/games/treeui2.png"><br>And here is a very simple leaf construct<br><br>You use a new Rameses dialog to control the parameters:<br><img src="http://www.visualjockey.com/games/treeui.png"><br>The upper parameters control length, width, etc. The middle bend<br>The lower middle parameters are only used for leafs, branches and flowers, and allow duplication, spread and the general shape<br>The bottom part shows the object list, and how the plant is made from other parts.<br><br>The first fader is 'Age', using this you can age a plant from it's smallest to it's largest version. These are calculated for each tree (very fast).<br><br>Using the previous conifer. here is the tree at different stages of age from youngest to oldest:<br><img src="http://www.visualjockey.com/games/treeui3.png"><br><img src="http://www.visualjockey.com/games/treeui4.png"><br><img src="http://www.visualjockey.com/games/treeui5.png"><br><img src="http://www.visualjockey.com/games/treeui6.png"><br><br>the thing to notice is how the leaf texture moves, grows and settles.<br><br>Each tree follows the same rules, but is different from any other tree, size, spread, even shape can be different (by adjusting the rand)<br><br>here are a couple of other shots:<br><br>some trunks<br><img src="http://www.visualjockey.com/games/treeui7.png"><br>some leaf things<br><img src="http://www.visualjockey.com/games/treeui8.png"><br>and some grass<br><img src="http://www.visualjockey.com/games/treeui9.png"><br><br><br>Still early days, but let me know your thoughts? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It is amazing how it is easy and fast to generate a full tree/plant with a few lines of code but the same work in a modeling program can take hours.<br><br>What do you think of the use of temporary rigged skinned meshes with joints (bones) so that it is possible to deform branches ? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
