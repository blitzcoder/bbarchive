I haven't decided yet if the player's ship will be limited to moving horizontally or if it will be free to roam the entire screen. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

All the models are 3D Studio Max, except the planets which are created in ZPaint.<br><br>Each enemy has one or two 256x256 images with 16 64x64 animation frames.  The above sprite is animated at 24fps, but I may bump that up to 30 in the game since it seems a bit slow.  Or I might make it vary, so it plays at that rate when sitting still and faster when moving.  I haven't decided all the specifics yet of how the aliens will move and attack.  <br><br>I haven't even decided whether I will have the stars scroll or not actually.  I probably will, but the planet will sit still in the middle of the screen for the aliens to come out from behind.  And the player will approach the planet as they get through the level.  So the planet will be orbiting, and the ship will be dropping towards it.  I don't really think anyone will care about the actual mechanics of it though, I just want it to look good, and to do that I need a lot of motion.  I considered having the stars fly towards the user, but I'm pretty sure that would just look even weirder and not as good as having them scroll.  If I have them scroll the nebula will scroll too and I'll have different bug shaped nebulas that scroll by.  The blue background behind the bug nebula will probably be about two screens tall and repeat.<br><br>But as for the attacks, I may have them fly in formations, or I may have them fly to points on the screen and sit still and then divebomb attack, or I could end up doing both.  I just don't know yet. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Given the number of assets done so far, and the actual cash I have paid out so far, (not including royalties which would increase this value by 3.5x) I'd say I've paid about $8 each for those two assets.  If you then take royalties into account, ($1000 up front, plus $2500 in royalties) that's about $28 each for those assets. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Note this is not a comment on your puzzle games as I haven't played them.  Anyway for marketing, sticking it on your website isn't gonna cut it.  You have to buy PromoSoft and submit it to hundreds of websites, and better yet, you have to get it on Realarcade and/or one of the other major gaming portals.  <br><br>But to do that you'll have to design your game with those portals in mind, because they'll want the game to have a certain type of interface as far as saving games goes, and you need to display their logos when the game starts, and they have to consider the game to be worth marketing in the first place.  Also their software doesn't work like traditional shareware where a user gets part of a game and then they buy the rest.  The user gets the whole game, but the demo is time limited to 60 minutes.  So you have to make sure the user has so much fun with your game that they want more after that time period is up, and that means shooters for example have to have enough levels and enough variation that they don't get to see everything before their time is up.<br><br>Anyway I did go to your website and look around, and I was wondering who made that space shooter on your page, "Absolute Blue".  The page make it seem like some of those games are made by different people so I can't tell for sure, but you said you want to make an action game so I'm guessing it's not yours. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
