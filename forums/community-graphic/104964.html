It's a little sparse on things to buy at the moment, but I look forward to checking in out again when there are more products.<br><br>A few bits of advice. Some of this is just my thoughts after browsing various model sites.<br><br>Try to keep the site's download time to a reasonable minimum. A site like this is going to be image heavy, but you should try to keep that to the images that help inform potential customers as much as possible. That half-megabyte image in the image slider is one I'd get rid of or reduce in filesize.<br><br>Building models will likely sell many times better if the building has an interior as well as doors. The interiors should be separate models so that they can be hidden and shown via code. Doors should also be separate models so that they can be opened and closed via code. The door should possibly have a one sided version that can be used when the player is outside and the door is closed. If your buildings have interiors then make sure that the potential customer can easily find that information, as it's a huge selling point.<br><br>Generally someone who is making a game is going to be looking for a reasonably complete set of assets with a consistent art-style that they can use for their game. The more work they have to do to integrate a model into their game's aesthetic, the less likely they are to buy that model. A mistake I see a lot of artists making on various asset stores is that they'll make a variety of different models, but they'll only make one model for something that the buyer probably needs a set of. They'll make a sci-fi pistol in a given art-style without making a complete set of sci-fi weapons in that art-style, for example. A buyer will be looking for a number of different sci-fi weapons they can integrate into their game and will be thinking of how much work it will take to integrate that one sci-fi pistol in with the art-style of the other weapons they need. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's already been said it was based on a tree plugin, which (if memory serves me right) is probably using similar internal L-System code. So would produce "similar" results. It is unfortunate that the L-System  produces very common branching results. but the leaf pattern is completely different.<br><br>If I was in the market for a tree of this type.
