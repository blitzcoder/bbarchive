Well, believe it or not, I have decided to make this an "Astrosmash" clone (remember Astrosmash from Intellivision?).  It's going to have that 3D element to it, and it will shoot two forms of bullets (the primary is the machine gun with Cyanide Bullets, and the secondary will be spinning star blades).  I'll have screenies of the weapon bullets in a minute.  For right now, here's the turret itself, I just got it done this morning.  It's well shaded, and I did the best I could on the 3D elements of it.  Corel's PSP X does a fairly decent job in doing the "Hollywood" effects on some of these.  <br><br><img src="http://img95.imageshack.us/img95/1395/player6hf.png"><br><br>Seems like a nice cannon for an "Astrosmash" clone, and hope the "Blue Sky Rangers" won't mind a clone of their flagship game.  Of course, Plasmorg's going to take Astrosmash to the next level.  If it were any better, I'd try an FPS turret-based version with crosshairs, and the asteroids would crack your windshield.  That'll be my next version... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Of course, digital art's not nearly as strong as my handsketching.  My landscape art in pencil and paper's far superior to doing anything like this.  Of course, my scanner will only make it too grainy to render as a digital image.  Of course, I am trying in the 3D modeling art myself, having just picked up a book on learning Maya 7.  Of course, now that I base my polygons on the binary system, that does tend to make me do digital art in multiples of 4 or 8, which will make a 3D image, but having to shrink down a large image, that will tend to make the graphic lose quality.  On top of that with Corel PSP X, their effects aren't exactly "Hollywood" quality, either.  Wish that Corel would've never bought out Jasc like that.

He just took four of those blocks, and clustered them into different shapes, and colored those blocks to make it different from the next.  I guess Miyamoto was a good friend of Pajitnov, up until THQ bought the rights to Elorg's Tetris publishing.  I guess that Tetris got too popular for Nintendo to handle alone...  <br><br>Ahem, back on topic.  Seems like my Plasmorg project has taken on different forms during the past few months.  I thought I had a plan every time, trying to see what would make retro arcade gaming popular again, yet, having a concept that'll take and make a "hybrid" of different arcade classics, and turning it into an original classic.  Whew, this is gonna take some thinking...  Of course, here we have a hybrid of Tetris, Mario Bros. and Astrosmash (or Space Invaders, whatever the case may be), maybe a little Asteroids, too...  Either way, it'll most certainly become more definitive as the days go along...  <br><br>Don't worry, I can get around that legal loophole with the president of Nintendo soon enough, I built these tile graphics from the ground up, so I have good reason...  As far as UFOs dropping from the sky, and trying to land-crash into a tank cannon firing bullets and grenades, well, it'll be something to consider in the next, who knows how long... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's just that I'm looking to revive retro arcade in a new way, and having something to port into my GBA (once the SDK and flash card get over here).  I'm just not too sure whether or not the GBA can handle 3D renditions.  Maybe it was the DS that can only handle 2D, and the GBA SP handles 3D?  Not too sure to be honest with you.  Well, whatever the case, this looks like it'll be something to consider simultaneously releasing for both GBA and Pocket PC formats.  A game like this would be too boring for a home console or desktop PC.  For a handheld, tho, this may be perfect... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I may consider having this as a castle shooter where you have a catapult-type cannon, and you have to shoot down gargoyles or dragons (haven't decided) before they dive and crash into you.  This may be perhaps the best theme for the moment.  Designing space and military shooters sort of don't agree with me for some strange reason, it's just a good feeling to go with my gut, and do a theme I can be strong in... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
