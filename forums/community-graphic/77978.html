However:<br><br>1) Judging by the size of the door, if you were standing in the building your crotch and stomach would be on the same level as the windows. This is because the door is not scaled consistently with the rest of the building. Reducing the size of the door by about 35% should fix the problem.<br><br>2) The building would benefit from a little extra detail. For example, you might think about adding ledges beneath the windows.<br><br>3) Everything is too straight and perfect. Adding a little distortion here and there (a slightly crooked chimney, a sagging roof, walls that "lean" a little bit) would enhance the charm and character. Everything is too perfect and "boxy" at the moment.<br><br>EDIT: Think about Brasov or Sighisoara. Beautiful places, right? Take a look at some photos of them. You'll notice how none of the lovely streets and buildings have perfectly straight, clean angles and edges. You'll also see that it is all the little details that make the architecture so appealing. You might even want to model some of <i>your</i> medieval buildings on some of the fantastic buildings in these places. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Not everything is uniform and perfectly shaped- although it would be nice if that were the case.  Also, most of your textures lack depth.  This is partly because your models are too simplistic.  You focus on the most basic forms and then exclude the details.  Model the apples, model the rings on the barrel and define the top.  Also, most barrels have metal rings surrounding the top (otherwise the wood would not hold).<br><br>You're doing better than the Arteria gits, but you've got a ways to go yet.  If you don't already do so, sketch these sorts of things daily.  (Keep in mind that a sketch is a sketch, not a giant, finished painting- if it helps, spend only 10 minutes at a time, use a pen, and never try to correct mistakes.) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
