It's a photomosaic of her Welsh Corgi:<br><br><img src="http://users.adelphia.net/~scswift/mosaic-thumb.jpg"><br><br><a href="http://users.adelphia.net/~scswift/mosaic-full.jpg" target="_blank">Click here for a full size image.</a><br><br>If you'd like to make a photomosaic like this, what you need to do is get <a href="http://andreaplanet.com/andreamosaic/" target="_blank">this program</a>. <br><br>Then take a bunch of images and make them all 160x120, which is roughly the res you'll need for a 600 dpi printed page. (The actual full size image I printed is twice the resolution of the one linked to above.) <br><br>Then you pick a source image that is the overall image you want the smaller images to form.  This should be an image which looks good at thumbnail size.  Large areas of different color, with nice shading will look best.<br><br>Then I reccomend you set the program so that it is allowed to modify the final images by up to 50%.  Of course if you have a very large number of thumbnail images, you might not need to do that to get a good final image, but I find the lack of contrast in the thumbnails looks nicer overall than a very noisy image generated by unmodified thumbnails.  I only had 22 different images to use, so the system couldn't match up the colors very well, hence the 50% settting to cheat and adjust the colors.<br><br>I think that having a four pixel black border around the thumbs also looks better than having no border at all which is the default.  The black border around the entire image I added in photoshop myself. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Some guy invented "photomosaics", and they have a website, and the front page basically says something like photomosaic is a trademark, and the algorithms and "look and feel" of the photomosaic are protected by patents.  It's so stupid, and it doesn't seem to actually have stopped anyone from producing programs like these.  Perhaps they're only out to sue people with lots of money who make them, but it still would seem a risky venture.<br><br>And my sister's birthday is on the 20th, we're celebrating early because she has to work tuesday.<br><br>My birthday is on the 20th as well, but of March.  She always got pissed off when I'd get nice gifts on my birthday because her birthday is so close to christmas she usually got less expensive gifts.  Plus I like expensive things like computers and four wheelers. :-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
