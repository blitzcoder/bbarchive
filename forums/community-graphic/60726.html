(the free license to Aurora has already been doled out... sorrrryyyy :)  )  the rules are loose and accomodating...<br><br>ok,  the first target is something i saw that really got me hot and bothered... a screenshot from a decent looking project that won a compo to get a no money up front license to use Unigine to develop their game with...<br><br><img src="http://home.att.net/~mikey102/UnigineAfterfall.jpg"><br><br>can i come close...<br><br>(btw, it's only fair to mention that this pic and all rights to it belong to the copyright holders mentioned in the image... if you have a chance, visit their site and check out Unigine as well)<br><br>one week starting from this monday will be the drop dead date... i challenge myself to come up with a scene as close to this as can be done  with either Blitz3D, or Blitzmax wrapped to another engine, or simply using one of those engines sans 'Max (for those who haven't yet licensed it)...<br><br>after monday,  we can have a lil post mortem review and judging... then if there is still any interest, the next target will be posted...<br><br>--Mike <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If the textures were the same, welding the vertices would fix it, but since they're not, it won't. They're z-fighting, I assume. You could try W-Buffer instead. Also try increasing the near setting on CameraView.<br><br>Not sure why no one's impressed with the pictures. Perhaps they're seeing things that aren't there. I may be wrong, but I don't think that scene is lightmapped. I think the shadows are stencils ( ie: realtime and will react to the light source ) and I think the lighting is PRT, which is pretty much realtime global illumination. I think that's enough to keep anyone busy for a week ;)<br><br>Course I could be wrong on what's what too. I guess we none of us know without seeing it running. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
