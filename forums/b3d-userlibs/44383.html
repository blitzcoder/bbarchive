Because of this, BlitzMovie can now decode direct to these surfaces, resulting in the fastest performance yet. Also included are new set volume and mute volume functions as well as a means to check the state of the movie. Whether it's playing, paused or stopped.<br><br>I have some big plans for BlitzMovie, mainly implementing a cross platform BlitzMax version centred around xiph.org's new patent free movie codec, Theora. And implementing a brand new version for BlitzPlus users is a high priority too.<br><br>Alas, I don't have as much time as I'd like to spend on BlitzMovie (especially a BlitzMax version) and the reason is another project I've been working on since late November 2004... a map editor called <b>DifJam</b>. Please click <a href="http://www.harrimansoftware.com/difjam/preview.png" target="_blank"><b>HERE</b></a> to see a screenshot of the current build, which as you can see is still in development.<br><br>Let me tell you, the csg operations in this so far are rock solid, as seems to be the app itself. I intend to make this application very easy to use and as it's crafted using C++, wxWidgets and OpenGL, there'll be a MACOSX and Linux version too. It will be a great way of creating Blitz levels, for Blitz3D and for BlitzMax when 3D functionality appears. The initial release will feature direct export to Blitz3D and Gile[s] formats. As of yet, there's no plans to include a lightmapper as Gile[s] is just so good at it. :)<br><br>I'm very interested to know whether there's enthusiasm for this product and whether people would be willing to buy it??? Unlike BlitzMovie, which will only ever be free, DifJam will never be free. I'm thinking around the $39.95 - $49.95 US mark when it's released, which I anticipate to be in about 2-4 months time.<br><br>And lastly, you may be wondering where the name DifJam comes from??? It's because the editor was originally started as a means for Torque Engine owners to have an easy to use, reliable program to export to Torque's DIF format.<br><br>Anyway, hope you enjoy the new BlitzMovie and if you find any bugs, please send them to my email address below. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Now the MoviePlay Process is still active and really freezes my system, so I got to reboot. If there was some kind of Kill-Process thing, that would be nice. Like when it listens to the taskmanager and accepts to be finished by it (and closes the opened Movie), or maybe it's possible to get some special keystroke combination, like CTRL-C (well I know, it's probably hard to get Keyhits when there is no focus). Anyway, this would make things much easier.<br><br>But all in all it's a great progress since Version 1.1.

The original price I stated is based on the main competition, Cartography Shop which is $65??? But the price you talked about is to bear in mind too.<br><br>Maybe I'm misunderstanding though, but it seems to me that the concensus is, there's loads of map editors available and another one isn't needed??? I don't understand if this is the case. As I mentioned in the first post, DifJam was started as a means for people to be able to make a map easily for the Torque Engine. I mean, c'mon, have you tried QuArK, the recommended tool of Torque??? It's absolutely horrible to use. Also, DifJam has been built from the ground up in C++, wxWidgets and OpenGL so it's easy to port to MACOSX and Linux. People on the Torque Engine forums are always moaning about the need for a map editing tool, especially for MACOSX. We're almost there, sent an email to Garage Games and did we receive a reply??? I just don't understand at all???<br><br>Editors such as Hammer, Radiant and UnrealED are truly excellent, granted. Try and use them for your own productions though and see what happens on the legal side. Which brings you around to two alternatives for commercial productions... QuArK and Cartography Shop. This is why I thought there was room for another editor.<br><br>Halo has a vision with Cartography Shop, to make it an all in one engine. Whilst an admirable aim, I merely wish to make a csg level editor for whatever engine is required, be this Blitz3D, BlitzMax, DarkBasic or Torque, or some custom engine at a later date. Think I need to learn more about .so??? files on MAC and Linux first though. Or extendible through Lua or Python???<br><br>I have recently started a games company with my best friend, specialising in Java games for mobile phones. Already, we have playable prototypes and a lot of interest and it's looking like for DifJam we'll add an ability at some point to export stuff in m3g format. So this is perhaps another avenue for us to explore. Basically, I intend for DifJam to become a recognised solution for level building. And asking the opinions of seasoned Blitz3D users was something I really wanted to do. Thanks a lot. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

; Many thanks to tom@... for the information on how to get at

;Added Fullscreen Scaling by jfk

; This example will play any movie at Fullscreen size. It is using a Pseudo TV-Scanline Effect
; that will magicly enhance the look of very small movies that are played in Fullscreen
; Mode.
; However, on TFT Crystal Displays you should set gr_w and gr_h to your physical Screen 
; Resolution to prevent an ugly Moiree Effect from the TV-Scanline effect.

The Bluebox Functions are kind of poor, EG. they don't offer smoothing contours after mixing the frames. This is where blitz comes in - well I thought so.

Mci opens a "window" to play Avis. You can then set the parent window for this movie window-canvas. Although this canvas is now a child of the Blitz window, it wasn't possible to capture the movie frames on the Blitz Window. So I used Bitblit. But even Bitblit didn't allow to grab the frames on the Blitz window, for some strange reason. I then used Toms Blitz Imagebuffer Adress Hack to copy the frame content after a Bliblit to a Blitz Image buffer.(well, it was a complicated multi-step solution from mci via Bitblit to a Bitmap that was created using CreateCompatibleBitmap, then the bitmap was copied to the blitz imagebuffer, using the bended/hacked vector) It worked, although it was pretty slow. I made some benchmark tests and it turned out that bitblit was the slow part.<br>So if there is a way to move an avi frame from the player directly into a blitz image buffer, this would be fast. Everything else seems to be too slow.<br><br>BTW the Imagebuffer hack is based on the fact that Imagebuffer(img)+72 returns the Image Data adress. (Of course, pretty dirty code) A Bank handle has its data adress at offset 4 (bank+4) and the size of the bank at offset 8. So it's possible to steal/bend a bank handles vector and redirect it to an Image Buffer, by writing the adress of the imagebuffers data adress to bank+4 and the size of the image to bank+8 (using RTLMoveMemory). You can then use Userlib commands to receive data directly in a blitz image buffer. Of course, prior program termination the bank should be restored to it's original state (so the content of bank+4 and bank+8 after creation must be backed up. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

On slwo computers this may take a lot of time, eg. on MP4 codecs it may take several seconds.<br>Playing the movie frame by frame is a lot faster, although still not 60 frames per second or so, when you have a big resolution, like eg. 720*576 Pixels (that's what I use it for, PAL DV-Camcoder format).<br><br>Currently I am working on a Bluebox App (well in fact it may use any masking color, prefered green these days), that is capable of putting a masked frame on a background frame, then recognize the contours of the masked object and blur them with the background, in respect to the interlaced Frames (BFF,TFF or progressive).

I mean, are the colours wrong or anything??? Or is just that it's running really bad. Just for a test, I remember you said you have dual display, what happens if you switch to single display and then run it??? I have a dual display too and the other day I happened to notice that you can turn on / off acceleration for both displays. I guess it might be worth checking that acceleration is enabled for both your outputs. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Just to clarify, I would say that the movie plays at the correct speed *internally* but I only see the texture updated roughly every two seconds--but the rate is pretty erratic.  The image flickers at a quick rate--sort of like a movie projector effect.  Other than that the image quality is perfect.<br><br>I haven't seen anywhere that I can turn on acceleration for both displays.  What version driver are you using?  Blitz certainly is not accelerated on both displays;  however some other programs will (possibly just OpenGL applications) run with acceleration on both. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
