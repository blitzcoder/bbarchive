It's too slow, obviously. However, estimations put decent performance at 800 MHz, whereas my target audience really needs to be around 500 MHz.<br><br>To get realistic gravity, gravity's set high with 3 samples. I'm wondering if the new Tokamak has fixed the need for high samples? Development's on a temporary hold so can't try it myself at the mo'. If not, is there an alternative physics engine that runs on a much faster solver? <br><br>I've got practically zip money to spend, to free is good. I also don't need any fancy features. Sphere, boxes, custom static scenery meshes to collide with. Tokamak has so far been very simple for me and great. The only reason to consider a change is better performance. How do Newton and ODE rate, pricewise and performance wise (don't care for features!)<br><br>cheers <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

( www.trueaxis.com ).<br>This engine make use of swept collision tests which make sure that a collision is never missed, regardless of the objects velocity.<br><br>It's free for non-commercial use but will cost you some bucks if you want to use it for a commercial project.<br>The author mentioned something about an "indie/hobby" developer license though, so it might be worth contacting him for details.<br>True Axis seems to include a "Blitz-friendly" dll so you should be able to use it by simply making a Declsfile for it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

My computer's heading up the swanny until I get to reinstall everything, development's on hold. I'll give 1.2.1 a try before looking for other solutions then.<br><br>BTW : has anyone got realistic gravity working with low subsamples? In Tok I found a gravity of I think 35 was about right for the speed, and 3 samples. Ordinarily physics based code seems to run in 'slow motion' and I haven't seen anything running more or less at real-world speeds. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
