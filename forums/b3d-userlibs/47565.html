It isn't a GUI system with windows and stuff.  <br><br>It is a GUI system which lets you overlay sprites on the screen, and create text of any resolution using as few textures and surfaces as possible. <br><br>The text can wrap automatically.<br><br>What makes it a GUI system is that there are functions that tell you when you are over these sprites or text objects.  There are functions that tell you when the mouse has entered one, or exited one.<br><br>And there are two animation systems that come with it that support animationg motion and the brush properites, using linear naimation or sine waves, and the animations can be one shot, looped, or ping pong.<br><br>AND it will tell you when an animation is finished.<br><br>So you can make a sprite for each menu item on your main menu, and make them zoom in from off screen, slow down, and come to a stop in the desired location.  AND you an make them become prgressively less transparent while doing this.  AND you can query the system to tell when the animation is done so you can start checking for input.  AND you can check to see if the mosue has entered a sprite.  And when you detect this you can set the animation to a glowing image animation.  And you can detect when the mouse exits a sprite.  And set the animation back to normal.  <br><br>Not only can you do all that, but the system also has basic life bars which are linear or circular.  You set the value and the bar's length changes.<br><br>Also, the system supports groups, so you can specify that all the menu sprites are in group 1, and hide group 1 to hide all those sprites at once.<br><br>Click the link below in my sig for a demo. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This works very well, but not on older cards that can't mix 2D and 3D. So on my Ti4200 it has no impact. On a test machine with GeForce 2 (I think) the 2D cripples the 3D. I can get round this by disabling the 2D drawing (mouse) while the 3D is being drawn, but that's far from ideal for most games.<br><br>If you need graphics in/over 3D, sswift's is probably a good buy, but realise you won't get perfect clarity on text, especially small text, or bitmaps, because of the limitations of combining 2D and 3D (which aren't his fault!). If you need clarity (text based RPG for example) and can freeze out the 2D aspect when drawing in 3D, or if you're only targetting better spec'd cards, use 2D drawing functions, but I don't think there's any library out there to help.

My GUI system has a function you call to correct for this change in pixel aspect ratio.  As far as I know, it should work fine with any resolution, BUT, a display designed to be viewed on a 640x480 screen is not going to be able to be viewed properly on a wide screen anyway.  Either the graphics would have to be stuck in the middle of the screen to keep the same layout, or they would be stretched wider than normal to keep the same layout.  As far as I know, my system would stretch them as you might expect it to.  I'm sure you could adjust this so it crops the top and bottom instead, and then have a different position for each GUI element based on whether you have a widescreen view or not. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This is because 3D textures aren't rendered pixel to pixel with the screen, even if of the same resolution. You can't get perfectly clear 10pt text, especially in some fonts, by writing to a texture and displaying this on a 3D sprite/plane. It's a limitation of using textures to display text.<br><br>I did a lot of testing in Blitz3D with a texture mapped plane, white pixels on black background, and never could I get it to display as that in 3D. There were greyscale pixels, a sort of fuzziness around the edges (antialiasing even!), and slight moire interference patterns, caused by interpolating texels for pixels. eg. Create a 128 pixel square chequered bitmap of alternating black and white pixels, map it to a square mesh, and display it at 128x128 pixels on screen. You won't get the same pixel clarity as the original.<br><br>So it's a tradeoff between 3D performance and pixel clarity. For what most games want, where the text will be fairly large, your system works fine. Even some small text looks okay. But if you want pixel perfect clarity only a 2D system works. I don't think it's at all possible on any 3D hardware to get perfect pixel clarity when drawing in 3D.<br><br>As a point of note I've just realised, does the sswift system use a powers of 2 interface texture (such as 512x256 or 1024x1024)? If I remember right the texture you draw to is set to 800x600. Graphics cards work ideally on powers of 2 textures. I found this out with some crazy artefacts when scaling a background bitmap that disappeared when I scaled it to 256x256. You might get better quality from the sswift system if you change the interface resolution to 1024x1024 and only show part of it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You need to get the top left corner of the texture in the CENTER of the top left pixel.  The corners of all the texels must be aligned to the pixel centers.
