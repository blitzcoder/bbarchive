Something still seems wrong with the Quat&lt;&gt;Euler rotation equations at the moment, they seem to be converting pitch, yaw and roll incorrectly. The previous versions worked around this problem but that's what broke the TriMesh, so I must tread carefully. I'll move on to the cylinder issues once the rotation is corrected properly. If it takes a while to fix the rotation, it might be worth leaving the cylinders until V1.04 so that you can all tinker with the TriMesh stuff in the mean time.<br><br>Anyway, back to the grindstone...  :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Physics in a indie game is not that common even these days, so it makes me and my game look "pro" and hopefully much more fun and even someways more easier for me to code.<br><br>-I don't need the source code because I don't have a suitable compiler and wouldn't be able to understand the source code anyways - if I would, then I would have done this wrapper myself :)<br><br>Open sourcing it just leads to this and that version made by this and that, and all being broken somehow but slightly differently. It would be a nightmare trying to guess who has the "best version today" - no, keep it simple and so that only two coders make the updates IMO. So what VIP3R / Jedive / Halo are saying above I agree 101%. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
