And the worse, you have to pay a lot of money for them if you do a commercial project...<br><br>Well, worry no more, I just developed a library (with pure Blitz3D code) that uses Windows MCI to play MP3 files.<br><br>You can open multiple files at once, play them, pause/resume/loop, get song length and position, change their volume, speed, etc - with minimum overhead; and you can load/unload the songs at any time, unlike Blitz PlayMusic!<br><br>Also, you can use all normal blitz sound/music-related commands together with this lib!<br><br>You can get the sample code (without the .decls file and the include) to test it (comes with pre-compiled sample) and see how it works. I successfully tested it on Win98 and WinXP. <br><br>This code should work on any Windows machine, as long as you are able to play MP3 files on Windows Media Player.<br><br>The sample can be downloaded from here: <a href="http://www.icongames.com.br/mciMP3/mciMP3.zip" target="_blank">http://www.icongames.com.br/mciMP3/mciMP3.zip</a><br><br>My question: is this worth something? I was thinking about a price around $10. Would anyone be interested in purchasing such lib? I still would have to make an website for it, documentation, etc. <br><br>I would also would like to know if anyone finds some bug on the sample, so I can track it down. It shouldnt have any, but you never know ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
