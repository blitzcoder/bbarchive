Like I said though I never was able to achieve a decent result. Also the rear-wheel steering problem always caused problems at any reasonable speeds.<br><br>I'd love to see an ODE demo with the high-speed rotational stability solved, the unwanted rear-wheel steer sorted and the friction allowing for controlled power-sliding - if this was managed and ODE is so much faster than Tokamak as you say then obviously I'd prefer to use ODE (although I'd say that having to call the physics 3 times to alleviate the stability problem negates the speed advantage - speed vs accuracy perhaps?)<br><br>Until I see otherwise I think that Tokamak produces cars that are more fun to drive than ODE cars, unless you are willing to delve in Pacejka and some really complex maths, which unfortunately is way beyond me. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

They also need balancing to prevent from wobbling (causing heavy vibration) at high speed, right?<br><br>Maybe ODE is reflecting reality and certain conditions hinder the problem or amplify it? Some tests I've done have shown huge differences in the problem, depending on something as simple as how much mass is applied to the wheel itself. Correcting the wheel mass alone results in a far higher stable speed. The wobbles will still occur but at a much higher rotation speed than before.<br><br>Altering the step rate can also help, but as you say it becomes a speed vs accuracy scenario then. But, as ODE is much faster you could probably call ODE up to 4x per loop and still achieve the same frame speeds as 1x TokaMak per loop.<br><br>For all we know Boiled Sweets might not be thinking of a car sim anyway :P <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Low values for mu, averaged between wheel and road, would cause little variation between the two directions. On a road surface of mu=0, 100% friction for a fast spinning wheel might be something like mu=10,000, and you'd be looking at mu=1,000 for half the friction. The friction values for ODE aren;t straightforward, but I've never tried anisotropic frictions so can only guess this might be a problem, if it isn't fundamentally broken in the engine. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I have also been through most of the ODE mailing list (2 or 3 years worth) and these same problems crop up time after time after time, with no one able to offer reliable solutions.<br><br>1. the car flips very easily - even if the car has a large mass it flips over as a result of the slightest impact.<br><br>2. the friction is very all-or-nothing - the front grips, then it slips, making the car slide outwards out of control. Even when I get it drifting it's unrecoverable - opposite lock does nothing.<br><br>3. ODE seems to self-destruct with no warning, even with very slight changes to certain physics params, and it can happen midway through a simulation that seems perfectly stable, apparently from the slightest impact - wheels get caught up on inclines of a few degrees, either causing the car to stop instantly, or the simulation to explode.<br><br>4. there seems to be no way to directly adjust the inertia/momentum of a body, both angular and linear.<br><br>I still maintain that Tokamak is better - the car layout I have in Tokamak is very similar to that in the ODE test, yet the Tokamak sim has never exhibited any of the above problems - it is predictable and consistent, something that ODE doesn't seem to manage very well - running the same sim over and over produces widly varying results from just slight changes in velocity or position - take a jump at X velocity and you land OK, take it at X+1 and the car is flipped end over end.
