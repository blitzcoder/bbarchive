But, it just still insists that the .dll (Bass) wont initialize.<br><br>It's a shame really if I am the only person on the planet, having difficulties with Bass and Blitz. As for one thing I had a whole heap of ideas for special fx to try out and interact with. <br><br>I thought it had to do with the last couple ofupdates, as everything worked around then. But no one at BR seems to really know, as the bug report has been up with no trace of recognition. Not that im complaining mind, just frustrated thats all.<br><br>If anyone can help put me out of my mysery with suggestions in getting Bass to init.

So it's defineatly the IDE at fault!!<br><br>I've also used the test / example programs that come with the full Bass package from Un4Seen - and they worked without hesitation.<br><br>I thought it may be an IDE fault with DEP, however I have Data Execution Prevention set to 'Turn On DEP for essential windows programs and services only' - so it 'should' be disabled for anything none Windows XP SP2?<br><br>Any help in this matter, is greatly appreciated - as Im at my wits end over this.<br><br>Thanks so much,<br>Clyde :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I believe this is my first post, after lurking for almost a year.<br><br>I've been struggling with the same bass.dll problem.<br><br>I had a bass.dll in my c:\windows\system32 folder.<br>It was leftover from a program I tried that used bass.<br><br>I renamed that file so it would not be picked up by the IDE.<br><br>Then I made sure that my C:\Program Files\Blitz3D\userlibs folder contained bass.dll and bass.decls.<br><br>I'm not sure what effect it has if you have the bass.dll and decls files in the same folder as your project. Probably the neatest way is to have them in the userlibs folder.<br><br>The decls file version is something I can't seem to figure out for sure... but to find out the version of the bass.dll, use Dependency Walker. If it's not installed on your system, download it (from Microsoft I think).<br>With that installed, you can double-click the dll file and you get a comprehensive information window telling you the version ("Image Ver" column in the bottom pane), as well as a list of the functions available in the dll.<br><br>The point here is that it looks like the decls file must be matched to the dll version. I think. Someone please correct me if this is wrong, as it still confuses me.<br><br>Also, if your project has <br>  include "bass.bb"<br>make sure that bass.bb is in the same folder as your main project, or that the include points to the right path/file.<br><br>Hope this helps.<br>As I said, I'm still struggling with it myself. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

And for not being able to detect my sound card? It's bizzarre that bass induced bb programs compile and work as executables, but cause grief within the IDE.<br><br>I'd of thought there's only one set of decals for bass.

Same goes for the decls file, I think.<br>Whether or not one in the system32 folder makes a difference is anyone's guess!<br>Regardless, if they are different versions, it seems that it may be the cause of some problems.<br><br>I think the decls can differ, if any functions exposed by the dll have differing parameter lists from version to version.<br>But I really don't know enough about decls files to say for sure, so I'm definitely open to correction here!<br><br>As for an executable working, and within the IDE not working, I would guess that is because the decls are compiled into the executable, and the bass.dll supplied with an executable matches the decls compiled in.<br><br>Disclaimer: this is only a theory - it could be complete hogwash for all I know.
