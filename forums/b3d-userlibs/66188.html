No physics engine I know of (that's free!) have all their features working perfectly..<br><br>I've spend a lot (a lot!) of time previously using Tokamak and always had trouble with loads of unexpected results and problems (if you go a bit more complex than just tossing cubes around). It was fun working with it but I never thought it predicatble or stable enough to actually release anything serious with it. I wouldn't advise investing your time in an engine that's pretty much dead from a development point of view. As far as I know, Tokamak development has been dead for years now.<br><br>I later switched to JV-ODE which is one of the best buys I've ever did!! It's much more stable, easier to use, behaves much more predictable, has more options when it comes to joints and motors. And most importantly, ODE is still being developed and has a very active community! I receive regular updates, and not in the least, vip3r (who made the b3d wrapper for ode) gives superb support and there's few things he can't solve! He only charges the price of a couple pints for his wrapper, so worth every penny!!<br><br>hope that helps,<br>Danny. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In Tokamak I have achieved much better results, partly I think down to the contact friction system, which seems to give less of the "full grip or full slip" problems that you get with ODE.<br><br>If you look at almost all ODE vehicle demos they work really well at slow speeds (the carwheel joint suspension system is excellent over bumps) but go a bit faster and you get that inevitable full grip to sudden slide situation. Tokamak seems to provide a much nicer break-away, which means the wheels can slide and grip under the player control, rather than an instant spin as happens in ODE. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It is an inherit flaw in ODE to this day, it has been improved but never removed. It's a shame.<br><br>I used Vorderman's ODE In the Car Engine/Fun Racer which I teamed up with Evak for. Many many months went into tweaking ODE and preventing rear wheel slide.<br><br>So it is possible to do decent cars at high speed in ODE but the method in which to do it is much much more complicated than it needs to be- I do it by running the physics sumulation twice per update, first at 1.5 speed and then at 0.5 speed, which reduces the effect.<br><br>I did however have to calculate what was sliding and when, by myself as as Vorderman says, ODE is either on, or off, but not both.<br>Tokamak's vehicles can be seen in action in Vorderman's Stunt Car Racer (I think I got that right!). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The friction works very well, but the lack of a decent suspension joint makes landings sometimes unpredictable, but I'd rather have the occasional dodgy landing than constant snap sliding and uncontrollable drifting. Depends upon the aim of your game I suppose - a slower 4x4 offroad game would be much better suited to ODE. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
