It'll be both faster and a lot more robust. I would stay well clear of trimeshes for something like a platformer. A heightmap terrain is probably one of the few situations where they'd actually be useful though.<br><br>A rule that's worth repeating ad-nauseam is that you shouldn't attempt to use your render mesh for collision purposes (just in case you were thinking of doing that). Instead, build a nice even, simplified, low-poly version where you absolutely need meshes, and stack logical boxes together where you don't; and use that secondary construct. You don't need (or want) fine details on a collision mesh, but you do want high performance, even surfaces, and reliably solid floors. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you can't get it working by yourself, give the developer a message and see if he can explain what's going wrong. I don't know how "live" it is in that respect nowadays but it certainly used to be very well supported indeed, VIP3R always happy to answer sensible questions.<br><br>Firstly though... how big is "big"? Are you running up against the limits of floating-point precision? If so you might be able to solve the problem by chopping your world up into smaller sections and either disabling physics for distant objects, or using a scaled LOD-physics system for large items that still need to be simulated at long range. (Consider the Elder Scrolls for a good example of how to disable areas that are out of range: the "world" is only a couple of hundred metres across at any given time, but centred in a scaled LOD-world that represents a larger space around it, and when you go near to a boundary, the point of origin is moved and you enter a second world space seamlessly matched up to the one you were just in.)<br><br>Single-precision floating point only has 2^23 points of precision to play in. Once you consider that objects move in steps hundredths of their size per-frame (for smooth movement), you can only have a reliable world space a few tens of thousands of times the radius of an object.<br><br>(Assuming that precision is the problem, you could also fix this issue by using an engine that supports double-precision collisions, but I would seriously question whether you need to be simulating every penny that drops a hundred kilometres away - it's just a waste of power.)<br><br><br>It's also worth pointing out that trimeshes are inherently unreliable as colliders, because their nature as an infinitely-thin 2D surface means that some high-speed collisions can leave the engine not knowing exactly what side of the polygon a collider is supposed to be, because it has no depth. JV-ODE has written a lot of code around this problem to make it work in more situations, but this is one reason why purely logical "shape" colliders are so much more reliable (and faster) - they have a well-defined "inside". <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
