You just separate the upwards and downwards-pointing faces with a vertical wall, equal to the height of the shaft of the capsule, and run sphere collision on it:<br><img src="http://www.leadwerks.com/post/collision.png"><br><br>However, this means you have one "heightened" copy of the map, which collides with players, and one regular copy, which collides with crates and things.  Is it possible to mix the two, and still have the player affect crates, and vice-versa?<br><br>To clarify:  Crates collide with one copy of the map, and with players.  Players collide with crates, and a modified copy of the map.  Crates to not collide with the modified copy of the map, and players do not collide with the unmodified copy of the map. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

We have already seen what kind of response one gets from trying to answer your questions.  No wonder the author of a physics engine was upset at you for telling him how 'easy' it would be to do certain things.<br><br>Your CShop is pretty cool, and I'll keep checking it out.  Since you told off the physics engine author that you make tons of money off of your dev tools, why not PAY the guy, or another developer whom you haven't broken contact with, to add those features you want!<br><br>It seems to be pretty important to you, as you keep posting about every physics engine yet argue at the developer once you decide he doesn't have what you need.  Why not pay him instead of yelling at him, if you are as rich as you told the guy you are :)<br><br>Somewhere in a different post, Swift had a great idea about using two spheres!<br><br>Good luck and hope you share what you find! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
