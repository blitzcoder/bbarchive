With respect, if you understand what opengl is all about then you will also understand that it's people like you (and me) that have to help promote opengl at any/every opportunity. It's fair to say that even by using opengl in your progs (assuming you are explicit about it) you *are* promoting it but then to suggest something like GLDirect sort of defeats the whole exercise.<br><br>PS: I have nothing against GLDirect.

It's one thing for Id to use OpenGL, knowing that their reputation is such that people who want to play their games will (i) have high(er) end rigs and (ii) be comfortable getting their drivers in order, but wouldn't you have to be a bit of a spanner to use OGL for shareware aimed at PC people who typically own weaker machines and who think that updating drivers is some sort of witchcraft? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
