Even if malware manages to write executable code into memory somewhere, DEP makes it a lot harder for the computer to 'accidentally' execute and activate that code.<br><br>The older versions of Blitzbasic/Blitzplus/B3D didnt' follow all those rules, so Windows' built-in DEP prevention would keep them from working properly. At one point BRL released an update to their compilers to follow the DEP rules, and the errors went away. (for B3D, that was version 1.88 and up -- code compiled with 1.87 or below likely won't work anymore on most computers)<br><br>If you DO have an ancient program that's not DEP compatible, you can make an exception in the windows DEP configuration to tell it not to enforce DEP for tht particular executable. computer properties -&gt; Advanced Settings -&gt; Performance -&gt; Settings -&gt; Data Execution Prevention -&gt; "Turn on DEP for all programs and services except those I select" <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
