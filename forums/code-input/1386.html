With a couple of API calls you can retrieve the current user setting, change it for your game, and put it back again at the end. It's a hack, but it's vital for certain purposes and the worst possible outcome is a crashed exe doesn't put the sensitivity back right. </td></tr><tr ><td class="cell"><pre class="code">You need the following DECLS in your Userlibs folder :

[code]
.lib "mouse.dll"

GetMouseSensitivity%()          :"GetMouseSensitivity"
SetMouseSensitivity%(Sense%)    :"SetMouseSensitivity"
[/code]


You also need my mouse DLL, written in PureBasic. If you have PureBasic, you can compile the following source to a DLL :

[code]
#SPI_GETMOUSESPEED=112
#SPI_SETMOUSESPEED=113

ProcedureDLL.l GetMouseSensitivity()
  MouseSpeed.l=0
  SystemParametersInfo_(#SPI_GETMOUSESPEED,0,@MouseSpeed,#SPIF_SENDWININICHANGE)
  ProcedureReturn MouseSpeed
EndProcedure 

ProcedureDLL SetMouseSensitivity(Sense.l)
  SystemParametersInfo_(#SPI_SETMOUSESPEED,0,Sense,#SPIF_SENDWININICHANGE)
EndProcedure
[/code]

If you don't have PureBasic, you can use this UUEncoded data to reproduce the DLL. Credits to Perturbatio for the Encoded DLL and link to the Decoder.

To turn this code into a DLL, you'll need a UUDecoder, which can be found here : [a http://www.bastet.com/software/software.html]http://www.bastet.com/software/software.html[/a]
