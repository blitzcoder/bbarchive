Next i found ozak's wrapper which looked nice, but still obligated you to use several enet commands mixed with other functions. So i made my one wrapper and it already works as far as that i can connect and disconnect and send (un/reliable) packets. Which is pretty much everything i need. <br><br>Now the problem is that i have no idea how to get the IP and Port of other peers (PCs you're connected to). I don't really need it but the wrapper/lib just doesn't feel complete without that feature. <br><br>BRL's wrapper had a function for it but as far as i can tell, it doesn't work. ENet saves the ip/port in the ENetPeers structure, as can be seen in the documentation on their homepage - which is quite nice by the way. I can't extern that one because i ran into several problems when doing so, i.e. i need to save them in TLists, etc. BRL just did it with pointer arithmetics: <br><br>Local ip=(Int Ptr peer)[0]<br><br>As mentioned, this doesn't work for me and they don't use it in gnet either. I'm quite new to wrapping c++ libraries therefore i hope someone here can help me. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I played a bit with the numbers in the angular brackets and with [3] for IP and [8] for port it worked. The client's port is a bit weird though (33009 or so), that's probably the reason why i didn't find it before.<br><br>I'll implement some last things like reading ping and packetloss from enet and test the whole thing intensively, then i'll possibly post the results here.<br><br>Oh, by the way, isn't anyone here interested in an enet-wrapper which is used similarly to BNet(Ex) and has optional reliable packets? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
