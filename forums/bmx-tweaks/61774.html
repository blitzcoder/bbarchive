Not to mention the fact that most of it is not very well documented...<br><br>This, however, is not the worst thing. Some things, like graphics, aren't easily handled as objects. You can make a graphics object (canvas.TGraphics = CreateGraphics... (which, imo, SHOULD be canvas.TGraphics = TGraphics.CreateGraphics)), but you can't use canvas.setAlpha or something like that; you should use a global function setAlpha.<br><br>I think this is really messy, or am I missing some point here? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Even the docs we could update ourselves but it gets overwritten next time docmods is run. <br>I've tried to code things where changing the source would make it easy but, to externalise it, would be too much hassle to bother.<br>&lt;rant off&gt; <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I like situations where both exist, like ListAddLast and the ".AddLast" method, and Len for arrays along with the ".Dimensions" method.  That way, if I'm feeling all 1980s, I can use what's in the back of my mind, or I can get all New Age and go with the OO alternative &lt;g&gt;.<br><br>I personally make my stuff very OO, so there are lots of TWhatever.Create's and TWhatever.Destroy's (however, I'm lazy, so I just directly access Fields rather than bother with writing tons of .Get's and .Set's - yes, I live on the dangerous edge).<br><br>But I get your point.  Sometimes I'll be expecting to use an OO approach (especially with MaxGUI) and there isn't one.  That's when I go "Why are there separate TextFieldText and TextAreaText functions?  Where's the '.Text' method (or '.Caption') that VB has had since forever?"  But then I calm down &lt;g&gt;.  However, I have been tempted to write my own OO extensions as mentioned above, just for completeness.  So I guess what I'm saying is, "I feel your pain." &lt;g&gt;  But ours is a happy, quixotic Basic, so I happily muddle through. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But since I also have a method named 'setAlpha', the draw-routine will call the method setAlpha (as it should, of course) but not the global function, which, at the moment, is the only way of setting the alpha. So, if you have an object with a method which has the same name as a global function, you cannot call this global function from your object.<br><br>Of course you'll tell me that I shouldn't have methods and global functions using the same name, and damn well you're right. But there shouldn't be all those global functions at all.<br><br>I understand that they are easy and nice for those new to max, and that it's still basic, but wouldn't it be nice if we just could use the Framework/Import commands to not include several modules containg those global functions? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
