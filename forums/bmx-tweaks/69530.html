BlitzLua uses the author's version of the <a href="/posts.php?topic=69429" target="_blank">axe.lua</a> module.<br><br>You may use the module to evaluate Lua scripts within your own BlitzMax application or use a precompiled executable to run stand-alone Lua scripts.<br><br>BlitzLua comes in three "flavours": a "function interface", an "object interface" and an "objective interface" - the "function interface" has been implemented and is fully usable, the remaining interfaces should come within the next two weeks.<br><br>The package should currently be considered as "pre-alpha": it has only roughly been tested, and this will not change until the "objective interface" has been fully implemented.<br><br>The full source code is available at<br><br><a href="http://www.Andreas-Rozek.de/BlitzMax/BlitzLua.zip" target="_blank">http://www.Andreas-Rozek.de/BlitzMax/BlitzLua.zip</a><br><br>After downloading the ZIP archive you should create a new folder "lua.mod" within the BlitzMax module folder (i.e. &lt;blitzmax-installation-folder&gt;/mod/lua.mod/) and unpack the archive into that directory.<br><br>If not already done, you should also download and install the author's (inofficial) version of axe.lua (see link above) - the "official" version is not sufficient!<br><br>After unpacking, please "Build Modules" and "Document Modules" from within your BlitzMax IDE. Afterwards, the module and its documentation are available.<br><br>The stand-alone executable (called BlitzLua) is available at<br><br>- Windows: <a href="http://www.Andreas-Rozek.de/BlitzMax/BlitzLua.debug.exe" target="_blank">http://www.Andreas-Rozek.de/BlitzMax/BlitzLua.debug.exe</a><br>- MacOS X: <a href="http://www.Andreas-Rozek.de/BlitzMax/BlitzLua.debug.app.zip" target="_blank">http://www.Andreas-Rozek.de/BlitzMax/BlitzLua.debug.app.zip</a><br>- Linux: <a href="http://www.Andreas-Rozek.de/BlitzMax/BlitzLua.debug" target="_blank">http://www.Andreas-Rozek.de/BlitzMax/BlitzLua.debug</a><br><br>The module documentation also contains some information about the BlitzLua executable.<br><br>Please send any questions and bug reports to the author. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Under Windows XP, MacOS X and Linux!!!!<br><br>My son would probably say "cool" - but I'm too old for that metaphor.<br><br>Indeed, BlitzMax and Lua seem to form a powerful combination! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There is no automatic interfacing mechanism (for arbitrary BlitzMax or third-party modules) since BlitzMax does not have any kind of introspection. However, it would not be difficult to write your own interfaces - it's just tedious work...<br><br>In practice, you would probably prototype your applications with Lua and then replace time-critical (or computationally expensive) parts with BlitzMax code. <br><br>Myself, I am planning a system similar to HyperCard and Smalltalk with Lua as scripting language and BlitzMax/MaxGUI for all the non-Lua features. This would include the ability to modify a "system" (i.e. program and data) at <i>runtime</i> with automatic persistence of any modifications - but don't expect anything before July. Some other stuff will come before...<br><br>The <a href="http://lua-users.org/wiki/BlitzLua" target="_blank">article about BlitzLua</a> in the Lua wiki will give you more information about the package - especially the three "flavours" of the interface: the "<i>function interface</i>", the "<i>object interface</i>" and the "<i>objective interface</i>". The first two map BlitzMax functions and objects (types) to corresponding Lua functions and "classes" - and you will need to know BlitzMax/MaxGUI (and have access to the BlitzMax/MaxGUI documentation) if you really want to use them. The third "flavour", however, only loosely resembles the BlitzMax objects and reflect, what the author would want the BlitzMax interface to look like (and also offers additional functionalities such as an automatic layout mechanism for GUI components). You won't need any BlitzMax knowledge to use the "<i>objective interface</i>"...<br><br>The package itself contains even more documentation (which I am not allowed to place on the Lua wiki) - just download the archive and either install it (if you want to try BlitzLua) or unpack it somewhere else (if you just want to safely browse the documentation)<br><br>I'm open to any kind of feedback (bug reports, wish lists, comments, etc.) but please keep in mind: you currently get a pre-alpha release - full testing will not start before the "<i>objective interface</i>" has been completely implemented (which I now plan for June, 15th) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It should perform quite well, as most of the computational stuff should be done within the 3D engines - but one never knows before having tried...<br><br>Actually, my goal will have been reached when programmers do not know (in advance) how much coding they should do in Lua and how much in BlitzMax. Or, in other words: when they may start prototyping in Lua and porting time critical aspects to BlitzMax later. This should increase everyones productivity (which is what I have in mind) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
