Hopefully I'll manage to make it fully cross-platform. (As I don't have a Mac neither I have Linux installed -but planning on doing so someday again-, any help in this point would be greatly appreciated)<br><br>For the Win version I heavily modified an opensource driver+api that is the real one doing all the dirty job.<br>It's called CPNMouse  - <a href="http://cpnmouse.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">http://cpnmouse.sourceforge.net</a><br><br>As far as I know, should work under Win2000 and WinXP (any NT will do, I guess).<br><br>My current experience is: working under 2kPro, not working under W98 and half-way on XP Pro (only driver for the ps2 mouse worked for me, USB one rejected). Still got to try with some COM mouse I have, too.<br><br>For info on issues, how to install etc please refer to BlitzMice.bmx<br><br>This mod isn't complete, of course; however I've focused it to use it as an 'add-on', I mean, as 'another' control method for a game, but never meant to be a required one.<br><br>IMPORTANT : Main mouse gets frozen while the app is running. Not only in Bmax's app but in Windows. So, Blitzmax's Mouse functions are disabled while BlitzMice is inited. Only one of both can be used at a time. Killing BlitzMice anytime makes mouse return to its 'normal' state. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
