This would make the module pretty much immediately portable to the other platforms, and would make the GUI look the same on all platforms (an advantage or disadvantage, depending on how you look at it).

The advantage here is that code would be portable and the GUI would look like a native GUI for that platform. The disadvantage is that only the features that are supported on all platforms could be used, and so special features on MacOS, for example, would have to be implemented some other way.<br><br>Using this last scenario, how do we then construct a proper event-driven application program that opens windows, creates buttons and responds to events, etc on all platforms? <br><br><b>This is one that I think needs careful thought if we want to keep BMX truly cross-platform.</b> And I, for one, do!<br><br>What are your thoughts on this?<br><br>Russell <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You can have real music in mods, in midi you cannot. Also, midi quality is determined by your sound card.  It will sound completly different on different cards.  Mods are basically midi files (ok, so completly different format but hey) that include their basic sound effects.<br><br>@Russel<br><br>This has been discussed before. And apparently implemented in different languages than blitz.  The solution is an abstraction layer between your program and the OS that works differently depending on the target OS, however you use it in the same way.  One solution is wxWindows which is a cross platform native gui lib that works on multiple platforms.  This could be directly used by BMax or Mark could mirror the method and improve.  Python lib tkinter has 3 methods, the one im most familiar with allows you to set your gadget's positions in rows/columns kinda like an html table where your elements can have row/colspans.  Then, it decides how to lay it all out and the size of the window.  My personal favorite is one that I dont think has been used before - let the user decide.  Basically, bmax will supply data about the  size of the OS's controls, and you will access this data to decide the exact method of layout.  Mark could also release a lib on top of this that automates the process, while allowing those that want it the power of direct access. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I think your scenario 2) is worth more time considering than scenario 1), but that's personal taste - I don't like the thought of BlitzMax programs being distinguishable.  I think the best solution (and I came up with this on my own, so it's likely to be a very flawed idea:), is to make one module dedicated to each platform, with platform specific code (obviously) and implementations, then a fourth 'wrapper/helper' module that tries it's best to tie them all under one umbrella.  Kinda like how Max2D works with OpenGL - it's an abstraction on top of the OpenGL module, which ultimately means you can use OpenGL code in between Max2D code.  The same thing would apply for this GUI idea, if you need more functionality than the standard helper module provides, you can go between the lines (esp if you're only coding for one platform) and use the platform specific commands as well.  After all that is done, then, and only then, would I consider a fourth 'OS' module, which implements a crossplatform 'home grown' GUI system, like your option number 1).<br><br><div class="quote"> Mods are basically midi files (ok, so completly different format but hey) that include their basic sound effects. <br></div><br>Basically the equivalent of a midi file with an attached patch file.<br><br><div class="quote"> I don't consider the 3D, GUI or music modules 'weird and wonderful' so a peek at the list would be interesting. <br></div><br>The only other rumour I have heard is that of a 'database' module, but this rumour was very vague. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
