I've also made the interfaces on TAudioSample and TPixmap more OO-esq, for folks like me who don't use the global functions much. For code clarity and maintenance I tried to make all of the global functions simple wrappers to the Type itself where applicable.<br><br>I noticed the loader factories were implemented with a simple linked list and not TList.  I assumed this was a timing issue where BRL implement the loaders before TList was done/usable.  Since TList is now available I refactored the custom linked lists to use TList, which made the code much more readable and smaller.<br><br>Some of the pub modules had to change, which I detail below.<br><br>Downloads:<br><a href="http://www.workerbee.com/downloads/brl.mod-1.0.0.zip" target="_blank">http://www.workerbee.com/downloads/brl.mod-1.0.0.zip</a><br><a href="http://www.workerbee.com/downloads/pub.mod-1.0.0.zip" target="_blank">http://www.workerbee.com/downloads/pub.mod-1.0.0.zip</a><br><br>NOTE: <br>- Make a BACKUP of your existing mods directory before trying to use these.  I've tested them but you never know what might happen.<br><br>- If you don't know much about C or dealing with possible C compiler errors/warnings then don't try to use these.<br><br>- I've not tested these on MacOS or Linux.  If someone can give them a shot I'd like to know if there are any problems.<br><br>Here is a detailed list of changes:<br><br><b>Changed Modules</b><br><br><b>BRL.AudioSample</b><br>- Added Load class method to TAudioSample.  Redefined global LoadAudioSample in terms of TAudioSample.Load.<br>- Added Save method to TAudioSample.<br>- Added TAudioSampleSaver factory and global list of registered TAudioSampleSavers called sample_savers.<br>- Changed sample_loaders to use TList instead of the custom linked list.<br>- Changed Load to use EachIn operator on TList instead of the custom linked list walk.<br>- Removed unneeded _succ Field from TAudioSampleLoader as TList replaces custom linked list functionality.<br><br><b>BRL.Font</b><br>- Changed Global _loaders to font_loaders to be consistent with other modules following similar pattern.<br>- Changed font_loaders to use TList instead of the custom linked list implementation.<br>- Added Load method to TFont and redefined global LoadFont function in terms of TFont.Load.<br>- Removed unneeded _succ Field from TFontLoader as TList replaces custom linked list functionality.<br><br><b>BRL.FreeTypeFont</b><br>- Removed Load from TFreeTypeFont subclass and moved implementation to the TFreeTypeFontLoader subclass.  This allowed the base TFont to define Load in generic terms of TFontLoaders, returning a TFont.  This implementation is consistent with the way TAudioSampleLoader/TAudioSampleSaver and TPixmapLoader/TPixmapSaver are implemented.<br><br><b>BRL.Pixmap</b><br>- Added XFlip method to TPixmap and redefined global XFlipPixmap in terms of the pixmap instance's XFlip method.<br>- Added YFlip method to TPixmap and redefined global YFlipPixmap in terms of the pixmap instance's YFlip method.<br>- Added Mask method to TPixmap and redefined global MaskPixmap in terms of the pixmap's Mask method.<br>- Added Resize method to TPixmap and redefined global ResizePixmap in terms of the pixmap's Resize method.<br>- Added Load class method to TPixmap and redefined global LoadPixmap in terms of the class method Load.<br>- Added Save method to TPixmap to use the new TPixmapSaver factory.<br>- Added Global pixmap_savers as a TList of registered TPixmapSavers.<br>- Changed Global pixmap_loaders to use TList instead of the custom linked list implementation.<br>- Changed TPixmap.Load to use EachIn operator on TList of providers instead of the custom linked list walk.<br>- Remove _succ Field from TPixmapLoader as TList provides similar functionality.<br><br><b>BRL.TGALoader</b><br>- Removed TGAHeader and constants and moved to BRL.TGACommon for reuse in TGA.TGASaver.<br><br><b>PUB.LibJPG</b><br>- Added savejpg function to loadjpg.c.  Probably should rename the C source file but I left it as-is for now.<br>- Added Extern function prototype to .bmx file.<br><br><b>PUB.LibPNG</b><br>- Added required Extern function prototypes to .bmx file.<br><br><b>New Modules</b><br><br><b>BRL.BMPSaver</b><br>- Added TPixmapSaverBMP subclass.  When this module is included in your code you'll be able to save any TPixmap as a BMP file.<br><br><b>BRL.PNGSaver</b><br>- Added TPixmapSaverPNG subclass.  When this module is included in your code you'll be able to save any TPixmap as a PNG file.<br><br><b>BRL.JPGSaver</b><br>- Added TPixmapSaverJPG subclass.  When this module is included in your code you'll be able to save any TPixmap as a JPG file.<br><br><b>BRL.TGASaver</b><br>- Added TPixmapSaverTGA subclass.  When this module is included in your code you'll be able to save any TPixmap as a TGA file.<br>- NOTE: The TGA saving support is currently weak.  TGA's are written in pure PF_RGB888 format without any RLE compression. 8, 15, and 16-bit formats aren't currently supported either.<br><br><b>BRL.WAVSaver</b><br>- Added TAudioSampleSaverWAV subclass.  When this module is included in your code you'll be able to save any TAudioSample as a WAV file.<br><br><b>BRL.TGACommon</b><br>- Common module for TGAHeader and constant defintions. BRL.TGALoader and BRL.TGASaver use this module.<br><br><b>Examples</b><br>Here's an example of loading and saving a TPixmap in a variety of formats:<br><br><textarea class=codebox name="code" wrap=OFF readonly="true" rows="15" cols="80">

Local pixmap:TPixmap = TPixmap.Load( "c:\temp\test.bmp" )

This is a compiler detail but, from what I can see, should be fairly easy to implement.  The basic jist is that you can define the same type in many files and the compiler merges them together before compiling.  This allow the programmer to spread code across multiple files for easier reading.<br><br>If your concern is having the methods on TPixmap, I'd wonder why you even bothered with OO in the first place.  The beauty of OO is that you have a "thing" (noun) and you can ask it to do stuff for you.  The messages (verbs) you can send to an object should relate to what that object (noun) is.  It seems very natural to me that I'd ask a TPixmap to YFlip, Resize, Mask, or Save itself. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Backup my changes to the BRL.pixmap mod.<br>2. Run syncmods.  We'll assume an update to BRL.pixmap is downloaded.<br>3. Now I have to merge my changes back into BRL.pixmap from the backup.<br><br>We need a mods search directory feature on bmk.  This would accept a colon separated list of paths for mods.  Once bmk finds a particular mod along the search path it stops looking.  This way I could copy BRL.pixmap into a custom-mods directory, make our changes and be safe when I run syncmods, which would always update the main mods directory.<br><br>When we're ready we could merge in updates from BRL into our custom-mods.  The difference here is that we wouldn't be <i>forced</i> to accept the changes every time.<br><br>In effect this is a "poor mans branch".

It'd be cool if when it compiles modules it would also take all the functions, types, and variables, compile into .a files, with each one importing all the ones they rely on.  Then, if you run the compiler in "Ultimate Release" mode it will figure out which variables, types, and functions its using, and then import those specific files.  You could also have "Super Ultimate Mode", which would take it even further, and take out all the unused methods and fields in classes, generate the source file, and compile that.

Windows would be completely unbareable if Intel\AMD had not increased their efficiency and speed at almost exponential rates. Run Windows XP on a 90mhz Pentium with 64MB to see what I mean...
