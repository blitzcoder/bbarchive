Hopefully.  So what if you wanted the inner with to refer to a separate instance of Instance2, not  Instance1.instance2.  I suppose you could have With .instance2 to make it process it as instance1.instance2 and leave off the period to make it process Instance1 and Instance2 separately?  Sounds like a plan...<br><br>Not sure that having context determined by a period is a good idea from a readability standpoint though. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It removes the overhead. It has to be optimizing otherwise there is no benefit at execution time. So that's why it cannot be any kind of preprocessor thing. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This feature is part of them. Because a preprocessor would have to actually mimic a fair part of the compiler's work.<br>Indeed, given that we wouldn't specify anymore the variable we're acting on, the proprocessor - to handle the "With" feature - would need to know a LOT of contextual information:<br>- local variables in the function/method<br>- global variables in the WHOLE program (including the ones imported from other modules)<br>- the fields of any type  in the WHOLE program (including the ones imported from other modules) so that when "with" is used inside a method the preprocessor can retrieve the fields of type of the current type AND its potential base type(s), and determine if it's a field that is accessed.<br><br>So indeed, I personally think it's asking a lot to a preprocessor.<br>But then to ask such a feature to the compiler, it has to fit in what the creator(s) (here Mark) envision to be best for the language. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The point of "With" is precisely to avoid explicitely giving the name of the variable you're acting upon. And you can't just put a "Local Instance:? = ?" at the top, because then "Instance" would  hide any other variable of that same name in outer scopes. It has to be determined on a case by case basis when you're implicitely refering to the "Instance" of the With declaraiont, or to another one. That is, emulate what the compiler already know in order to stick another resolution rule (for "With") in the process. That's like with "Self" you know: when you're in a method and do "Hello=True", the compiler looks for "Hello" in the parameter's list. If not found it looks in the outer scope : the current type and its base types (or said differently, in the type of the implicit "Self" variable). And if not found yet, it then looks in the global scope. Making "with" work means adding a rule to look in the type of "Instance" before anything else. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

When you do Player1.x=1 it will think, ok, this is a new instance, go figure out where the instance is and then relatively jump to the Player1 field and set it to 1. Then it'll see the next line, Player1.y=1 as an entirely new command unrelated to the previous one, will AGAIN go and look up the instance and jump to the Y field relatively.<br><br>Then again, I suppose if you put Player1 into a local variable, all it would be doing is an indirect addressing, as for pointers e.g. Player1[xoffset]=1. After all it is only pointer manipulation. The thing is that a `With` would take your instance which is not likely to be in a Local variable if you have lots of them, and could be stored in some linked list in memory, and puts it into a local variable while you're planning to access it. I suppose really this is only to help with writing the program and not to do with compiling it.<br><br>That said, for example, if you use an array it has to go to the array object then jump to the memory where the data is stored and then jump to the offset. If you did:<br><br><pre class=code>
With MyArray
    [15]=4
    [12]=10
    [41]=1
EndWith
</pre><br>surely it could then keep the handle of the memory where the data is stored, in an internal local variable, and use that for indirectly addressing the array elements. You would not be able to simulate that with a preprocessor unless you directly go into the array object, extract the memory pointer and do pointer access.<br><br>The same would apply to, like, a TPixmap. MyPixmap:TPixmap is not a pointer to memory containing a pixmap image, it's a pointer to a TPixmap type instance which contains a pointer to memory which contains an image. So if you did...<br><pre class=code>
With MyPixmap
    LoadPixmap(url) ' no need to specify which pixmap object
    RGBA=ReadPixel(x,y) 'no need to say in which pixmap
EndWith
</pre><br>or with a bank...<br><pre class=code>
With MyBank
    With BankPtr
        [12]=$FF00FFEE
        [16]=$FFEEFF00
    EndWith    
EndWith
</pre><br>It can keep the pointer to the TBank object internally rather than having to specify it every time you want to change contents. Then it can keep the memory pointer in an internal local (you could do this part yourself), and then you're just left with having to write what offsets contain what data.<br><br>Apart from readability and ease of programming I do think there would be speed benefits. Accessing a block of memory with direct pointer access is faster than accessing an array or a bank simply because each time to access them you have to jump via the type before you get to the memory space. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
