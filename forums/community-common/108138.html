For those of you that don't know, they're often like interactive stories, barely games, but in a way kind of fun experiences where you don't need to worry about dying and due to the current age of graphics, it really almost is like you're going out on a trip, except not leaving your house.<br><br>Then it kind of occured to me, that the games we were playing, despite them being so realistic in either graphic fidelity or storyline, none of them were set in present day. Gone Home (1995), Gone To the Rapture (1982), FireWatch (1989 or so), Virginia (1990s)<br><br>At first I don't know what it was, the feelings I was having. but I think I might have figured it out, the future, the present we are in now. 2017, it's just boring, crappy and a bleak future all round. The past however, or the science fiction future, that's what is interesting.<br><br>Way back in 1995, I discovered the Internet, and it felt like my eyes had been opened, so much opportunity for learning, discovering new things, new ideas, meeting (talking) to people.<br><br>Fast forward over 20 years and in some ways it feels it's becoming a bad thing for mankind, as a whole. Whether it's the Internet, or listening to music. Having constant contact with the Internet via a mobile phone.<br><br>Think of things like X-Files, or detective series, those sorts of programmes can't easily be made anymore. Think of a story, or some kidnapping disaster, or anything. People would just google it, or seek help using their mobiles. It's difficult to create stories and ideas now because the Internet has quite literally killed off certain types of entertainment. Why would anyone create a skit show with 2 comedy guys when you can just spend all day watching cute animals fall over on youtube, now and for free.<br><br>It's not a surprise that games, TVs and movies, all in general are set in the past, the future or fantasy landscapes. So much stuff created when I was young, it just wouldn't be popular now.<br><br>Fashion, music, and a lot of tech such as cars. There doesn't seem to be all that much advancement, and regards NASA and space, we've barely made any progress. <br><br>I sat yesterday, watching NASA Live - Earth From Space on youtube and was just in awe, that there's a live stream from outerspace for 20 mins I just sat there mesmerised, and when I looked at the live chat, people just complaining how dull it was. Just makes me sad, if that existed in 1990 when I was growing up, it would be pretty much the most amazing thing on TV.<br><br>Here in Japan, almost 90% of people on the trains in Tokyo, everyone looking down at their iPhones or Androids. At the weekend me and my wife went shopping and when crossing a bridge we watched a couple with their 4 year old daughter who was excited and mesmerised at the train going past, the parents however were both seperately looking at their phones and missed all of it. We're so connected that we don't seem to connect anymore to people right next to us. Why bother learning stuff when jobs change so fast, why bother when you can just google everything.<br><br>Not saying this affects everyone, but I sometimes worry for the future of mankind, everyone is just consuming content, now and all the time. And these entitled millenials, the special snowflake generation, don't even get me started on that. My grandparents were always obsessed and mad at me for spending many sunny days in my room on my Amiga and yet I feel like the person who is least addicted to this modern wave of technology.<br><br>I remember in the 90s, life had so many hours of tedium. Me and my friends spent hours skateboarding and doing flying kicks off my parents garden wall trying to pretend we playing Double Dragon in the arcades. Kids these days have it so easy, but on the flipside, they are never apart from entertainment.<br>They will problem never sit and dream about space while listening to Jean Michel Jarre, and dream about doing awesome things when they grow up. So many people are just lost on the Internet, arguing on Twitter, social justice warriors on both sides, just fighting on social media endlessly. Literally never ending content appearing on youtube hourly. Free games everywhere.<br><br>Maybe I'm just getting old, just feels like sometimes the world really is getting shitter. I'd love to go back in time, before the Internet was normality. I've almost forgotten what life used to be like back then. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

They are less but still exist.<br><br>I just saw some stats from some market research the company I work for did. One of those figures was percentage of people without a television.  There was a healthy but small percentage of such people who mostly were highly educated.  So I'd assume on that basis (could be wrong) that there is a similar small percentage of highly educated people who still enjoy creative and high quality pursuits.<br><br>Yes...if you read youtube comments you will think the world has turned into idiocracy.<br><br>And for the most part these people have always existed. The difference is with the internet they have a global voice.<br><br>For example....nyan cat on youtube...100 million views of something that is absolutely stupid. Makes me think the human race are a bunch of dumb idiots. And for the most part - that is true.<br><br>When it comes to making games something I have to remember sometimes is that unfortunately most of our users fit that description too.  Most of them, not all, are not interested in anything with a layer of complexity or difficulty to it.<br><br>The world is not getting shittier it is just the uneducated are finding their voice through the internet....and the media is pandering to them to sell as much to the most. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
