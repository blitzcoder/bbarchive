But sooner or later, you'll start seeing monitors as well since it is pretty much the future.<br><br><div class="quote"> what you guys thinks about TV OLED for computer use? <br></div><br><br>Probably fine, albeit with a few caveats:<br>- Many modern TV's have a bunch of magic intended to make the TV signal look 'better' , where it does image interpolation and calculate in-between frames etc. While mostly fine for 24FPS TV shows, but can look like ass with a 60+fps computer feed. SOME TV's allow you to disable those features for SOME of the input ports <br>- On top of that: some of the TV's image proccessing chips that are supposed to improved the image, add a few frame delay. Fine when you're watching TV, but not so good when you are playing a fast or competitive game.<br>- Many TV's have an overscan mode, where it doesn't map the input pixels 1:1 to their screen locations, but apply an overscan mask since that is how older CRTs used to show the image. If you hook up a computer, it may automatically go into overscan mode which can cause the outer edge of your computer image to disappear outside the visible part of the screen, which can include your entire windows task bar. (Some video card drivers allow you to apply an overscan correction to account for those lost pixels)<br>- Some TV's only support a limited # of resolutions -- you're probably fine with 1920x1080 and 1280x720  (1080p and 720p), but not all TV's will handle lower resolutions, e.g. older games that try to run at 1024x768 or 800x600 may not be supported at all when you use a TV for a monitor.<br><br>For all of these features and 'enhancements', make sure to read the manual to verify that you can DISABLE them. If you can, and it supports more than just the standard HDTV resolutions, then you're probably OK using it as a monitor. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

One of the major drawbacks of an OLED display is image retention (burn-in). In an OLED display each pixel is driven independently and each pixel ages differently - the brightness is reduced with use. To put it simply - a pixel that was used a lot will be less bright than a pixel that hasn't been driven as much.<br><br>For mobile phones and TVs this is less of a problem - but in a computer user interface many UI elements are quite fixed (toolbars, icons, etc) which means that burn-in is a real problem. There are some technologies to handle this problem - for example by measurement and compensation, and the lifetime of OLED displays is improving all the time. In addition user-interface designers can design a user interface that will be more suited for OLED displays. <br></div><br><br>So... Seems like with the current tech, you may not want to fork over a crapton of money for an OLED screen just yet... (Even when using an OLED TV, you will still run into the same burn-in issue when using it as a monitor) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
