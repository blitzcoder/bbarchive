As you say, it's hard to find accurate information on a lot of stuff these days as data is starting to be backed by industry. If it's in your interest you'll fight it. TV isn't going to admit it's dying, if they do, it's just going to accelerate their demise, the way they're behaving now isn't exactly helping though.<br><br>It's ironic because over the years, everyone wages has got lower, you've had to work for less. But now it's affecting them as well, their revenue is also dropping and their reaction is to try to hold onto a monopoly which of course has been slowly slipping away from them in years.

As a result of that, if you import mass immigration of uneducated people, integrating them into your society on mass is not only problematic but practically impossible.<br><br><div class="quote"> <br>can you name any world class universities operating in a predominately Muslim country? <br> <br></div><br><br>That's not true though since Muslims living in west countries are obviously more successful, again in what I just said, though it's because they're living in lands with opportunity. There are obviously not going to be high class educations such as Universities in a Muslim country. Of all us here were born in Iraq instead of our current country. I can guaranteed none of us would be blitz programmers, even if we are just as intelligent or like minded as we are now. It's not about race or colour, never was. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
