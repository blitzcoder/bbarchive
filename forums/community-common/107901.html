As it was so overpowering I stepped off to find nothing there. Naturally I stepped right up and continued my need for speed, racing down the other side of the slope, 10 sec later I almost crashed into them..(I was only 12 years old and bit shaken up after)<br><br>Also had many occasions in my old house such as watching a movie on tv, thinking about a certain person, phrase, text or song, switching channels and whoops there it is. Now that I would categorize as a coincidence, but not when happens 3 times in a row! And that happend many times, gave me the creeps. I tried to find many explanations such as super hearing(perhaps the neighbors watching something I'd picked up?) But also happend at places where there was not such a possibility and also was with text on TV, so nothing audible.<br><br>2 weeks ago I was talking to a colleague about the movie 'Fallen' and started  humming the Rolling Stone's song in that movie, phone rang, I picked up and customer has it playing quite loud in the background, exactly where I stopped, saying: "Pleased to meet you, hope you've guessed my name!"<br><br><b>... of you have had precognitive dreams, which came as such later (in time).</b><br>Many, many times. Like things half a year up to 2 years ahead. Can't do anything with it though, so kinda useless.<br><br><b>... of you are able to astral project ?</b><br>Not sure..<br><br><b>... are seeing the numbers like 1:11, 444, 555 (its more like noticing than seeing)</b> <br>1:11 /2:22/ 5:55 All the time on the digital clocks, sometimes worse than other times. Like wake up middle of night and look at the clock, tadaa! There it is again. And last week at work an email received at 13:13:13 &lt;- my colleague was stun. Also lot's of customer phone numbers containing an undesirable combo I will not mention. Of course all these things can just be coincidences, but I've come across too many 'coincidentals' in my time along with some other unusual incidents, so I kinda stopped believing in that. Usually it's a sign something nogood is on it's way(like as if a warning or laugh in your face if you will).<br><br><b>... hearing a voice which is not their own, but telling the truth, always ?</b><br>At work few years back had couple of times that when I was, shame on me, falling asleep and was woken by a wisper in my ear calling my name softly but very close up, while no one around/all busy at a distance(pretty weird).<br><br><b>... of you have a Guide (unseen), which is telling you what to do and how to do? (read guiding you to the best results. or even what seemed bad turned out to be good )</b><br>I found multiple times that things appear to have been a setup in advance, many years ahead, only to come to a climax where all pieces suddenly fitted.<br><br><b>... of you believe that God creates Perfection ?</b><br>The Universe is so massively great and fantastically small - that must be perfection. Humans are perfect because of their imperfections, which may sound contradicting, but things can't be all light/white, for how would one distinguish anything? There always needs to be dark/black, for contrast. What is a white sheet without text or pictures?<br><br><b>... of you still believe that God creates Perfection even if personal experience was not so pleasant ?</b><br>See above.<br><br><b>... of you understand that almost everything in this world opposes God ?</b><br>Not really. Lots of things seen in the long term could be regarded as a vessel or tool for getting things across. Like the Romans where a plaque and blessing to people for they came with lots of violence, horrific things and taxes(:-), but also civilized thingies such as central heating, highways, schools and in the end Christianity(in which name a lot of bad has been done) but is like it or not the foundation/environment of the Western world that helped it grow to what it is technologically today. The pain and lives of the individual people mean little(and a lot at the same time, paradoxical) in the greater picture of the vastness of the universe, started and managed by an eternal being.<br><br>Similar as we would crush ants while walking round for building a hospital, which to that ant is the end of the world, while the hospital is there for a greater good. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

When I was young one of my closest friends belonged to a fundamentalist Christian sect. In his basement there was a poster depicting the history of the world, all six thousand years of it. Our conflicting beliefs never caused any problems between us. He once invited me to go to church with his family. I said no thank you. In all the years I knew him that was the totality of our religious conversation. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This is wrong.<br><br>But someone might say, "if you get to pass your values to your kids then I get to pass my religious values to my kids".<br>But you're not "passing values" after all, are you?

They will never let go of the possibility of indoctrinating children because they know that this is what gets them the best followers. The kind of people that, as adults, might have scientific scrutiny for some things, but when it comes to their religion their childhood conditioning takes over.<br>Dear adult religious person, the way you look at other religions ("yeah thanks, but no thanks") is the same way you'd be looking at your own religion right now if you hadn't been forced to take it when young.<br><br>In a world where all religions say "this is the One True Religion.

We are a part of that whole single entity. Which in turn, means it only makes sense that there are connections between all parts of that entity and therefore between each and every one of us. We are connected together and we are connected to everything else in our existence. I feel we have the lost the ability to understand the emotions and thoughts in a way to process and understand any messages from our surroundings ( or maybe we didn't lose it but are just discovering it? ) but if you stop, look, listen, feel and embrace then you do certainly realise that more is going on that meets the eye.<br><br>Your analogy of a man getting a broken leg to then be given a better life sounds a little harsh if you are going to contribute that to a god. Who says that there is a ticketed, merit system? Are you suggesting that getting a broken leg is the price for a better life? What is wrong with a better life without having to 'pay' for it in some way.<br><br>On that note yes, you can start to 'learn' by 'asking' the universe for things. I've done it many times and it works very well and I'm getting better at it with practice, however it had nothing to do with a 'god'. I've also ventured into telepathy with incredible results. It is US doing these things without the intervention of an all higher entity. WE have the ability for psychokinesis, telepathy plus all of the other 'mysterious' things that can so easily be attributed to something else. WE should wake up and take responsibility of it, grab it, learn it, harness it and nurture it - and not give the credit to anything or anyone else. That credit is ours for ourselves and we should embrace it with open arms. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Similar as people with an addiction rather have others having the same thing, so they don't have to be confronted with they're own shortcomings and don't need to doubt or think  about the situation or themselves, no need to change(which is scary).<br><br>I always thought about people who are believers that they are really just pathetic hopers/dreamers, as they don't really know for sure. I compared it with like when hanging on a cliff by one hand. Nearly everybody in that situation would start to pray out of shear desperation, just in case help may come. So that's not real faith to me and not based on something I would call logic. <br><br><br>Nevertheless.. <br><br>Let me just say I've experienced some things apart from the small things I've mentioned, that I'm not that willing to share here (for my own and anyone else's sake) that cannot really be explained by pure logic, nor would people just believe it unless witnessed, as some people near me at the time did too. I suffice in saying that I approached things very scientifically and did what a logic non-believer would do when one wants to dis- or prove that something else/higher exist besides pure coincidence of being. Of course saying this raises either curiosity or will be deemed as bluff, fantasy or lots of BS, which it isn't.<br><br>If someone gets what I'm saying here I must say I strongly discourage the approach I've taken, but I also cannot be totally silent about my findings as it turned me into a 'knower', not a 'believer' and I might be forsaking a duty perhaps.

The figure moved away and I was able to get up..going through the house I found the front door wide open! (I had recently been reading a book detailing "men in black" type experiences...)<br>Another occasion- I had gone to pick up a girlfriend at her home- we were going out to gather things for a party that night..While Kari was getting ready, I sat at the kitchen table- her Mom was in the kitchen with a older guy waiting to take her out. So this fellow talked with me a bit and then said "let me show you something". He pulled out his wallet and took out a number of color photos, laid them on the table-, he told me he was working the fishing boats along the Alaska Inland passage, his boat and another were sailing back to port late afternoon-and a very strange event occurred. He said an large object came down from the sky and hovered and moved over the water between the two ships. The photos showed a silvery disc like craft with a disturbed water effect underneath. There were photos showing the craft at various heights above the water and distances between his fishing boat and the one following them. The scale of the disc was around 30-40 feet across (10 meters) based on the width of the fishing boats. You could see other crewman watching from the stern of his boat and the bow of the one following his boat. After several minutes the craft flew off at high speed ... His demeanor was serious and I did not think it was some elaborate prank or faked photos. I have never seen those photos in any book or website since then (1977). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Because I don't fancy the idea of just ceasing to exist one fine morning but at the same time my mind won't allow me to just settle for any old comforting fairy tale. I think what I've concluded so far is something along the lines of col's take on it; that we're all part of the same universe, and that the way we see ourselves as separate entities is an illusion. <br><br>I don't buy into religious dogma, and that includes science :P Science as a method for understanding the world is sensible but limited, because humans themselves are limited. Both in terms of what they have the capacity to investigate and in what they have the capacity to comprehend. Like Noam Chomsky once said (paraphrased), "Take physics, the big star of the sciences. Physicists don't know what 90% percent of the universe is. They postulate it, because that's the only way they can make their calculations work, but they have no idea what it is or any way to prove that it even exists. That's a pretty big problem." Science is theory. You could even argue that religion is a kind of proto-science. A burly man with a hammer in the sky that creates all them thunder storms? Sure, that'll work as a theory until something better comes along.<br><br>So, I don't prescribe to any particular belief and I don't believe that everything is just random either. For my part I'm baffled by the fact that I even exist. If my own conception had gone down a bit earlier or later in the evening then half of me would been a different person, and if my parents had offset their procreational activities by a month I wouldn't exist at all. In my mind that makes my own existence a pretty big f'ing coincidence if you factor in the billions of years with all its other random occurrences leading up to that point. <br><br>In any case I'll probably keep on pondering this until the day I croak, and that's fine by me :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

How many of you have had so called Spiritual awakening ?<br><br>Several. I have experienced God. God is real. I have not had the 'final' awakening yet., still working on it<br><br>... of you have experienced some kind of reality glitches ?<br>The physical universe is a dream, an illusion, and is structured as a hologram. For the most part it does not seem to be a hologram because there is very little evidence that "the all is in every part" i.e. that something can be in more than one place at once. However, there are small glitches in the illusion of consistency, such as quantum entanglement (particles can 'share' over enormous distances with no time delay) or that a particle can be in more than one place or state at a time. These defy the notion that the physical world is objectively real. It's a holographic illusion, and everything in it is actually symbolic.<br><br>... of you have had precognitive dreams, which came as such later (in time).<br>Actually no precognition. But I've been visited by dead people who I described to someone who knew them and had never seen a picture of the person, and they looked exactly how I described. Also I've had visits with various aliens, including a blue one which housed me and my wife as a combined single personality. He was from another dimension. As far as you can say the physical world is reality, aliens are definitely real.<br><br>... of you are able to astral project ?<br>Tried many times years ago, did not really succeed. I had a partial one. I've had lucid dreams where you know you are dreaming and can do miraculous stuff, like putting your hand through objects and using telekinesis and other stuff.<br><br>... are seeing the numbers like 1:11, 444, 555 (its more like noticing than seeing) <br>These can be synchronicities or signs. 11:11 is a popular one that many people experience.<br><br>... hearing a voice which is not their own, but telling the truth, always ?<br>I am a medium and chandler and talk to Jesus, God, Holy Spirit, angels, dead people and other guides on a daily basis. I experience them as voices and also as personality sensations, feelings, and visions. The guidance I receive relating to my spiritual path and daily living is usually far more truth-filled and profound than my little ego is willing to actually accept or trust half the time. When I do trust it it is for the best. Many people would call hearing voices symptomatic of insanity. They should question why they hear their own voice.<br><br>... of you have a Guide (unseen), which is telling you what to do and how to do?<br>(read guiding you to the best results. or even what seemed bad turned out to be good )<br>Yes in particular Holy Spirit is the "voice for God" and speaks to me all through the day guiding me about what is true/false and what to do. His guidance is always perfect and loving and patient.<br><br>... of you believe that God creates Perfection ?<br>God is love and nothing else and is incapable of creating anything other than perfect love. I have had an experience of God and experiences are profoundly educational, more than any intellectual conjecture or beliefs. Because God can only create perfection, God did not create the physical universe. This universe is not objective reality. It is an illusion and almost everyone is deceived by it because they are semi-unconscious. Atheists somewhat have a point that God could not have created this world, given the atrocities that happen. Either God made the world and therefore God is hateful and vengeful and insane, or God did not make the world and God is love. The truth is the latter, and it leaves the question, who made the world? You.<br><br>... of you still believe that God creates Perfection even if personal experience was not so pleasant ?<br>People's egos create hell. The physical universe is hell. Separation from God is hell. People come here to suffer and be sick and die. This universe has no redeeming qualities other than to use it to help you to awaken to reality. This is not reality.<br><br>... of you understand that almost everything in this world opposes God ?<br>Yes this entire universe was made to oppose God, to shut God out, to make it seem like God does not exist, to attempt to destroy Him and to murder His creation (you). The physical world is an exercise in separation and death. It is a belief in mortality, even though secretly you are immortal. In every way it is designed to obfuscate (programming term ;-) God and make Him seem unobvious. This is why many people don't believe He exists. That was the point. People are heavily, heavily deceived by the illusion that this world is reality. It takes a lot of awakening and questioning and spiritual growth to come to realize a deeper truth that a) God did not make this world, b) God is the only author of reality, c) therefore this world is not reality.<br><br>If you want the answers to everything, study A Course in Miracles. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Number 4 relates to the Archangels. Number 2 relates to duality and finding balance, partnership and relationships, diplomacy and adaptability, sensitivity and selflessness. Number 2 also resonates with faith and trust and serving your life purpose and soul mission. Number 7 resonates with determination and persistence of purpose, faith and spirituality, inner-strength and inner-wisdom, spiritual awakening and development, empathic and psychic abilities.

So i would really avoid to answer this question, on the other hand, there is still missing understanding.<br><br>You see, you need to return Love, which is now focused on the material things  (material means here including People as Bodies), to God. <br><br>But obviously, there is a misunderstanding of which you we are talking about. <br><br>So to build up the story from the beginning, and ill use few of the references with the bible (using biblehub.com):<br><br>"God is a Creator of perfection" - that is a fact. <br>"God is creator of everything Good" - that is as well fact. - "God saw all that he had made, and it was very good."<br>"God is a Ruler" - this is as well true. But not in a sense which you think about rulers. He is everything, literally, that is. He made the rules. Beside of it, he does not have an Ego - which is what is threatening you in what you have experienced of the worldly rulers.  <br><br>Being everything: He is. Where he is not, is nothing.  (this line is for your understanding as body)<br><br>God is, obviously omnipotent. being able to create realities.<br>God is, obviously, a Creator. If everything, that he creates is Good. Then the logical conclusion is, that this means that he is not destroyer.<br><br>He said that only his rules should be followed. His rules are Life, Love, Happiness and Freedom. (probably 1 or 2 more, but these i could identify yet). Yet you may try every fruit from the Garden. (this means he gave you a free will to chose and try out). But he is alpha and omega (Beginning and the End) - which means, whatever you do, you will return to him because you can not be without him. This is not understandable as in the Body thinking)<br><br>So if God is Omnipotent, and he created You, then you should be omnipotent too. (as he created you in his image)<br><br>And yet, you are now walking in the Body, seeing death where life should be. Seeing sadness where Joy should be.<br><br>So what has happened ? <br><br>Obviously, you have tried few of the things out. You,(in this line), is referred to the Spiritual you. <br>And now you (bodies) are living in this world, not knowing of your Source.  <br>Obviously the spiritual you made idols. "Have no idols ..."<br><br>And it should be obvious, that there is something, that is preventing you to remember. I't does not have any real power, but it comes as with much distraction, that you do not look where you should.<br>And unless you do not know, you wont look there)<br><br>And God, could not enter Material world, because it is impossible. (there is actually no material world, but this you can not know until you are 100% spirit, or at least if you have experienced the Spiritual as far enough to understand it)<br>And even the spiritual you could not enter the material world, so a split of yourself occurred.<br><br>It is not that this has happened long time ago. (God being omnipotent does not depend on time). The decision maker of your self is still making this small error now, by believing this world is real.<br>And while God could give it (the earth) eternal life, you'r decision was to not share this world with Him. That's why you see decaying, sadness, loss etc. (this is for the spiritual you, he will understand)<br><br>...<br><br><br>As i said it's not up to me to build your beliefs. For your beliefs are built up by you, and they rule your world instead of God. <br><br>All the hate (if you encounter hatefull thoughts/behavior) which you may have now is there, only, to Prevent you from Starting looking where you should. (For God is Love, and what is the Opposite of it ?)<br><br>I'm not suggesting you to go to Churches or Sects, but at least you should start searching for yourself (your real self (God)), so that this world becomes heaven on earth.<br>I have opened <a href="/posts.php?topic=107944" target="_blank"> this </a> and <a href="/posts.php?topic=107962" target="_blank"> this </a> thread as further hints on where you should look. <br>The rest is, up to you. You have the free will of chosing. And you do see that wars are not constructive. (only from the viewpoint of some earthlings, but that is rather madness, then)<br><br><br>Hint: Start thinking as an Omnipotent God. <br>(this is for your Mind while still in body, to train yourself to think constructive and to enable you to, at least for a second, give power to God)<br><br>For example: What would an Omnipotent being do if the earth becomes overpopulated ? <br>(he is creator, solver of all problems, and has unlimited resources)<br><br>One of invalid solution would be to 'kill'. God is life and creator of life, and life does not destroy life. (creation is the Rule of God)<br><br>One of valid solution would be to make the earth bigger in size. (this he can do immediately without you even noticing it. nor would you be able to prove it))<br><br>For if there is a Problem, there must be a solution to it. And if you are Programmer, then you are Creative enough to find solutions. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
