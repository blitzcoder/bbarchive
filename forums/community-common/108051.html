You can't please everyone all the time.<br><br>Some people demand a super-immersive game takes a very long time to play and finish, while others prefer something that you can play for very short bursts.<br><br>Some people want a game that slowly ramps up difficulty levels over extended gameplay, while others want to be thrown straight into the action.<br><br>Some people like the whole leveling up and grinding, while others want to get rid of all the 'busywork'<br><br>Some people love open-ended world concepts, while others rather have a more limited exposure to the game world but have the 'director' steer them towards the parts that are actually relevant to the gameplay instead of wandering around in irrelevant scenery. Neither is inherently wrong of course, but many people will feel like the other approach is.<br><br>Sometimes programmers may try something new and have a type of gameplay that doesn't quite work out, or is not optimal. They can either scrap the whole thing and forget it ever happens, or they may end up finishing it anyway and trying to sell it to at least recoup some of their investments.<br><br>And yes, there are a lot of games that are a bit rough around the edges with certain things that could be polished a bit more or &lt;whatever&gt;, but in the end the creators do have to make a decision to actually SHIP. It's diminishing returns: if we spend a few more months polishing this game it will undoubtedly look better, but they may end up spending an extra $200,000 in salaries for the programmers/art people/whatever, which is a HUGE cost if that extra polishing would result in a dozen extra sales. At some point the game becomes "good enough", and it is just that -- good enough.<br><br>It's a bit of a catch-22 of course -- but when you think about it, it's hardly surprising. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Those are the people that actually give them real life money, that's what keeps the lights on, and that's what made the founders billionaires. Everything they do is aimed at keeping those actual customers (the advertisers) happy. If they can please you along the way they might, but in the end all they have to do is keep the advertisers happy, as long as they don't lose too many facebookers along the way.<br><br>and keep in mind: this does not just apply to facebook, this applies to ALL 'free' internet websites. Google. Youtube. Bing. Myspace. Blogspot. Yahoo mail. etc.<br>Their features and navigation is greatly optimized to make them advertiser money, NOT to make your life easier. It's just a bonus if those two separate goals happen to align from time to time.<br><br>Some seemingly un-optimized extra navigation clicks = more opportunities to show you ads. An un-optimized timeline = more opportunities to show you ads. Some 'odd' seemingly unrelated recommendations = more opportunities to show you ads. And if they don't show you ads, then your response and reaction to the choices they presented you with allow them to learn more about human behavior and you behavior in particular, which means that they learn more and more about their demographics which in turn they can cash in by picking 'better' ads to lead to more click-throughs and sales and thereby more kickbacks/profit.<br><br>So..  How does &lt;some&gt; choice benefit either the advertisers or your alien benefactors' interests, because they sure as hell aren't giving things away to do you a personal favor.  A lot of odd choices will make a lot more sense if you look at it from that perspective. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
