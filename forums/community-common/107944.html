BUT they are 'live' only if they are 'stimulated' (new connections required with other neurons, memory exercises or movements).<br>Otherwise (excluding neuron illness) they are destined to die.<br>We stop to produce new neurons (in general) at the birth: what we have is what we can use (and some people doesn't use at all!!! ).<br><br>Memory: there's nothing more ephemeral than human memory! Excluding some exceptions, like some form of autism, memory (=neural connections) can change/be destroyed/removed. None remembers early days of our brith; none remember *everything* he/she did (so 'total knowledge, skills, abilities etc' are not 'accumulated'... are just transient when not used!), our memories tend to change: we like to fade-out some things or focus on other, so 'common facts' are different from person to person.<br><br>So, technically, 'I' is something in a a certain 'time-point'. We are not even living in 'present'!, as there's a - technical/physiological time gap from external events (an image, a sound, a touch) and the interpretation/registration of if: we live in a world delayed of about 20/25 ms...<br><br>What represent you?
