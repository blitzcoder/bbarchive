I had delusions and paranoid thoughts.  Since that time my mind has improved, I'm working full time and living a productive and quality life (lots of good things).<br><br>However....<br><br>Since that time my outlook on the world has shifted.  I see the world through a different lens now.  While the delusional paranoia has left me I can't help but look at things that go on in my world and try and read meaning into them.<br><br>The 'plain ordinary world' around me is supposedly normal, natural, mundane and plain. But there are little events and occurrences in my life and around me that suggest hints of things not being mundane and plain.  It is hard to describe.<br><br>My mind is sane but now I often come to a point where I'm trying to analyse the world around me and explain what I see. I see things that make no sense to me, that I cannot guess the rationale for and am left with questions.<br><br>How does this relate to gaming?<br><br>Well....my app making efforts tie in with this quite directly.<br><br>Part of my paranoid thinking is thinking that people are conspiring against me. I no longer feel that way but there are things that often have the appearance of conspiracy even though there is none supposedly.<br><br>Re my app making:<br><br>I've written a lot of games, a lot of games.  None of them have been successful - and that is okay, I'm not expecting success.<br><br>But for example - if we take the most recent game I wrote (Blades and Beasts Fantasy RPG) as an example of something fairly typical of my experience - and how I'm trying to understand what is going on.<br><br>I released it on the 26th of May, 3 or 4 days ago.<br><br>It had 1 download by an old friend (paid download of $1).  My metrics tells me that he never actually played it.  Unusual. <br><br>I posted promo codes to download it for free, here and elsewhere so that people could at least try it without paying for it.  Not one of them was used.<br><br>I've advertised on google with AdWords - 100k impressions, 3k clicks and not one download.  I've advertised in the past on Google and if I advertise free apps I get consistent downloads, but if I advertise a paid app I get absolutely zero no matter how much money I spend - suggests that google is not really advertising my app but is just making up numbers that look real.<br><br>If you look at my other thread my app appears in the middle of the search results about 10 pages down amongst a host of other completely unrelated crap - 'Live Horse Wallpaper' .. how the f*** is that like my app? Redneck Toss??Big Truck Driving or whatever..<br><br>Now - I'm not complaining about not having lots of downloads.<br><br>I'm not complaining about a lack of success.<br><br>What I'm unsure of is - and this is my ex-paranoid mind speaking:<br><br>Is there some conspiracy organised by someone like Google or someone higher up to prevent me from having any level of reach or success in my own IT hobby efforts?<br><br>Surely not, surely that's crazy talk. Surely that's absolutely ridiculous.<br><br>Here's a picture for you.<br><br>The following game comes up in Google Play store search results ahead of mine, well ahead of mine, and has the following features:<br><br>Rating 2.6<br>1000-5000 Downloads<br>A black screen as the screenshot.<br><br>Now if Google is the king of search engines then why is their search so bad when it comes to my own efforts?<br><br>How do I explain this without resorting to conspiracy theories?<br><br>How do I explain this without resorting to ideas of paranoid delusion?<br><br>Is it just something weird that happens - a random weird result of the search results?<br><br>Is it just that google's algorithms are bad?<br><br>Or are they working against me to succeed/annoy me? Of course not - that is crazy talk.<br><br>But I cannot believe that Google's search engine is *that* bad.<br><br>And this is just one aspect of the situation. There are far more examples I can find. I just don't get it.<br><br>Like I said - I'm not complaining about not getting thousands of downloads or anything...I just feel that whatever I do I'm not going to get any result at all.<br><br>When I was in hospital in 2015 a patient broke into my room when I was out, mucked up all my belongings and wrote a note in my notepad that said "If you finish your game no one will play it" - which was quite prescient and sticks in my head as an example of pretty much exactly what will happen....there were other comments made in that time, some of which were by people who were crazy that haven been shown to be strangely accurate and weird too....there is a sense that my crazy period gave me an insight into the world in a bizarre way that is somewhat real....but it can't be.<br><br><br>(example of app that comes up before mine...well before mine)<br><img src="http://www.mattiesgames.com/gfx/rubbish.jpg"> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

With games, you get a million duds and a handful of runaway success. For every angry birds that has tens of millions of downloads, there are a hundred thousand other apps that will never even make back their development cost.<br><br>And a LOT of this is plain and simple luck, or simply spending tens of millions of dollars on advertising. Candycrush wasn't the first match-3 game, it certainly isn't the best, yet they managed to make millions. Luck, deep pockets and persistence got them there.<br><br>Flappy Bird was a <i>stupidly</i> simple and basic game, yet a huge success. Complete luck -- there's a million near identical clones that failed miserably even though they may look, feel and play better than the original.<br><br>Try to see it from the other side: Honestly -- what do you think the likelihood that you yourself would spend a buck on some random game you've never heard of that you see an ad for? Most likely, you'll just ignore it, same as everyone else. *eventually* a game may get enough players that word-of-mouth starts kicking in, and if you're lucky things may snowball into success... But realistically those hits are few and far in between.<br><br>Once a game studio makes it to the top they can sell a ton simply based on their name: E.A. can sprinkle some glitter on a turd and sell a 20 million pre-order copies simply because they've had a decent track record. For the rest of us it's an uphill fight.<br><br>(As far as the codes you posted here are concerned: I did see them, but personally I generally don't care for RPGs and those kind of games, so I didn't bother activating a copy, left it for others that may like them instead.)<br><br><br>Anyway -- don't give up, just don't believe all the hype that you read about mobile gaming. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Just on the way it looked, I didn't want to investigate further.  People say graphics don't matter but they really, really do.  They're your proverbial shop window.  It's what draws people in in the first place.  Even Asda would be out of business within the week if they smeared the front of their shops with cow-turds, regardless of how much advertising they do.<br><br>I appreciate that you might want to learn to do your own artwork but speaking from personal experience and not to put too fine a point on it, it's f****ng hard when you're not a "natural".  Fair do's, occasionally some self-professed "artists" can get away with being no good at it - Picasso, for example (seriously - go look at his work), but for most of us, lack of talent is an obstacle.<br><br>I'm not sure what software you're using for artwork but I highly recommend Clip Studio Paint (formerly Manga Studio).<br><br>Oh yeah, and as has already been said - don't fuel your paranoia by wasting your time with Android/iOS.  Stop wasting your money on Google AdWords, go and draw loads of stuff, throw it away, and draw it again.  In your spare time, get yourself a copy of "Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain" by Betty Edwards, and read it from front to back.  If you can't get hold of it, at least do some research on drawing negative space - it will help you no end. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Fonts not fitting to the "theme" - looking like system fonts blit on a win32-gui in win98. Use Bitmapfonts with some styling (color, texture, ...) or at least a fitting one with some antialias. The fighter-girl has jaggy outlines as if it was ripped from somewhere - did the author/artist who has done this game not have a short glance at his project when adding it?<br>Why has the button at the bottom no outline (and same for the girl) while the scroll has one - and what is that "king-icon" on the scroll?<br><br>It looks like a mixture of elements put together rapidly for a "prototype" of a game.<br>This is eg. one of the reasons why I suggested you "Autodesk Sketchbook Free" to try out with your wacom. You might even want to check out Inkscape or so (as it eases "adjustments" afterwards - and vector shapes are always a nice to have).<br>Your characters (see the other thread) are still a bit inconsistent and expose too many details for the size you are using them - and too less details for showing them as "avatars" in ingame screens. They would need to get "painted again" (use them as background, draw clear and non-jaggy-outlines - eg with vectors or a good drawing app).<br>This approach also allows to do "variations" of an existing character very easily.<br>Drawing them with solid colors allows for a consistent shading afterwards (eg the cartoonic one with a bright fill on top and a dark at the bottom - no gradients needed at all).<br><br><br><br>Ok, so excuse me for sounding that harsh this time. But please... please create/continue a thread for this game and LISTEN to the feedback people give you and OVERHAUL the whole thing. There is so many one could improve asset-wise in that game. <br>And once it looks "convincing" enough you could still listen to the people blaming boring gameplay - because this is also a very subjective topic. While we are hmm let's say "more than average" smart the most players in the world are "average and below" and they do not need uber-complex games. They from time to time like to play repetitive games - like doing 100 quests which are mostly the same (WoW anyone?). And even we "smart asses" do that just to take an outtime from the hard day jobs or "tinker times".<br><br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
