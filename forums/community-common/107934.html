No doubt influenced by pakour videos. Then came the moment that I knew I was dreaming and decided to jump very high up and fly across to another building. I could feel the adrenalin kicking in. The next jump I tried though took me way up into the clouds and I immediately woke up because I thought I was going to continue on up and never come back down to earth.<br><br>One really strong lucid dream though felt more like remote viewing because I found myself in a completely empty street standing outside a particular house. This time the surroundings were clear and I felt compelled to look around for clues to see if I can pinpoint the location. I recall having to really force myself to look at the front door and could clearly see the number 20. Everything was vivid but more like a scene you would see through night vision goggles. What was a bit strange though, I looked into one of the windows hoping to see my reflection yet nothing was there. Again I got spooked and woke up.<br><br>This leads me onto a topic I found relatively interesting. Whether or not you as a being/soul/spirit are present in some location when you have such vivid dreams? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I would regular dream about him not realising that I was in a dream. Then one time we were in a car together and while in my dream I remembered that he passed away, I told him in the dream and then everything went into a kind of hyperspace tunnel vision effect but as if I was stationary and everything was moving away from us. At that point I woke to find myself in a kitchen with my mum. I told her of my dream only to then wake again into the 'real world'. Since then I dream of my dad quite often at seemingly random times and again I remind him that I must be dreaming as he has passed away. He seems ok with it now and we can stay in the dream for longer and longer as I have each dream episode. Either way it's really nice to spend time with again even if it is just purely my own thoughts and imagination or whether there is more to it.<br><br>My mum has had incredibly strong dreams. One time we went on vacation as a family. We had gone to a place that none of us had ever been to before. As we approached the villa she told us that she has been here before and that she remembers it quite vivdly. She then went on to describe with amazing accuracy and detail all of the tiny furnishings, that were was odd cutlery in the drawers, little marks on walls and windows, plates dishes, the arrangement of the furniture plus much more - all before we went into the place. Pretty awesome really. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

(the movement was kinda unintentional)<br>When the vertical position was reached, i somehow found myself again back in the bed, lying down, again trying to stand up.<br><br>Infront of me, just where i was previously in the vertical position - there was an yelowish/transparent silhouette consisted of head-body-arms.<br><br>Again i was moving up to reach the vertical position, but somehow in the middle of the way i was again back into the sleeping position, but now seeing 2 silhouettes, in which i previously had my eyesight.<br><br>After seeing this i felt back into sleep.<br><br>Few days/weeks later, i opened the eyes again, laying in the bed. Obviously it was this dream/whichever state.<br>I was surrounded by couple of yellowish beings, one looked like a woman - ghost. (just as how you would imagine a ghostly being).<br>As soon as that ghost saw that i'm watching it, it flew in direction of my head, after which i was asleep again.<br><br>Then there were few of Dream interruptions. I do not mean awakening from the dream, but the dreams somehow stopped.<br><br>For example, i was in a kind of savanna, of which i could identify as the barrens area of the WoW game (which i have played then). <br>It was not in game setting but more like a waking world area. There was a tiger or a Leon, which has chased me, and i was obviously running away or walked back. At some point, there was a hole, but entering it, the whole landscape started to fly up.<br>(the same effect when you are programming a 3d matrix, and the player runs out of the boundary, making him fall down)<br>just before the fall, there was a sound.<br>And i was watching all this for 10~15 seconds, and then i fell back to sleep.<br><br>Then there was a dream interruption, in which a Girl, which i have not saw before that point, was standing infront of me. <br>As the previous dream was somehow wasched away, (i was talking to someone in the dream) i still continued to talk and  wondering what has happened.<br><br>Few days after this dream, i have had some strange dream. a child was playing on a grassy area - (the colors of this dream were gray'ish).<br>The child suddenly standed up and started running, and there was a machine, which at the same time stared rolling to the child.<br>As the child stopped, so did the machine, barely touching the foot of the child.<br>The camera started moving towards him, picked it up. There were hands of this body, which touched the foot. There was blood on the first sight, on the second everything was ok.<br><br><br>The Girl from the 1st dream i'v meet 3 moths later (vacation time). It was the Daughter of the, now, wife of my brother.<br><br>At the same day, i was told that a child (age arround 6y) of a friend were there last year, and he has forgotten his toy. (Bucket excavator type, similar but not exactly i do not know the english name)<br>1 1/2 weeks later, there was a small party, in which this child was present too. He was playing with the rolling fence.<br>He managed to pull the fence out of the safety stop, and this fell on the grass.<br>I standed up to put the gate back into its place, when my eyesight caught the place where his foot was. <br>The gate missed his feet, everythig was ok !<br><br>After we fixed the gate, i was sitting there thinking what has just happened. in the dream, at the very end, i had an impression that i should not talk about it there (so i haven't).<br><br>maybe ill write more, later. lets see. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Usually in this state you have woken up too early and your body is likely to be in a state of paralysis (to prevent you acting out your dreams).<br>That's why when I tried to look at the door number in my 'dream' mentioned in the first post it was a real effort to turn my head (because I was physically paralysed).<br><br>I used to suffer from waking up too early then having the feeling that I am floating separately from my physical body. One time I drifted out of the bedroom and was close to the brick wall from the outside. I could feel myself rising upwards. Again I got spooked and felt a whooshing sound which snapped me back and made me wake up in an instant. Scary stuff at the time!<br><br>All this floating upwards would always make me wonder where I was going and whether allowing it to continue would be ill-fated.

What you describe is not lucid dreaming, but rather sleep paralysis.  In lucid dreaming, you are fully in REM sleep state, but your dream self knows he is dreaming.  Sleep paralysis is when your mind wakes up while it is still partially in the REM state.  You will feel paralyzed and possibly exhibit some form of hallucinations.  <br><br>You can usually tell the difference as when you are having a lucid dream, your environment behaves like a dream.  Usually having trouble focusing on something specific such as a headline in a newspaper, or the time on your watch, or may find yourself suddenly in another location. You will have that "foggy" sensation that you do when you dream.  In sleep paralysis, most things will be very tactile.  You will actually feel something pressing down on you, hear actual voices, see people and creatures as though they were in the room with you.<br><br>I have experienced both lucid dreaming and sleep paralysis (both hypnagogic and hypnopompic).  When I have a lucid dream, I will usually try and do things I can't in real life, such as flying.  Sleep paralysis has exhibited itself as a hand pressing down on me preventing me from moving, seeing my room lit by a very bright light even though it was dark, and hearing my name yelled out when I was alone.  Typically, I experience sleep paralysis when I am under a lot of stress.<br><br>There is another sleep phenomena called False awakening.  It is when you dream that you woke up, but are actually still dreaming.  That has happened to me a few times.  Usually when I become aware that I am in a nightmare, I will try and force myself to wake up.  That usually results in me waking up.  Sometimes it only results in me thinking that I woke up.  I can go about my business as though I were conscious,  only realizing that I am still asleep when something strange happens (usually I try to talk and can't). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Time imho is just a side effect of moving matter(as all so called physics 'forces/laws'). Just think: If all matter would be motionless fixed in place, time would *not* exist. And as such all other 'forces'.<br><br>Anyway, to get back on topic:<br><br>1) As a small child I used to have a very vivid, reoccurring, frightening nightmare which used to terrify me. Happened usually when I was about to get flue, drank Coca-Cola or slept on my back. This prevented me for years to sleep on my back for I noticed that way dreams would come more often.<br><br>The dream looked very similar to an SF alien kidnapping horror movie I've seen decades later. Not that I believe in that, could very well be influenced by feeling like surrounded by aliens in kindergarden :-).<br><br>It only went away round 12 years old when I heard that one has to try getting passed the scary part instead of running away/waking up, so lucid dreaming yes, been there.<br><br>2) As a child I also was sleepwalking and also remember running down the stairs of the house we used to live, very scared, half awake feeling like flying down, almost not touching any steps, only 1 or 2. Strange feeling, probably was still half paralyzed.<br><br>3) I had predictive dreams(many times) to come true in half to 2 years later. Most of the time when realizing I dreamed of a certain situation I am in I can still remember a couple of secs upto 20 secs ahead of what is coming next. The rest of it is a usually a blur as if a dream that fades when waking up.<br><br>4) When I was in my 30's and living by myself I once had a vivid dream but felt as if I was awake. I was in bed sleeping and suddenly heard what I would describe as laughter from a crowd outside the house(mind you: I lived on the 4th floor :-) gradually increasing in volume and ammount, then the sound came through the wall, then near me and into my head. It then stopped and same thing happend but this time it was a buzzing sound like a big humm, causing vibrations. At the time it got in my head I started to rise up, legs first heading towards the ceiling.<br><br>Felt a bit like being sucked up by a giant vacuum cleaner and it felt great but on the other hand very scary. When finally only my shoulders were still attached to the bed I started fighting for I was afraid what would happen if I'd let go and got detached. Eventually 'it' let go of me, the sound stopped, I dropped back onto the bed and the height of the drop caused the bed to still be shaking when I woke up. Very weird, but fantastic feeling.<br><br>5) Round the same time I once had a dream of being in a library of all knowledge, but I rejected for things I'd seen in a split sec where to much for me to take. Like opening the lid of a sewer and the smell overwhelms, and you refrain.<br><br><br>6) I also had more lighter dreams(literally ;-) flying through the streets on occasion. Very cool. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This is true, but you have to understand that unchangeable means that it is not stalled. That means that the reality, which God has created, is forever increasing - means: it can not not increase.<br><br>It is maybe not understandable with material, but it is very understandable in Spiritual terms.<br><br>So the reality, which you experience as changeable, is not True. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Anyway, back on the Topic:<br><br><b>Remote viewing</b>: the term suggest that you can see what is happening on some place, where you (read your body) is not now.<br><br>This is true, and everyone on earth is able to do it (without exceptions), but it does not follow that everyone is able to do it. (here is another hair in the soup ^^)<br><br>To be able to understand what Remote viewing is, ill assume that you are on the point where you still believe more in Ego-thoughts than in God, and start my explanation from that point of view. <br><br>Ill give you two exercises with which you could train this remote viewing ability. (p.s. H.i.S.)<br>(it will help, as well with the astral projection and dreams, but each follows automatically, although you may not know how to do remote viewing)<br><br>But first, you will need to know what you are doing. <br>This reality, as you see it, is, actually, only content in your Mind.There are no 9 billions different minds, it is only one mind. <br>That's the reason why it is possible to see things where you are not now. (the reason for telepathy etc etc too)<br><br>Basically you are instructing your Mind to look at any place on the earth (now, right at this time - say: not casting it into past nor future). <br><br>(p.s. Read following very slowly - pausing at the each dot:)<br><br>For example, right now, you can see what is at the outer limit of the whole universe. You can look back and see all the stars and galaxies that were created. <br>And while you are watching from the place where nothing is created yet, you can slide down, through all Galaxies, through earth and sun, to the exact opposite side of the universe, where again nothing is created yet.<br><br>If you have had any slight images (or mind movie) in your mind about this 2 places, then that's basically it.<br><br>You have to understand, that any lower interests, for example if you want to see your Dream girl or Boy naked, will block you from this ability, and you will be using imagination instead.<br>This says not that you will not be able to see it otherwise, but lower, egoistic intentions will lead you into imagination instead of remote viewing.<br><br>When i talk about egoistic intentions, even if you are trying to prove that someone is Guilty or has done something (especially Criminal investigations), is lower intention, so try not to fall for it.<br>If you fall for it, a delay is needed (read time passing) until you can use it again. This is because the one low intention will cause you to repeat it. If you do not know this, you will use imagination and your results will be false.<br><br>You can do the exercise with eyes open, but closing eyes will bring better results, as you wont be distracted by your sight.<br><br>Before i start with the exercise, you will need to know more:<br><br>You see, this world, especially seen in the Schools, has taught you following: "Success brings rewards. Failure brings punishment."<br><br>This exercise you will need to do, but not to seek for approval. Seeking for approval will, in this case, be contra-productive. <br>Especially if you are the school type of thinker, wanting immediate rewards will lessen your interest and success in this case.<br><br>So your main concern will be, if you want to do it, on improvement of the ability, not on the validity of the seen things.<br><br>The later will be, later. (<u>how long i can't tell, and i can't promise that you will succeed</u>)<br>Plan 2~5 years in training. And if you still want to do it, here it is:<br><br>The drill is always the same, for every place which you choose.  <br><br>One or two times in a day, depending on your energy do:<br><br>1. Find a quiet place<br>2. calm yourself, and your thoughts down.<br>3. Launch your imagination, until you see the pictures/images arising.<br>4. STOP imagining, but leave the pictures be there.<br>5. Be curious and explore. But without excitement.<br>6. Return, write down what you saw, and continue with your life.<br><br><br>So for the start, if you have 2 rooms at home, go in the room, in which you are the most of time.<br>Look around what is there, then go back into your bedroom. Close your eyes, and calm yourself down.<br>Gaze into the darkness of your eyelids until images start coming (doing these exercises will improve the seeing of images here). (if not, launch your imagination and see yourself standing up, going into the other room and looking around - basically recall the previous steps in your mind)<br><br>See yourself in the other room, stop recalling, and start looking around. If you find things out of place, that is ok. <br>When you have enough of the exploration, imagine yourself walking back into the body.<br>Then wait few seconds, open your eyes and write down what you saw. (at least recall, again, what you have experienced) <br>Do not go in that room to check or prove if everything is as you saw it. Just be happy that you have done it.<br><br>If you have done the exercise in the morning, then either repeat it later in the afternoon or next day.<br><br>Repeat the exercise with the one room, until a kind of boringness appears. (you will recognize it by not wanting to do the exercise)<br>In that case use another room. Repeat (repeat, here, means on daily basis, not the repeating in one day) until the boringness appears, then choose another place. <br>(maybe outside of window)<br><br>When you are confident enough, recall places without visiting them first, but which are known to you (eg, workplace, market where you mostly go to buy things, discotheque etc etc)<br><br>It is ok to take a day or 2~3 off, from the exercises, but do not delay them for too long. <br><br>The success rate depends on your ability to distinguish Imagination from Viewing. <br>That's why a very long period of training is needed, before you can try to view things and seek for validity.<br><br>The more training, the more vivid will the images be. <br><br>Happy remote viewing. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
