Memes were kind of goofy and crude when they started, because it was just some kid making something that looked awful with MS Paint.  Now they are a programmed response.  "Oh there's that funny cat, now let me post a comment that is from some video game or movie".  It's even coming out into advertising:<br><br><img src="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/enhanced/webdr06/2013/5/2/14/enhanced-buzz-32112-1367520958-1.jpg"><br><br>Like the whole world is turning into that annoying kid in high school who compulsively quoted movie lines all the time.<br><br>Everything on Facebook and LinkedIn is "Epic" and "Brilliant" now.  Basic food items can't be mentioned without a lot of fake enthusiasm, like bacon and garlic bread.  Yay, carrots!  Dude, they are so epic!!  I kind of hate adding bacon to anything now because I risk getting the "Oh yeah, gotta have bacon!!!" response.<br><br>There are tons of blogs and articles out there about everything under the sun, but they are mostly repeating the same viewpoints.  There's no diversity of ideas like you would get by reading books from different countries, from different centuries.<br><br>I feel like the whole world is becoming more neurotic and everyone is turning into an old lady who loves "America's Funniest Home Videos".  The combination of old ladies and Facebook has been disastrous.  It's replacing humor with stupid programmed responses.  Oh, there's that funny picture, now I must laugh.<br><br><img src="https://thechive.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/wholesome-memes-28.jpg"><br><br>In this huge wash of noise real information is being lost.  Anything that could actually be interesting is drowned out by "yay for green beans".<br><br>I don't know if everything's getting more annoying or if I am just becoming more normal, but this stuff really bugs me and makes me want to stay off the internet altogether and just read a book.  I think this kind of thing changes your thought processes in negative ways.  I don't want anyone to ever text me a funny picture again. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
