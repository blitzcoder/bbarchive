Some of you have made a number of strong criticisms of it I know-which is easy enough to do.<br><br>But I now consider the game a resounding success.<br><br>I've been playing mobile games for years and there arena couple of things that make me pleased as the developer of Star Dancer.<br><br>1.  I still play it a few times a week after 2 years.  For a mobile game that's almost unheard of for me as most games I uninstall after one partial play through and I always rate them. Star Dancer has kept me engaged as far as space combat games go for two years.<br><br>2.  There are players who enjoy the game.  Most of the users on the blitz forum dont like it and that's fine.  My metrics show that 80 percent of players are not engaged.  But about 12% are highly engaged by the game.  That's actually a lot.  I may not have a huge installer base but there are a handful of players who love the game.<br><br>3. This morning I have a player who as we speak has fought five battles, 3 campaign and two quick battles, who has made full use of the AI settings, who has played for over an hour and thoroughly enjoys the game.<br><br>4.  There are a handful of players who fought 30 to 40 battles.  I'd say they enjoy it.<br><br>5. I had a youtube reviewer review the game and give it a high rating back in November 2015.  Very pleasing.<br><br>I'm proud of my effort with Star Dancer and despite a number of nay sayers about it, it has truly thrilled me to bits.  I love playing it still and there is a small number of players who enjoy it almost as much as I do. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So, it can be either personal satisfaction about been able to deliver game, or how it plays or simply put...money...<br><br>Thats more/less all about it. And whichever pick is yours, thats what matters.<br><br>Personally, I slowed down my enthusiasm about games, because of ratio time spent/money earned out of it. Actually, I earned a lot from outsource works I have done for consoles. But I left it because, as much as it pays, its a constant race with time. Instead, I returned to things I did professionally before (electronics/firmware design), and im beating up some nice money doing that while have a lot of time available. <br><br>I guess you do not living out of games selling, so non money satisfaction/success makes sense. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Not a million.  I would have considered it a financial success had i had that many.  Even ten thousand would have been 'ok'.  I based my estimates off similar types of games in the play store that had those kinds of results.  My estimates to my thinking seemed fair and reasonable.<br><br>Over time i learned to revise down my measure of what i called success based on the reality i saw.  Instead now i am merely happy when i can see through my metrics a player gain satisfaction from my game.  The meyrics are detailed enough that i can sense when a player enjoys it.<br><br>So my metric for success has come down from 15k users to whenever 1 user every few months really enjoys it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Most of that idea doesnt come through in the final design very clearly but if you look hard enough you can get a sense of it.  <br>The free version had just the allies and german factions.
