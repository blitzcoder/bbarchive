So I built the Game in Release Configuration, took the .exe and the data Folder and created an InnoSetup setup for it. When someone else installed and started the game, the error message "OpenAL32.dll is missing" appeared. "The Application was unable to start correctly (0xc000007b). Click OK to close the Application". Do you have any idea how I can fix this issue and export a setup for windows?<br><br>Luca <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The two biggest issues that come to mind are ABI compatibility and user-permissions. Ideally, you would install it on the system properly, but in practice, you're shipping with your executable. Thankfully, portals like Steam have made this easier, though. On Steam, they just automate running the redist-installers before first launching the game. Too bad Microsoft doesn't understand how to properly distribute their binaries. I've had so many versions of DirectX's runtimes, DotNET's runtimes, and MSVC's runtimes. Now, this is understandable to some extent, compatibility and all, but if the vast majority of my installed programs are DLLs, and nothing else, something's wrong.<br><br>The fact is, none of the existing platforms has an ideal package manager for dependencies. Linux has the closest working one, but there's still plenty of issues with it. At this point everybody, even the C++ standards committee is trying to fix this. Sadly, it's turning out like that one <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/" target="_blank">XKCD comic</a>. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The point I was trying to make was having the exact same library installed multiple times. As for Windows, well the file system is a complete mess and no one with over all control of what goes where. Linux has a file hierarchy standard of what is meant to go where and the control is down to the administrators of the vendor repositories, but not all Linux distributions follow this standard and vendors have no control over third party software. The package building tools usually give warnings when some thing is non compliant.<br><br>The Linux package manager is the closest because of who controls the main repositories and the fact that the software on them is effectively locked down and with the usual security updates to work with that particular version. This in turn is why the systems happen to be more reliable as long as you stick to using one of the fixed (i.e. Long Term Support) versions.<br>You tend to get people that download the latest release not realising that it's basically a testing branch and complain about it crashing. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
