The application will run, but cannot find it's media and throws an exception that you cannot see if you have built it in release mode. It gives the impression that the application has just hung. It could be a file permission thing, so copy over the files to the local hard drive. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

And I think that using Ziggy's set up tools in Jungle, download TDM-32 and uses the Creative OpenAL installer, so no need for adding the -m32 switch as it defaults to building 32bit binaries. If you installed OpenAL using the Creative installer, then if you had built your application with TDM-64, it wouldn't be able to link to it with OpenAL with it being a 32bit DLL; you would get a OpenAL DLL not found error here. The solution would be to recompile using the -m32 switch or download either the OpenAL-Soft pre compiled Widows binaries or the source code and build it yourself as a 64bit DLL. There are a few people that swear that OpenAL-Soft is a hell of a lot faster than the Creative version. Another thing that can be an issue with using a GCC compiler are the OpenAL LIB files that you find in the target templates. GCC should complain about these being incompatible binaries. They should be for the Microsoft tool chain.<br><br>As mentioned. Use a debug build and try executing from the command line on the end users machine to see if there are any problems.<br><br>You will find the GCC Makefile in two locations for both glfw targets. You just add the -m32 switch to CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS Makefile variables.<br>The primary location to make changes is in the targets\glfw\template\gcc_winnt Makefile. Open it up in word pad as using note pad may have problems with the CR/LF making it unreadable.<br>And you will find a copy in the projects .build(version)\glfw\gcc_winnt<br>But making changes to your projects .build Makefile requires that you locate and remove all the intermediate object files before recompiling with any changes. If you make the changes to the target template Makefile all you do is just delete the projects .build directory. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
