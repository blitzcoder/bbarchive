That's only one option on Windows, though. The current preferred compiler for Windows is MinGW, but Visual Studio works fine. And of course, the older XNA target uses the C# version of VS2010 Express (Could possibly use something else with some tweaking). Mark has talked about moving to 2013 (Or newer) for the MSVC side, but nothing's been done yet. You can still use VS2013 (Or similar) to convert the projects over, if you're worried about that. It's not like they're a big deal. Visual Studio (And related tools) has/have systems in place for backward and forward compatibility of binaries, if you're interested. Monkey's output for the standard C++ target, GLFW targets, and as far as I know, the iOS target are all based on the same "generator" built into the compiler, and they produce standard C++ code. The Windows 8 / Windows Phone 8 targets are not standard C++ targets.<br><br>However, if you're talking about the Windows 8/8.1 specific targets, they're based on a managed variation of C++ that Microsoft has built. Code written in that basically compiles into DotNET byte-code. The Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 targets rely on this, so if you're interested in deploying to those targets, this is the wrong section.<br><br>This section of the forum is for the GLFW 2 and 3 (OpenGL based) standard C++ targets, meaning they're compiled with the standard version of MSVC, as well as GCC/MinGW. To put it simply, the Windows 8 "Metro" targets have their own section, as they're different in many regards (They're also DirectX based, from what I remember).<br><br><b>To summarize: you generally can't use the 2010 projects with newer versions of Visual Studio, but they can convert the project pretty easily. If you need to do this, you should modify what's in the "targets" folders. Code-wise, there shouldn't be a problem. You can also use MinGW or GCC if you're not willing to use VS2010. The Windows 8/8.1 "modern app" targets are different, and they require a different version of Visual Studio altogether.</b><br><br>If you want to easily automate this process, <a href="http://www.monkey-x.com/Community/posts.php?topic=8519&amp;page=first" target="_blank">there's this tool</a>, and I think JungleIDE also has a tool for it (Not sure if that's available in the free version, though).<br><br>Yeah, I'll be honest, Microsoft is terrible about managing Visual Studio; I have half a dozen versions of it for everything I've done the last few years. In order to get all of Monkey's targets running (Assuming you want MSVC2010 for the GLFW targets), you'll need 3 versions of Visual Studio (Or you'll need to upgrade the project files). Of course, all of them are optional, but two are needed for a few targets. That's one of the prices to pay for using a tool like Monkey. This isn't really a Monkey issue, it's a Microsoft software management issue. Mark should probably update the project files already, though. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It doesn't cost anything, and it's generally a good idea to make one. The license eventually runs out, but you basically just get prompted to get another one, which is also free. Other than that, you're good; MinGW and GCC are open source and have standard distributions, so they'll always be free. Quite a few targets aren't free when you want to release your games, though. Unless something's changed, the Android Store(s) have small fees for hosting. Not sure about Microsoft's new "modern app" store, but I imagine it's similar. The only major offender in this regard is iOS, where you can't even develop for it without a license from Apple (Which was $100 from what I remember). But for the targets we've been talking about, they're free to develop for.<br><br>And as Ziggy said, MSVC tends to be faster for large projects. This is because Monkey always uses a very high optimization level, you can generally make builds faster by changing the MAKE files in the "targets" folders. I personally use MSVC on Windows because it's easy to set up third party libraries, but it's not like MinGW is bad about this. I use GCC when developing on Linux and OS X. On Windows, I tend to use MinGW for small projects that aren't made in Monkey. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I honestly haven't messed with the Windows 8 targets in a while, so I'm not too sure if there actually is a newer version of Visual Studio that supports the "modern app" stuff. 2012 is working just fine for me right now, I had to renew my license, but all I had to do was log in. I'm running Windows 8.1, and I am using Visual Studio Express 2012 (For Windows 8; update 4, specifically). That shouldn't be confused with the standard Visual Studio versions for normal desktop development. From what I know, there really isn't a proper 2013 express version for "modern apps" yet. I could be wrong, though. Regardless, it's working fine for me, so if Sub_Zero's tool (Or any other tool) has you get the Windows 8/RT specific version, then that's probably your best option. If a new free/express version supports the Windows RT / 8 / "modern" platform (I call it Metro myself, but MS doesn't anymore), then you should be able to convert the project/solution file(s) anyway. Also keep in mind that Monkey (As well as most programs) doesn't allow you to launch from a normal desktop environment (An annoying decision on Microsoft's side), so you're forced to open the solution manually in order to run it. From what I've heard, this hasn't changed. The builds Monkey and VS2012 produce shouldn't have any compatibility problems with Windows 8.1.<br><br>This makes me wonder if the commercial versions of 2013 have support for this platform, but it's not a big deal to begin with. 2015's going to be out pretty soon, anyway. If you're interested in that, I think preview builds are available, but Monkey doesn't support it yet.<br><br>As for the Android SDK version, unless you're using external/native code yourself (Or a module that needs a specific version of the API), you shouldn't need a higher version. The manifest file (Found at "targets/android_new/template/templates/AndroidManifest.xml") specifies the minimum and targeted SDK versions, so if you need something newer, then you should just be able to change them. The target I'm referring to is the one dedicated to experimental/newer versions of Android, so the targeted and minimum versions may by changed by Mark later down the road. I haven't messed with the Android targets in a while, so I'm not the person to talk to about that. To my knowledge, there isn't an explicit API19 target, as you can just request it via the manifest. The thing about Android is that people run different versions, so requesting a mid-range version of the API is ideal. Since Monkey doesn't directly need newer than 2.33-ish (Could change later), it's not really a big deal.<br><br>If GLFW is running choppy for you, there's as a number of reasons why that could be the case. For example, bad OpenGL drivers, or perhaps the standard C++ garbage collector needs to be configured, or it could be completely unrelated. I don't have any major problems using GLFW myself. And if it wasn't obvious, make sure you're making a release build, not a debug one. It's also completely possible that your program is having problems because of a system bottleneck. For example, if you're making a lot of objects in your update-routine, you could be causing unneeded overhead. <a href="http://www.monkey-x.com/Community/posts.php?topic=9436#98036" target="_blank">I wrote</a> some posts <a href="http://www.monkey-x.com/Community/posts.php?topic=9321" target="_blank">about this</a> in <a href="http://www.monkey-x.com/Community/posts.php?topic=9473#98474" target="_blank">the past</a>, if you're interested. Reusing objects is especially useful on Android, where garbage collection is a nightmare for everyone. But, if you're having problems with the GLFW target, that's pretty unusual. The GLFW target's garbage collector is a custom one Mark made, and it tends to perform rather well on modern desktops.<br><br>Hope this helps, and <a href="http://puu.sh/gpNra/65791c0609.png" target="_blank">just in case you were wondering</a>; that's what I have installed currently (On this machine alone; obviously, those aren't all needed for Monkey). Microsoft is really bad at managing Visual Studio releases. Don't even get me started on the redistributables, libraries, and tools (Several of which weren't shown there). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
