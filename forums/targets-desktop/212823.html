But I am pretty much a noob in that regard, I've tried some stuff but it doesn't compile so far. The problem is that I am trying to load insane map sizes into my strategy game and 32 bit ends processes at 2 GB, so I need more. Can someone guide me step by step? What files do I have to download?

TDM 5.x+ will do, but there is a known bug that stops it from using <b>.LIB</b> files. You will find some of these type of files in the directory <i>MonkeyX/targets/glfw3/template/openal/libs</i>. So these need to be removed, the directories renamed, or the gcc_winnt makefile altered as to not search in those locations (see the bit below).<br>You will also have to modify the config.winnt.txt in the MonkeyX bin directory and change the MINGW_PATH variable to point to the location of the newly installed TDM compiler.<br>You will also have to make a few changes to the makefile in <i>MonkeyX/targets/glfw3/template/gcc_winnt</i> if you wish to compile any application as a 32 bit executable.<br>You do this by adding the -m32 compiler option switch to CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS. You can also remove the -L options for openal/lib: leaving the openal/dll should be OK.<br>If you have Visual studio and know how to set up the solution files to compile for x64 then it's not such a problem if you edit the template solution in <i>MonkeyX/targets/glfw3/template/msvc</i>.<br><br>Second<br>You will need a 64 bit version of the OpenAL dynamic link library installed. You can copy the ones from the templates in the OpenAL directory mentioned above, or download the OpenAL-soft version from  <a href="http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal.html" target="_blank">http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal.html</a>. You will find that there are some pre-built binaries for Windows 32/64 bit that you can manually install to your system, but you have to make sure that the they are in the correct directory of Windows/System/32 for the library architecture and both have the name of OpenAL32. There is nothing stopping you from adding the dll in the final application directory when you are ready to distribute it.<br><br><b>But the real thing you should be thinking about is "Do I really need such large map files in the first place". Can they be optimised or pre-loaded in sections before use.</b> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The 64 bit version if I remember needs to go into Windows/System32 and the 32 bit version in Windows/SysWOW64 or create a system environment variable to include the locations in the system PATH variable. There should be plenty of tutorials on how to add additional system variable.<br>There is a caveat with putting those DLL directly into the system directories. Some programs expect to find the Creative Labs version installed and there are some inconsistencies between OpenAL-soft and the Creative release. As far as I am aware, there is no 64 bit version of the Creative Labs version of OpenAL. There are claims that there exists a 2.0 version for download, but the state nor the security of it cannot be confirmed. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You can access both 32 bit and 64 bit distribution ISO files and Network install via alternative downloads and use one of the mirrors.<br><br>And from a 64 bit Linux distribution, all it takes in most cases to build for both 64 bit and 32 bit is to install GCC multilib with both the the 32 bit and 64 bit run-time libraries, along with the 64 bit development libraries and a few system links for the 32 bit support. Then do a bit of makefile editing to add the aforementioned compiler flag. Hell, if you know what you are doing, with a few changes to transcc you can set up the system to do cross compiling with the Linux MinGW cross compiler or any other cross compiler.<br>It should be noted that for near maximum compatibility a Long Term Support distribution should be used and not what is in fact a testing branch or rolling release.<br><br>OS X has been 64 bit since Lion, but I don't know for sure if they have finally put the nail into the coffin for legacy 32 bit OS X applications or dropped 32 bit compilation from XCode, as I cannot install Sierra. But you can take it as read that you end up with 64 bit binary applications by default, as all new Apple devices have headed in that direction.<br><br>As for Windows, you need to see a tool to read the PPE header. But I would guess that it's a mish-mash of 32 bit and 64 bit with parts of the tools being compiled with BlitzMax. What you compile to depends on the compiler and it's flags. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
