I am the animator for the Character Shop program.  And here's my $.02<br><br>I was contracted to create the requested animtions for the project.  When Halo gave his final approval of my animations the contract was completed along with my obligations.  Halo was aware of the minor ground penetration issues with the death sequence and decided that they were no big deal.  He signed off on the work and my job was then complete.  There was no "warranty" stated or offered.  I am under no obligation to do any additional work.  <br><br>But...<br><br>I'm sorry to hear that people are passing on buying this program only because they feel one or two animations have minor issues.  I like this program and believe in what Halo's doing.  So even though I'm under no obligation to do so, I've decided (with Halo's blessing) to make animation tweaks on animations that need it.  <br><br>Here's the ground rules:<br>1) I want to compile a list of animations that users feel need adjustments.  I'll review the list and figure which anims need some lovin' (arm in death sequence) and which ones don't.<br><br>2) I'm not creating any new anims.  I know that everyone has that additional animation that's *so* crutial and should not have been left off the list.  Sorry, you'll have to take that one up with Halo.  Like I said, my contract is complete so this additional work I'll be doing for the good of the project, not for money.<br><br>3) I'll be doing the revisions on my off time so I don't have any ETA on when I'll have any/all of the revisions done.<br><br>Now it's up to you guys.  State *very* specific issues you have with individual animations (example: elbow through floor in death anim) and I'll plow through and figure which ones will get revisions.  I think Halo's already made an excelent tool.  But now you guys can help me notch it up a few more clicks!  What do you say? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I suppose you could counter that that's just the way it is with 3d models but I've already got truespace and that same headache. If it was an animation program where you could build your own animations after successfully rigging the model with just a few mouse clicks it would be awesome. I'm put off that it's touted as such but falls quite a bit short of that mark. Brutally honest but not meant in a mean spirited way. If it did what I said then I'd pay considerably more than what you're asking now.Of course, that would be a different program but might be worth consdiering going that route as far as the effect it might have on sales. <br>Also this "You can't sell the models you create" nonsense is a big turn off too.

I understand the additional anims that you want but once again this gets towards that slippery slope.  The new anims you ask for might be completely different from what someone else is looking for.  It's hard to come up with a true *complete* set.  Right?  While it'd be nice to make the anim list more robust I just don't think it's possible at the moment.  Halo's already made his investment in my work.  And I'm pretty busy balancing the 50 hour work week along with a Fiance and my own side game I'm developing (not to mention *trying* to get to play a little Doom3 :) )  <br><br>@Sybixsus  Cool!  Good start.  Obviously I din't animate the arm pointing straight into the ground so somewhere between my export and this finished product something got snafu'd.  It'd help to know which specific death anim this is but I'm sure I can track it down.  I'll review my anims and see if I can find where it went wrong.  Please feel free to add more like this (if there are any :) )<br><br>@Doggie  I'm sorry to say that Character Shop just might not be the right program for you.  I understand what you are searching for and would happily recommend that you turn your attention to the following programs: Kaydara Motion Builder Pro (www.kaydara.com) and Endorphin v1.6 (www.naturalmotion.com)  Hopefully these will be the tools that will enable you to get your work done right!

Not sure.<br><br>There's now easy way to animate a character at a pro level.<br><br>I tried mb and was not easy, I mean, is very well thought, and yep, if u come like me of animating with blender or cfx, anything with some pro features is easier, but for a newbie in animation...(and ppl in this thread, or several, don't even seem to be newbie in that) ...I don't think they find it easy. The other oen, I don't know.<br><br>Of course I prefer to animate my self with 100% freedom, but is like when I think about doing a game, while I know C++ and directx is the most professional way, I doubt I would ever be able (mostly with the time life already demands, and being an artist, prefer to dedicate quite a time to art)<br><br>So I guess is a good comparison :)<br><br>Seems what you have with this proggy is professional anims made by an artist so that provided the mesh is of certain type, it'll b eable to use anims that the usual coder wouldn't be able to output in his/her game.<br><br>As a last note: Animation is a profession by itself.Today, when I get into conversations for getting into a job, besides it use to be now word of mouth, (kind of a network of industry friends) , I'm asked to do a bit of all, if possible, but in perhaps other more stablished gaming countries, Animator is a profession by itself, in games. Funnilly is not the same for modelling; a character modeller use to be able to do textures, and uv mapping also. In the very long past, there was the modeller, the 2d guy making textures (usually the modeller made uv mapping, but sometimes the skinner preferred to do it; I do like to take control of all in a character) , and the animator (level designer was apart.) .Maybe this was just an impression I had some years ago, maybe I am wrong.<br><br>But today I keep saying offers like these: A company wants a modeller, and they ask him a load of skills, from drawing, to modelling, texturing, uvmapping.Big companies don't ask him making levels too, small ones do (they did to me, ask me every bit, and usually one has not same level in every task) , and apart, ask for "animators".<br><br>Imho, animation is key for a character. Of course, hardly a bad modelled character can be helped by a good animation, but animation is the life of it.<br><br>Looks this app has an specific viable niche ;)<br><br>And imho, at least to me, sounds generous the Dustin offer. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
