Some high-end applications allow you to paint directly onto a 3D model as well as create fake detail maps e.g. normal maps.<br><br>Blender, as far as I am aware can also do many of the things that an high-end 3D modelling application can do but has one major disadvantage... and that is it's user interface. But if you have the time to learn it's interface then it's possibly just as fast as one of the high-end applications.<br><br>Now imagine the number of applications need to do the same tasks. You would have to learn to use each applications interface and it's tools. On top of that will each application export to a file format that can be easily recognised by the others?<br> <br>Remember many of the high-end 3D modelling applications are aimed at professional computer graphic artists who's line of work may include TV and film production as well as games so the extra feature maybe needed. And as the industry standard appears to be 3D Studio Max that's what many will be using and possibly use a few of the other applications in-conjunction with 3D Studio Max. So to coin a phrase "time is money" springs to mind. <br><br>And as GaryV says "In the end it comes down to talent and finding what modeling program you can understand and use to get the best results and be the most productive with."<br><br>I tend to use Five applications but they are are mostly high-end<br><br><b>Cinema4D R11.5 XL</b>: This is a 3D Modelling/Texutering application created by Maxon and comes in a number of editions from the base version (good enough for games) to the full studio version that has been used in a number of films and TV shows. <br><b>EDIT: I have been trying out C4D R12 Studio... Verdict: "Avoid" as now getting your creations into another format has become impossible. Yet again Maxon have some how managed to screw to Export functions again. If it's not fixed by R12.5 then it looks like I will bee moving onto 3D Studio Max some time in the future.</b> <br> <br><b>ZBrush 4</b>: This is basically a model sculpting/texturing application that will allow you to create fake detail textures maps to be used with low poly models. There is a free tool to create these texture maps called xNormal but you have to supply it with two models.. One high poly and one low poly.<br> <br><b>Photoshop CS4 Extended</b>: The Gimp is the only free appliction that comes close to photoshop but hasn't got the Photoshop Extended 3D model painting features (and a few other things).<br> <br><b>Genetica 3.5</b>: This is a node based seamless texture creation tool. There is a free tool somewhere out there on the net that does the same thing ( I can not remember it's name ) but I found it's work flow awkward.<br> <br><b>Ultimate Unwrap3D</b>: A UV Editing tool. I use it as an importer/exporter just for the number of file formats it can handle. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
