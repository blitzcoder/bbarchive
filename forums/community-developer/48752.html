You must know it. Other than that, I love it. i squite flexible and powerful, and I like the way I have found to animate with it. yet though, I yet prefer to model with Wings3d an duv map with Ultimate, for now, at least till I dig better that area in XSI.<br><br>I doubt u'll go wrong with any of those. With both u need ultimate Unwrap, or something that converts well the *.x animations into b3d....Well, yep, Ultimate unwrap. There's an x importer now, free, for Max 6 and 7, haven't tested. And even a dotXSI importer for Max. This could be other way. Yet though for characters, I like quite a lot the x---&gt;Ultimate Unwrap--&gt;b3d path.<br><br><br>Oh, Messiah is standalone, as I suppose you prefer that, with the x export version, not the rendering version.

Its very cheap for what you get, and although you only want it for games animation now, you might want todo something else with it later on.<br><br>The renderer is beautiful, there has just been a big real time shader tool addon released for free, and using the autorigging inside XSI is a blessing.<br><br>It comes with a free rig, that you size up to your characters, and then it generates the bones from that (so it can fit any type of biped you are doing) then you can save animations and reuse them on other characters using the autorig (even if they are different sizes)<br><br>there is something similer in messiah, but from what i read it is currently broken.<br><br>XSI is an arse to learn, I have come from 3DMax and Maya, and even knowing them found XSI the biggest struggle at first, but after you get over the 3 day hump it starts to make more sence, and is quite well set out for games stuff.<br><br>You can also script in it very easily using Visual Basic, JScript and pyphon, so if you need your own tools there pretty easy to make (I made a couple of level building tools).<br><br>Also every animtion can be plotted. plotting is basically baking. If your making say bones react to gravity or something and you want to put that into your game, you can bake the bones animation driven by the gravity (or wave deformer, or moving along a curve) into the bones themselves, so you can then export fine to blitz.<br><br>oo and inbuilt cloth animation, which is quite basic, but perfect for doing robes, flags, clokes, skirts etc.<br><br>Pimping over :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

XSI might be more expensive but you DO get excellent modeler, mapper and renderer too, sort of "for free". And since all of these are components are integral they do work (obviously) together very well. <br><br>Plug-ins, additions and such have always compatibility issues IMO. We did evaluate Messiah too, but it seemed slightly slowly updated % buggy - and would have been a add-on to the LW which had already shown it's flaws... too flawed pieces of software rarely magically combine as one excellent one! :) <br><br>XSI was nice and although we were mainly looking for better app for our animation work needs, we found out that we could get better modeler too. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But it all seems fairly decent and good. As I said before, XSI is much more production proven for games, and are certainly going after the games market (and sucseeding). I hear most japanese games, tv and effects studios use it (capcom noteably in resident evil 4), valve used it for half life 2 and I think its being used in the next Unreal game.<br><br>It has alot of useful game tools that you don't see anywhere else and is fiarly easy to script in too add your own tools.<br><br>Also I hear it takes quite along time for messiah updates to come out (these are all off forums, but you know how unreliable they can be :) ). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
