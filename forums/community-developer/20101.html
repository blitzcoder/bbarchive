You can run you sound card off them but unless you've got a Terratec soundcard (or something similar) it's really not worth it. You're talking around £50 for the basic versions of these tools.<br><br>Then there are sample manipulation tools, there are loads of these, and personally I'd go for <a href="http://www.sonicfoundry.com" target="_blank">Sonic Foundry's 'Acid'</a> as I think it is superb, you can get sample CDs from their site too. Acid can also be used a mix down tool once you've created something on Cubase to add vocal or guitar tracks, a very handy piece of software indeed. Comes in at around £50. Acid comes in the form of Acid Hip-Hop, Techno, and Rock, each of these has a load of samples that are free to use in commercial projects (assuming you've bought the software) in the said style. What's also cool is that it just used regular Wav files so you can create your own too.<br><br>You've got sample creation programs like Rebirth by <a href="http://www.propellerheads.se/" target="_blank">Propellerheads</a> that is also superb and can also be linked in with cubase and cakewalk to beef up any sound with a nice analogue techno sound. Again mix it all down in Acid.<br><br>If you're thinking of getting hold of a good cheap synth you can't go much worse that a Yamaha DJX, they're dirt cheap and have some great sounds for dance music. However, if you're after cleaner sounds, great string pads and realisic pianos etc, you really want to go for a Korg. There are some old Korg sound modules like the 05R/w which you should be able to pick up for around £100 (if that) which are packed full of great sounds.<br><br>I think that's about it for starters. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The former is really good for setting sheet music to a MIDI soundtrack because you can represent the notes as music notation; just make the track you are creating match the sheet music.  The latter is really easy to compose original tunes in.  Note that I'm not a musician; these are mostly easy beginner's tools.  FruityLoops was recommended to me by accomplished electronic musicians.   I get the sense that, as a sample sequencer, it compares to Acid in much the same way that PaintShop compares with Photoshop for 2D graphics. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

They are as good as, if not better than hardware instruments and they exist solely in the digital domain of your PC (so no signal to noise ratio to worry about, plenty of memory and instant parameter recall). They are also much cheaper. You should probably start with a sampler as these can 'sample' and reproduce pretty much any sound, real or otherwise.<br>I reccomend the Halion sampler plugin, or Kontact if you're well versed in sampler tech.<br><br>Cubase is quite frankly the best thing in music/sound creation. I have it coupled with Propellerhead Reason, which can feed its audio directly into Cubase via an invisible system called ReWire.<br><br>When you stop and think about it, a sampler/synthesiser is just a highly specialised computer with inputs/outputs. Modern PCs blow the processing power of these things away by a huge margin, and editing on a computer monitor is a damn site easier than editing on a tiny LCD screen (refered to as 'trying to decorate a hall through a letterbox!).<br><br>I payed £1000 for an E-mu sampler, and £200 for Halion.

You put together several little musical themes and then you paint these all together adjusting the pitch, length, volume etc... The last part is to select an auto harmonizing method. The music can actually sound good! As of yet the program doesn't save in a usable format and I don't think you can change instruments.

Cubase is mainly a hobbyist sequencer and you wouldnt really find it in that many studio's<br><br>LOGIC AUDIO: i CANNOT believe nobody has mentioned this! i personally use this and i think it's much better then cubase. You'll find this in many recording studios specialising in dance music (but it's not so hot for recording / editing live bands)... the latest version (5) is now mac-only.<br><br>NUENDO: is basically a beefed up version of cubase.... with surround sound support &amp; video tools aswell.<br><br>PRO-TOOLS: now this is the daddy of the music world.... you'll find this in EVERY professional recording studio out there. The makers (digidesign) boldly claim that every CD in the top 40 at any time has been touched by pro-tools at some time in it's development.... they're probably right :) A complete Pro Tools HD3 package will cost you about £15,000, again, mac-only...<br><br>CAKEWALK: holds a very small market share.... mainly due to that fact that it doesnt support VST (Virtual Studio Technology), however the next version will through a DX-VST wrapper (i personally dont think this will be very stable though)<br><br>DIGITAL PERFORMER: another mac-only program, ive never used it.<br><br>FRUITY LOOPS: is a fun little program with a cult following.... it's really easy to use and you can get some decent results... i'd reccomend it to anyone on here wanting to write tunes for their games. (PC only)<br><br>REASON: Reason is a weird one, it's completely different from your traditional sequencer, i hate it personally but alot of people swear by it.. as skitchy quite rightly pointed out it can be combined with cubase via rewire... which i hear is a powerful combination.<br><br>SIBEILIUS: this is more for classical music and the like<br><br>wave editors:<br><br>SOUND FORGE: from the same people who brough you acid. It's a decent enough editor... all the functions you'd expect, except for VST SUPPORT! :( this is probably the most popular wave editor.<br><br>WAVELAB: from the people who brought you cubase and nuendo.. i think this is much better then soundforge... it's got a much nicer interface and it does more stuff.<br><br>COOL EDIT: another popular one, probably not as professional as soundforge or wavelab, but it's decent enough, i believe it DOES support VST plugins.<br><br><br>some VST plugins also worthy of a mention:<br><br>KONTAKT: Skitchy was quite right to point this one out, it's the don-daddy of all samplers... hard or soft. EXS24 and Halion are also good samplers.<br><br>FM7: is a really nice synth using FM synthesis... it's a bitch to program but you can get some nice sounds out of it.<br><br>Absynth: one of the best synths out there... great for atmospheric pads and stuff.... also a bitch to program.<br><br>ES2: Probably the best soft synth on the market right now.... it's exclusively for Logic Audio.<br><br>WAVES BUNDLEs: a top quality selection of DX plugins.... including the C1 compressor, L1 ultramaximiser, C4 multiband compressors, Q10 parametric EQ, IDR dithering etc<br><br><br>soundcards:<br><br>if you're only writing music inside your computer with no external gear, you can get away with a standard soundblaster. But the minute you add a keyboard or sound module... you'll need to get a better soundcard (soundblasters are not professional quality - even the top of the range audigy). Pro soundcards vary in price from about £130 up to about £1000. The terratec mentioned earlier in this thread, assuming it's the DMX6FIRE, is a decent budget card for around £160. Other budget cards worth a mention are the M-Audio Audiophile (£140), Delta 44 (£160) and Delta 66 (£200). Top of the range soundcards would be the Creamware Pulsar 2 (£550), MOTU 896 (£999) or the TC Powercore (£700)<br><br>hope thats cleared a few things up <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I use Impulse Tracker myself, but most of them operate in a similar way. Some can even take midi input (a keyboard) to create the tracks in realtime and then you can tweak that input when you're done.<br><br>Do a search for 'mod tracker' and I'm sure you'll find many of them. Instruments for them can be found in many places as well (most are free). Try <a href="http://www.modarchive.com/" target="_blank">http://www.modarchive.com/</a> for example.<br><br>CPU-usage for playing a mod is quite low actually. FMod's site claims something like 3% CPU-usage, so don't worry about that too much.<br><br>Russell <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
