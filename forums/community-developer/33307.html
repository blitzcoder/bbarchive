The program failed to operate as specified in the manual, so I replaced it with a more trustworthy program. Today I use XSI 3.5. It's worlds better than TrueSpace in terms of reliability, speed, layout, ability, complexity, etc...<br><br>XSI is on the expensive side for a modeling program but the idea of staying away from Caligari products holds for whatever modeler you might want to migrate too. Even some of the free modelers give you more reliability than GameSpace. It's true that if you have the time and patience you'll probably be able to learn how to work around the quirky tool set provided by Caligari. But it really requires a heavy commitment on your part.<br><br>Good Luck,<br><br>Ben <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
