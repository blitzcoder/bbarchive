I have been disgusted with Caligari since the TS 6.6 release and I found out that .X export was removed.  <br><br>It is time to vent.<br><br>Over the last 2 years I have probably thrown USD$1500 on TS upgrades and add on packs etc. Now after upgrading to TS6.6 I find they have crippled the .X export, something that, while not perfect, worked in TS6.5.  I feel that since getting TS 4.0 I have continually been "bait and switched" from promised features that didn't work to ad on packs of second rate plugins whose developers no longer support them and are horribly difficult to get registered and then to find that they are so error prone as to be useless.<br><br>Even after all of the wasted money and deluded expectations I held out hope that Caligari would see the error of their ways and release a patch to address the removal of functionality in TS 6.6 that I have paid for over the years.  No where in the upgrade literature did it say .X export was going to be removed.<br><br>But no.  They again make a money grab and offer GameSpace to plug the gap.<br><br>Roman has lost his way from the early days and now only appears to focusing his efforts on milking every last penny out of his loyal customers.<br><br>I have had enough.  I will no longer support Caligari.  In fact I intend to go out of my way to persuade others to spend their hard earned money elsewhere and keep themselves from a litany disappointment. (Hence this post)<br><br>Others should do the same.  Spend your money on a product that is stable, professionally supported and accepted.  The price may be a little higher up front but at least the features you need will work and your tools won't risk removal or potential crippling with each upgrade.<br><br>What's next for TS7.0?

It's flaky. I could forgive this in earlier versions, but not now at V6.5. An example? You can't copy and paste IK frames, instead you need to find and install a (thankfully free) 3rd party plugin to do so. Similarly, when animating an ik chain, make sure you go to the first frame and have selected the whole object, or your save may be corrupted. And make sure the 'nail' is in the same place at the start/end of your animation, else you'll get a save error. When you're working on such a labour intensive function as character animation, you just can't afford to have any doubts about the save function...<br><br>And yes, they 'broke' the directx import with their 'service pack', and although they said they'd fix it, they've been damned slow to do so.<br><br>Add to that the incessant flood of 'special time limited offers' that offer exactly the same thing each month at a 'never to be repeated price' and the fact that you have to pay for tutorials from their site, and it's just all round bollocks.<br><br>So my new rule of thumb is 'don't believe the hype!' and read the forums and see what people are griping about.

In case you ale looking for some tool you may scroll through all usable tools in the tool list. Here you have currently used icon and description of the tool. In case tool has assigned a hot key the used hot key is visible in the Assigned Hot Keys section. Here you may assign, remove or change the hot key. To open Icon Helper just click on 	   icon or mouse hovering over a tool and pressing Ctrl-F1 brings up the Icon Helper panel with the selected tool highlighted.<br>			<br>Category: The category combo box allows you to choose a category of tools. There are two special categories: Options and Hot Keys. Option category includes all check boxes and radio buttons. But in case you select for example “Primitives” category you will see there options related to primitives too. Hot Keys category shows all tools and options with assigned Hot Keys.<br><br>•	Find Text: Click on the opens Find text dialog that allows find tool by given text.<br><br>•	Inspect Tool: Click on the button starts inspect mode. Cursor is changed and you may click on any button in user interface. The clicked button became selected in the list box. Right click stops inspect mode.<br><br>•	Find Tool:This button allows you to localize tool in interface. (Not fully implemented yet.) When you click on this button short animation shows you where the tool or option button is housed. (Do not move mouse during animation because cursor position is changed by program.)<br><br>•	Save Hot Keys:  This button allows you to save list of hot keys in text or HTML format. In the Save As dialog you may set option Save All and list of all tools will be created.  For the HTML format the icons are saved too into subfolder of the folder where file is placed. The subfolder name is created from html file name with suffix “images”. For example you saved the hot key list into file: c:\test\keylist.htm and images are stored in c:\test\keylist_images folder.<br><br>•	Tool list: This list box contain list of all available tools and options.<br><br>•	Assigned Hot Keys: Here you may assign remove or change a hot key.

Manipulating with the new vertex is then like manipulating with all welded vertices at once. The position of the new vertex is the average of all source vertices. Source vertices are those which were selected at time of activating the Weld tool.<br><br>Example of working with the Weld vertices tool: First , two vertices are selected (1st picture), Weld tool is activated (2nd picture) and then another two vertices are selected and welded (3rd picture).  <br><br>Break Mesh Tool<br><br>The Break tool allows you to separate a section of the mesh and manipulate it independently from the rest. By activating this tool, currently selected faces are separated along the edges from the rest of the mesh.<br>Here is a short tutorial illustrating the high level basic concepts on how the UVE can be used to place faces in different places for using or creating a unified texture map.  The object used can be found in the objects library.<br><br>The image below shows model with the different parts pre-colored for mapping purposes.  By applying a planer UV map and selecting just the front faces (a saved selection) you can begin to separate the parts of the mesh for manipulation in the UVE.  You can see the wires in their different colors when you open the UVE.   Among other things this helps keep track of left and right initially.  Note that only the selected faces appear in the display.<br><br><br>Select all the faces and move them over to one side.  Then select all the faces and open the UVE.  Notice that the previous selected faces are still in the position you moved them to when you zoom out.  Note that you can select any group of faces (hands, feet, ears) and map a new UV on them and the change will show up in the UVE where you can move them around.  <br><br>Now that you have single layers of faces to work with you can easily select faces and separate them in the UVE using the “Break Mesh along edges” tool.  This allows you to place them over specific areas of a map or to prepare a map from the wire output to a 2D paint program.  First you paint the faces all one color as you can’t separate across wire colors with this tool.  You do that with direct selection on the model and then open the UVE.  If you have a texture map already created now is a good time to apply it.  <br><br>Now when you open up the UVE you can select a group of faces, break them off, and move them where you want.  Note that your updates display in real time on the model if a texture is applied.<br><br>With the several ways to separate out face selections both on the model and in the UVE, weld faces into combined groups, and apply independent UV to each, any mapping task you are faced with can be handled.<br><br>UV Unwrapper Tool<br><br>Holding ALT key when activating unwrapper tool will allow you to run the process of slicing the object (UV Slice tool) and unwrapping (UV Unwrapper tool) in one step. The process is done on a copy of the object so that only the object’s UV mapping is changed and nothing else. It prevents topology changes caused by UV Slice tool on the original object. This helps especially when unwrapping SDS objects.<br> <br></div> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I have never considered buying TS because of the cost of pluggins. When NAN went under (several months after I bought Publisher) I wanted a package I could get support on and decided LW looked good for me. It's just took me 2 months to get an answer to a support question. So am I going to upgrade to LW8... not a chance! I'd rather spend the *upgrade* cost of LW8 on RealSoft3D... but then Blender is improving quickly now... and is free! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

However though... I believe that the use of the software depends on the individual at hand as I have found many application suit certain individuals accordingly! I have used many app's that I too thought were clumsly and useless for me as well, But then I read others replies about the use of thoes certain applications and found that other users where able to understand &amp; use the software better than I can.. I guess it depends on the persons perception and intake of the software and it's controls and how they relate to you the end user! Some people can use app's that have alot of functions to it..some other users want a more simplfied version of such applications due to there intake of the use of the software.<br>I have been considering of weather or not to purchase GameSpace...But then again...I also have TrueSpace 5 and I was wondering to myself why should I buy gamespace when I already have truespace 5 ?!? However though, I've only been toying around with TrueSpace 5 and 3DSMax and also LightWave 3D 7.0<br>I have been fortunate enough to be able to afford these high-end applications... But in all honesty here.<br>I have been using MilkShape 3D for quite some time now and I like the way MilkShape 3D is!!! It's real dam simple to use and make low-poly models with it for your games.. But I also decided that I wanted to get real good at a professional modeller package and thus got the other 3 to choose which one I want to stick with and learn from.. I worked with all 3 of them and I found that I liked LightWave 3D because it's real similar to that of MilkShape 3D... Where the other's cluster their interface's with hords of unfamilar icons that takes awhile to decipher &amp; figure them out before you can actually use the software to it's maxium potential... LightWave 3D use's plan words on ther tool-buttons.. I like that approch.. Plus anyways..<br>Support for a product is important here..But when you have a vast array of forums &amp; great tutorials to goto... You normally will find most of all your answers already there! So very seldom should you ever really need to go the route of emailing customer support enless you absolutly can't find anything on the support forums or tutorials...<br>Just my two cents worth on that issue..<br>But I have decided that Im' going to learn LightWave 3D for all of my modeling needs.. I hope TrueSpace will improve in time for there customers sake or they will end up losing in the long run towards the others in time...<br><br>P.S.  I really dont care for TrueSpace myself though due to<br>      the impending issues mentioned above as I have<br>      undergone many of the same issues as you guys have to! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In saying that I've got C4D v6 for sale (MAC) if anyone wants it - send me an email...<br><br>Anyhow... I digress... perhaps 6 months ago I was sucked in by one of the sales emails and upgraded to 5.5 (I think it was... that shows you how much I used it) for texture baking etc. I was so wholly unimpressed by how the app had developed, and it's stability - and the seeming stream of pay-to-upgrade emails that followed that I uninstalled... I would have gone fora refund; however fond memories of the past stopped me from doing so..., I used to absolutely love TS3 all those years ago - it's such a shame that they appear to be trying to play catch-up with maya and the like.
