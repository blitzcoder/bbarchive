But still they seem to have there models animations with these certain model formats... I understand that the .3ds doesn't export skeletal animations and all... But does the .3ds export morph target animations instead??? Because like I said above in my post here... Other user's have manage to use these model file formate with their games and such, and managed to have animations with them, So why can't I save a model in this format with all animations in tact then?!? I do also understand as well that most of the users that have managed to do this uses 3D Studio Max for there models... Does this make that difference?<br><br>I basically am just wanting to know if you can save animations with the .3ds model file format &amp; was just curious as to why I can't never seem to save any animations with the .x model file format as well...
