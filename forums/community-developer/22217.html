Does anybody here use it for personal projects or at work? I'd really like a direct comparison between all the major 3D packages, but I realise that's all highly subjective. The main issue with Softimage would probably be the lack of a direct path to .b3d. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It still sounds good, don't get me wrong, but the flagship product (used by all the real pros) is called Softimage XSI and is priced at...<br><br>[deep breath...]<br><br>$13,000 US !!!!!!!!!!<br><br><a href="http://www.archwaysystems.com/archway/prodasftimxsi.htm" target="_blank">http://www.archwaysystems.com/archway/prodasftimxsi.htm</a><br><br>And up!<br><br>AAAAAARRRRGH!<br><br>Or you can 'lease' it for £395 per month!<br><br>Wont be buying that then.<br>Still might think about the other version though. ;)<br><br>If anybody knows where I can get a direct comparison of the 2 products then please let me know. Their site is a bit of a mess TBH - I actually had to find that price from another site. Maybe they don't want to scare anybody, or maybe it's a case of "if you have to ask then you can't afford it"!<br><br>I'd like to see what you get for the extra $11,500. Strangely, I did find an export comparison chart that said the cheap version could export .x files whilst the expensive XSI version could not. Odd.<br><br>It does have a nice sounding ASCII file format called dotXSI, which could probably be used quite easily to get animated stuff into Blitz if .x wasn't good enough for you(and yes, the cheap version supports this too).<br><br><br>Something to think about anyway. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Just to clarify a few things. SoftImage3D and SoftImageXSI are two different packages. SI3D is old (about 15 years or so), and XSI (a couple of years old) is the next generation of SI3D. Basically, SI3D written from the ground up, with totally new design, interface and functionality. I don't know for how long they will keep updating SI3D, they had some big customers using SI3D (like ILM), but most of these have now moved on to XSI.<br><br>Back to SI3D. It's was a great package, at least for film work, but I don't know how good it is for games. The interface is old and takes a while to get you head around, but works fine once you do. The hardware requierments are kind of specific (often requiering high-end graphics cards and specific resolutions). And, as far as I know, there is still no scripting in it (besides plug-ins). The Softimage renderer is not very good, so you would want to use mentalray (which bump the price to $2500 for the SI3D extreme version), and then you also get particles and soft bodies. At that price, maybe you're better of with other tools. Maya Complete costs less.<br><br>I hear Lightwave is good (and there was a .b3d exporter for it...right?).<br><br> Ragnar <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
