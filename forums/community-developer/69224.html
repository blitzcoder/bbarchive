The only reason I'm sometimes temped by C4D is to get Bodypaint with it (I'd *really* love a 3D painting program right about now) but the addons are costly, and the upgrades are costly.<br><br>XSI on the other hand is a fairly self contained program.  What features you get with your version is pretty much the end of the story, and that's nice.  But, XSI doesn't really have upgrades ($100 off the cost of a new version of Foundation- w00t!  A $400 upgrade!) and most of the bug fixes are left for the next version, or for people who have a pro maintenance license.  A very complex program, but a good one all the same... as long as you don't have to have the latest version of your suite every year.<br><br>Modo is cool as well, but it's modelling tools need work.  Combined with something like Silo (or even Wings3D), Modo would rock, unless you need animation.<br><br>Just out of curiosity- what are you looking at using a 3D suite for? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

XSI's kills it dead, except for the lack of pelt mapping... which TS lacks anyway, I believe.<br><br>XSI is superb for animation.  I don't think TS is ever going to get close to XSI in this respect.  I watched some videos of 7.5's animation capabilites, and even though TS has physics on its bones (something XSI Foundation lacks) the rest of the package is just so much stronger.  When you see that the entire rig and model for Godzilla (from the movie) was made and animated in a really old version of XSI (before it was XSI, actually), you realise just how much potential is in the program.  Truespace has a couple of quirky models, and that's about it.  The difference is huge.  Of course, so is the learning curve, so it's best to purchase XSI with training- bundled if possible.<br><br>Modelling in XSI is really, really good.  It lacks a few things I'd like to have, but the rest is so good you forget about those things pretty fast.  Truespace has some good tools (a few XSI could really use, which look great in TS7.5) but TS's toolset is painfully slow to use.  I'd choose XSI over it any day, unless you want to do architecture, and then you'll need to work in a more specific program.  XSI just isn't built for it.  Coupling Silo with any program could be a good choice, but you'll need to check to make sure your pipeline works properly.  Truespace can handle a lot of formats (with a plugin) but XSI lacks support for... well, a lot.<br><br>Vray is good.  If you have it for TS, you're working with a great renderer (if you weren't aware).  XSI's Mental Ray is a production proven renderer and, I think, more flexible than Vray in the looks it can produce.  Vray is typically used for architectural renders, while Mental Ray is used for just about anything.  To get the most out of Mental Ray you'll need to learn about the best way to tweak it, though.  Most people bork at the thought, but learning about rendering is a smart move in my book.  If you want to produce a nice render without much effort, look to Carrara 5.  It's a much better program for producing quick renders which look great, than TS's standard renderer, Lightworks.<br><br>Summing up:  I like XSI a lot.  Everything you really need for game work is contained in one package.  It is with TS as well, but TS is, as I found a while back, really slow to use once you get going.  It's also really thin on proper workflow methodoligies.  XSI forces you to use proper directories, name things as you go, and organise your content!  Also, things like its non-destructive hierarchy and construction modes really do help in the long run.  Truespace is still mostly a toy.<br><br>If you like having fun and keeping things simple, stick with TS.  If you want to get a little more serious and learn a more correct way of working, give XSI a shot.  That's my two cents :D <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you can handle the interface (good luck figuring out animation without proper tutorials!), it'll do what you want for free.  Strong UV mapping, and now has things like renderbaking.<br><br>Lightwave or XSI<br>-More complex, but also much stronger in many areas.
