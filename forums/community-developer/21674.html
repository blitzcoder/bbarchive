I'm at a loss.  I have seen parts export incorrectly but the problem was always easy to fix.

I learned the hard way to always do test exports at every major step (and that certainly includes just before I start animating) and to always Reset XForm immediately every time I mirror anything.  If you work "blind" and just assume it will export correctly at the end you are setting yourself up to have a lot of time and effort wasted. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

By this I mean that the y-axis (for example) becomes a negative y-axis. So regardless of how you then rotate the gizmo its a mirror image of what it should be. This then causes the animation to screw up because it seems that it assumes that axes are a 'constant' thing. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Other mirror problems certainly are because for some reason 3D Studio Max does not render accurately until Reset XForm is applied.  Because the problems are fundamental to the model, such problems are also common to ALL exporting.  You said yourself you tried two separate .x exporters; it being Microsoft's file format one has to assume it is pretty completely tested as file formats/exporting go.  For reference have you tried exporting to 3ds and then viewing that in other apps (Blitz3D, Ultimate Unwrap, etc?)<br><br>Note that mirroring problems aren't limited to Blitz; since I first started using 3D Studio Max, years before I ever even heard of Blitz3D, I've been using Reset XForm to correct that problem.  I really wonder why discreet has never addressed that problem.  It's not just a problem for exporting, it can screw things up within 3D Studio Max too (for example, try doing a boolean involving a mirrored object.)  The trouble mirroring can cause for booleans is why I was first advised to use Reset XForm; somewhat ironically booleans are problematic in so many other ways too that I still avoid them with a vengeance.<br><br>As for hating to kludge around everything you may want to rethink doing 3D modeling.  As I pointed out, when you use 3D Studio Max (or pretty much any other 3D art tool) a lot you get used to doing cleanup steps as you work.  Using Reset XForm after every mirror for example becomes a habit, something you don't even think about and just do.  Other common cleanup steps you may want to get into the habit of doing regularly to ensure the integrity of your model, some specific to 3D Studio Max and some common to all 3D art tools, include STL Check, welding vertices to close cracks, collapsing the modifier stack, test smoothing the model (eg. with MeshSmooth) to see problems in the mesh, and turning edges to even out topology.  If this sounds annoying, well, it is but you just have to get used to it.  Software is flaky and there's not a whole lot you can do about it.  It's just like how you should save and backup your work regularly in case the computer craps out on you.<br><br>****************<br><br>Er, so the point of that lecture was that it is impossible to write a bullet-proof exporter because mirroring problems are due to 3D Studio Max, not the exporter. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It HAS involved deleting all the animation and starting again, but I managed to salvage the model so all is not lost.<br>What I meant by a 'reliable' exporter was simply this : one that gives you TRUE WYSIWYG between Max and Blitz. What annoys me the most is when something works fine in one tool, then completely self-destructs when you export it to another.<br>I had already tried exporting to 3DS as you suggested, and it only infureated me more, because the .3ds file looked FINE when imported back into Max, but was messed up in both UU and Blitz.<br><br>The reason it was all going wrong was because the first frame in my animation wasn't - how can I put this - in a straight line. The character was half way through a running animation on frame 0, which was causing a 'skew' effect to any object that was rotated. This ONLY happened on export however - it was all fine in Max.<br><br>Therefore, I unlinked everything and set the character up in a 'sraight-up standing' pose, applied 'reset x-form' to each object individually, then re-linked everything.<br>This obviously messed with my animations to such an extent that I decided to redo them from scratch.<br><br>So in essence it was all because frame 0 wasn't set properly.<br>And it only took me 10 hours to figure it out!<br>;)<br>Thanks for everybodys help on this, and I hope somebody else can save themselves a days work by reading it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Now delete a couple of faces and put them back in. You know how you always have to build your faces/polys by going through the vertice in an anti-clockwise fashion? Surprise!! Now you have to go through them in a clockwise fashion. Because the mirrored section is now inverted. It just doesn't show that it's inverted until you reset XForm. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

People assume (presumably because it costs so much) that 3D Studio Max is perfect and bug free, when in fact it is one of the most flaky and bug-ridden pieces of software around.  Not to blame discreet mind you; flakiness is inevitable when you are adding features and making changes at the pace they do.  The whole point of my last post was that getting good with a given 3D app is largely about learning to deal with the flakiness, to constantly double check the integrity of the data. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
