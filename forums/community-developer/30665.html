CSG was pulled out because Josh couldn't get it working, and we're probably still waiting for bugs in the CSG to be fixed so that 4.1 can be released. I haven't seen any sign of an importer for CSM 4 files, and there's no B3d export. Looking past all that, I made a test level to see how it was going, and there are problems with the UV mapping as well. Lots of areas of a very simple map just didn't line up any more, whereas they would have done in CS3.<br><br>If Josh can take care of all the problems, it would be a far better choice than Quill, in my opinion, but it's worth hanging on to see if he does. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
