That makes it easier to move items from one menu to another (from your skills-window to the shortcut bar for example, or any item from your inventory).<br><br>That's why I'm choosing BMax + xors3D.<br>According to Xors3D's documentation, MD2 isn't supported.<br>Only B3D is fully supported.<br>.X, .OBJ, .3DS, .FBX and .MS3D are partially supported.<br><br>I guess I'm stuck with the B3D fileformat, as the documentation doesn't describe which features of those other formats are supported.<br><br>I already tried exporting a morph animation using the B3D pipeline, but it attached 9 bones to my mesh (one bone for each vertex).<br>When my modeling skills get a bit higher and I can create a monster mesh (over 5000 vertices), the pipeline would put 5000 bones in my model using the morph-mesh export function.<br><br>I guess the performance would be equal in both cases:<br>- 5000 bones, each with one vertex assigned to it (morph export)<br>- perhaps 10 bones for the entire model, where 500 vertices could be assigned to each bone (regular boned-animation export)<br><br>Also, when using the morph-export function, the model was invisible at first in Xors3D.<br>The model became visible once it started animating.<br><br><br>Isn't there a way to convert to model in 3DS MAX to a mesh, which holds all the morphed frames?<br>Would the B3D fileformat support such vertex animation, without bones?<br>Or does B3D only support boned animations, and therefore, even if 3ds max could convert the animation to vertex animation, Xors3D won't be able to deal with it?<br><br><br><br>I tried putting 1000 of those butterflies on-screen and place the camera further away, so the engine doesn't have to render a screen full of animating butterflies.<br>I still got 28fps.<br><br>In the real game, there will never be such high amounts of animating monsters near the player. I'm only stress-testing some things right now to determine how far I can go.<br>But I'll definately need good performance during some parts of the game, where about 50 monsters are closeby.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
