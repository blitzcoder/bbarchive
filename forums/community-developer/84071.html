Creating my models in 3dsmax. I know how to render the UV template, and I know how to apply the texture. My problem is lining up the texture correctly with the faces.<br><br>For example, when you unwrap the uv mapping, you have a lot of faces/polys laid out. I can't figure out any good way to apply a texture map other than trial and error and chopping a texture into pieces to see if it lines up properly. Here is an image detailing my delimma:<br><br><img src="http://i43.tinypic.com/28b9wd1.jpg"><br><br>As you can see, in the left window, I have a simple model with the front of the chest selected. In the corresponding uv template window, obviously these faces do not line up. So, I'm having difficulties creating textures for the front of the chest in this example.<br><br>Is it a matter of me not unwrapping the template correctly? Or is this really the only way to do it? I can't imagine there is not a better way, or there is something I'm not doing correctly, because this seems like a really complicated method to create textures. And this model is very basic. For a high poly model, this would be a nightmare.<br><br>I tried the Ultimate Unwrap3D demo, but I'm still having the same issues.<br><br>Any help or advice is appreciated! Thank you. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You'll need to do a uniform resize in there, too, as the selection will take up maximum space in the UVW map and you probably don't want that.<br><br>The other way is to select all the faces (CTRL+A), click Edit, Mapping, Flatten Mapping.

You can use those basic wrapping modes, line planar, cylindric etc., but you need to know what type of mesh needs what type of wrapping. EG you may want to flip and combine mirrored things like two legs, arms, or the left side of the characters face to the right side, or the 4 wheels of a vehicle... So you will do a lot of rotation, moving, scaling and welding of UV.<br><br>If the wrapping is done, you should export the UVs on a bitmap. This is going to help you a lot as a blended layer in your graphics app, where you paint the texture. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
