Find out which one suits you. Not sure either do animation off the top of my head.<br><br>Personally I use milkshape, but it's not free. That said, it's so cheap it's as good as free.<br><br>And even then you're probably going to have to spend a couple of quid on Ulitmate Unwrap for texture mapping. And then a few more pennies on a paint package to draw them with.<br><br>A general rule of thumb is you get what you pay for. Free software generally isn't as good, fully featured or as well suppored as software you pay for, obviously this isn't always the case. And sometimes the free software is nearly as good as it's commerical counterpart so it makes buying commerical software a difficult justification.<br><br>That all said, software, like so many things is subjective. Download the free stuff, download demos of commerical, try them out and see what suits you. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So if you've got the time to learn a language you've probably got the time to learn how to do some basic modeling. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
