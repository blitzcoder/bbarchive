LW on the Amiga and Poweranimator on Irix just weren't large targets for the hacking community - you had to own the hardware. additionally, games on PC's took off so it's no wonder 3DStudio became the tool of choice there.<br><br>Newtek moved Lightwave over to the PC because the Amiga died. Alias moved Poweranimator and Studio over to the PC because MS ported SoftImage over and PC's were overtaking SGI boxes in the bang-for-buck category - they had to stay competitive. That both packages started getting pirated only makes sense. They were on PC's running under Windows!<br><br>as for interface, LW's has definitely been in a class all it's own and evolved over many years. and Maya's interface is an evolution of Studio's which most definitely didn't look to 3DStudio for inspiration. in fact, does 3DStudio even have the floating toolbox menus tied to the cursor/Spacebar like Maya? i haven't seen any app do that. and that's straight from Studio.<br><br>the one thing i think 3DStudio did that caught on was promoting plug-in architecture. that extensibility was a nice move. but it has drawbacks. lots of people don't like having to learn a slightly different interface for a plug-in. not sure how LW is handling that stuff, but Maya has leap-frogged that with it's Mel scripting. lots of studios make a decision to go with Maya because of Mel.<br><br>not saying handing out unprotected software hasn't happened. i've seen it with SolidWorks when they started competing with Pro/Engineer. but i doubt 3DStudio was handed out for free back then - they had no competitors on the PC to take market share away from. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
