You could argue that more levels are made in Hammer (or similar) map tools than Max, but you aren't gonna rush out and use them, cos they aren't made for Blitz.  Quill works in the same way as these tools, and is made for Blitz.  It really depends on what sort of map you want to make, but having tried to use Max to make levels, I don't recommend it much.  It's quite difficult keeping the texture mapping under control and navigating around the inside of tight spaces.<br><br>CodeD - ignore what you saw in Quill so far, it sounds like you were in the mesh editor and not the map editor.  They are very different tools.  The mesh editor is fine if you have never used anything better/pricier, but the map editor is where you will the difference will shine.  Don't forget you get occlusion code/export with Quill as well.<br><br>I've also tried CShop, and it does have some neat tricks, but mostly I've found it to be buggy, underpowered and has an anti-user philosophy (in my opinion).<br><br>In summary, I don't think the best map editor exists yet for Blitz, but out of all those that do I rate Quill most highly.  If you can get on with Max then use that, it is a great tool, but it won't be the complete answer: issues with lightmapping, slicing-up and occlusion will haunt you. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You can include stuff like physics, particles, my door entities, parametes galore from CShop prefabs/parameters, straight into the Singularity Engine - written in b3d.<br><br>But you will need to get your head around the engine itself - not too difficult but as it is still in development, it is likely to change (and does often), so keeping up can be a task!  <br><br>On the other hand I was able to develop door entities to control doors opening, closing, keys and locks with just a few days programming.  These are avaialable as prefabs you just drop them into your map and configure your setting - very very easy.  <br><br>You can export .X and lightmaps (which is cool), and CShop 4.0 is much much much better than 3.x for stability and user friendliness - You can go fullscreen with any viewport for a start!  CSG and Carve are back but with some bugs I believe.<br><br>But there is no b3d export currently - and from what Josh has said I would guess it is not too likely to be there any time soon.<br><br>So again, this may not be the best solution.<br><br><br><br>To do Cutting stuff in Max is pretty easy.<br><br>Make a box, make a sphere.

But as I keep saying - he has already bought MAX!!<br><br>Why bother with anything else?<br><br>The great thing about what Max and other tools like it offer is exportability to specialist engines.  I have a friend who uses Max exclusively, for games, films, television, goverment and agency work!  <br><br>He and his colleagues worked on all the WRC games for PS2 at Evolution.  <br><br>Whatever the good or bad points about Quill 3D and CShop and Maplet these are not the tools which the pros are using.  Max, Maya, Lightwave are.<br><br>We aspire to be games designers of the best calibre we are able to be... if we have access to Max should'nt it be the choice over the other less capable products?<br><br>Enough of this chatter... :)<br><br>Coded should choose the 'weapon' of his choice and go with it, be it Quill or CShop or Maplet or whatever.<br><br>I kinda wonder why the question wasn't asked before he bought Max...could have saved a lot of questions! :)<br><br>Coded?  <br><br>Did you purchase Max because it was a good price, because you knew it was a great tool to use - or that you thought it was the best for the job?  Did you not think that before you spent all that hard earned dosh on Max that you should check out the other products for level design first? <br><br>Or are you just japing with us?<br><br>:)<br><br>IPete2.<br><br>Hey Coded, I just had a thought!  I'll swap you my origianl copy of Quill3D for your original copy of Max 6.0! lol. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Well, I got max because I wanted to learn the industry standard. I'm started to get familiar with it and since this post have managed to make some levels but, the problem I'm having is with walk-thru mode.  Where is it?<br>I mean I've made basically a hollowed out box using boolean subtract and i can zoom the view in and out but, i can't figure out how to get to or if there is a walk-thru mode like most level editors or if i need to get some sort of plugin for this.  And I could use some prefabs, too!!<br>And my one other question is, is it possible to make entities in 3d max like moving doors or spawn points and stuff like that to interact with a program, does the b3d pipeline export that kind of stuff? And does the b3d pipeline export the lightmaps as well??? I've got it installed already I'm just not sure if I'm doing this stuff right.<br>But, for now I've called off pitchin' in for another app. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Group it and save it all off as a Max file and a B3d file.<br><br>Make a door in your level, texture it<br><br>Select the grouped level and delete it, leaving just your door or doors in place.<br><br>Animate the door opening by clicking the 'Auto Key' near the centre of the screen at the bottom.

Turn auto key off.<br><br>Export the door as a max file and a b3d file.<br><br>Load both into B3d separately, do not position either, they will both centre up automatically and be in the correct place.<br><br>set up the door mesh to animate in b3d.<br><br>animate it opening and then reverse the animation so it closes.<br><br>Voila.<br><br>Good luck <br>IPete2. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
