You make it sound like no other modeling tools allow you to directly control vertices, when in fact EVERY modeling tool supports that (requires it, really.)  Well, I suppose "every" is too strong a word; I can think of maybe two modeling tools which aren't based on/don't allow direct manipulation of vertices, neither of which I've seen mentioned on this forum.  Direct manipulation of vertices is the most basic modeling method, a task fundamentally inherent in just about every modeling tool I've ever used or seen.<br><br>Saying Milkshape is better than Wings3D (or whatever) because it allows direct manipulation of vertices is kind of like saying Volvos are better than Toyotas because they have wheels.<br><br>***<br><br>"partly because I'm a control freak and I simply have to position all my vertices manually."<br><br>Here again, you make it sound like Milkshape is the only tool you can do this in.

It's not the ability to move vertices around; it's the fact that you HAVE to place all your vertices that I like. If, for example, I want to limit a model to 200 polys (because there may be 100 of them on the screen at once), Milkshape gives me the ability to toss something together from scratch without having to think too hard about LoD. Add in some tricks of the trade and you can make pretty detailed models with very few polys.<br><br>Wings3D is great too, but it's a modeler with a different purpose. I have it and use it when poly count isn't that important. For that matter, Art of Illusion is another cool modeler with booleans, so I use THAT when I need booleans. :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Nendo (and it's 'big-brother' Mirai) was built by Nichimen specificly with low-poly charcter design in mind and the interface is adapted for this. At the time (we are talking late 90's here) the interface was very cutting edge, quite unlike any of the other tools around at the time.
