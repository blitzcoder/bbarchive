One is an engine while the other's a programming language. 3DGS has got a built-in scripting language. The scripting allows you to do many things, but you'll soon hit the wall if you try anything else than 3D games, and then preferably FPS's. It's got it's own level editor(crap) and model editor(an insult). Overall, it's quite decent for making fps games quick and dirty, but it's got a high price tag and some real ugly licensing terms(gotta splash 'made with 3D gamestudio' all over your product etc). Okay for prototyping but not much else IMO. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I was even involved with developing a fishing game which is being sold in Walmart (I was the animator on the project.)  It was fairly easy to use but pretty limiting.  If you want to hear reasons then look at old threads, in General Discussion especially, because this exact discussion/argument has raged many times before, but long story short I use Blitz3D now because I much prefer it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Blitz is a great language and easy to use. I prefer B3D over A6 for two reasons.<br><br>1. Its easy and fun to use<br>2. The BB3D Community is nicer then A6, less jerks here then A6, they turn into flamers very fast, not all but alot. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I like 3dGS better than BB3d. It's not that either one is really better than the other it's just I feel more comfortable with 3dGS. I like it's capabilities and I like what's already been done for you. You can use 3dGS for any type of project you want. The language currently doesn't support com programming but it will soon. An ANSI C version of c-script is already in the latest beta release for 3dGS. The number of features is growing very quickly in 3dGS. Every time there is a new beta released the number of new features takes me a long time to read through. Currently the beta page for 3dGS is around 26 pages long. The previous new features page that made it into the manual from version 6.2 is 40 pages long. <br><br>There really is a great deal of development for 3dGS. And each of the releases makes my job easier and the number of creative possibilities I have grow dramaticaly.<br><br>Ok. Enough rambling from me. The best thing you can do is to just check out the free demos from each of the development systems you're interested in. Also read the forums to see what issues people are having with the software, read up on what type of support is available for these systems. Also try to find comercial games that were developed with the studios you're interested in.<br><br>Good luck in choosing,<br><br>Ben <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
