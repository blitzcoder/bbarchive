IE: When you want a character to run and shoot at the same time, you might have the bottom half of the body play a run animation and the top half of the body play a shooting animation. Now I'm fairly ok with modelling, but animation in Max is still mostly all Greek to me, but this seems like something it can probably do. I'm just not sure how, what feature I should be looking at or what term I should be googling.<br><br>Any help anyone can give - even if it's just the name of the feature I need to be googling - would be much appreciated. A link to a tutorial on the subject would be even better. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I know it can be a code thing, but it's a pointless overhead to do it in realtime when I only need it for a handful of animations.

Well when I google that for 3dsMax I seem to be getting a lot of hits mentioning Motion Flow and Motion Mixer. There's not much information, just those features, so I think I'll have a play with Max and see if either of them looks like it can do what I want.<br><br>Yeah, it's a shame I'm not using Blitz3D or I could just use Blender for these animations and be done with it.

They integrated all the good ones in order to keep the higher price somewhat valid. So you get character studio, mental ray, plus they bought up and integrated many of the more usefull plugins that used to be third party e.g. Power booleans. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
