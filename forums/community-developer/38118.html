The level modelers get to do a lot of custom textures of course, but it certainly helps get the overall look and feel of a game down. <br><br>the smallest place I worked, we all did our own textures, and things would often bog down. At the place where we had 1 artist per environment type and a master texture artist things went pretty well, but we all had to get time with the guy to explain what we wanted the look of the level to be, and hope he understood. But it worked pretty well once we had are coupl eof dozen base textures.<br><br>Another place had 1 level designer, for the entire game, and the game levels split into 6 pairs consisting of 1 texture artist and one modeler.<br><br>Usually they did all the vehicles, characters for their level too.<br><br>Anyway, in my experience 1 good dedicated texture artist goes a long way and things move a along at a good pace.<br><br>Once we have money and leadfoot decided to get another artist, I think we'd probably end up trying for a good web designer and 2D texture artist who we might train into some 3D work as things develop. We allreday have a really nice game concept but at the moment its a bit too ambitious for a 2 man, low income team lol. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But there are a considerable amount of shortcuts that lower the final quality of the graphics in the game.<br><br>I'd rather model a few more features and work on better shadows over curved surfaces. There's all kinds of weirdness in dooms shadows, and some other games have actually done better in the realtime animated shadow department. I personally prefer to use optimized geometry than going overboard with the bump maps, and really don't see the need for these millions of poly models except to sound good. I doubt anyone could really tell the difference between a 50k - 70k poly character, and these. I wouldn't be surprised if they used splines or nurbs and turned up the subdivisions, to come up with crazy poly numbers with which to impress the media.<br><br>Still, it is cool that these kinds of games are being done, it's not 10 years since I first got interested in 3D rendered characters, and these are better than what was around back then.<br><br>3dsmax can allready create your FX shaders, and this is supposed to have been improved a lot in Max 7, in 5 years time, I expect we will be creating materials the same way you might for a pre rendered scene in your favurite 3D app.<br><br>Pretty cool really. you should be able to do a lot of that now, if the hardware is taking over the lighting and shadows, working with simple diffuse textures becomes a lot easier.<br><br>Anyway, I've started rambling, but things are looking like they should be fun in the future, and I don't think it will be too long that smaller devs like ourselves can make use of this kind of tech. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Either that or rely on the coder to code each multipass rendered surface. I see shaders as a nice way to give the developers freedom, without long convoluted workarounds using regular techniques that are very time consuming and inpractical to implement.<br><br>easy layered masking may not sound cool to a coder, but for an artist its a feature that enables them to produce AAA quality visuals without a lot of effort. It may still require 2 or even 3 passes in hardware and in effect double the actual rendered geometry, but its a damn sight easier to have that done automatically than have to do it all in code, or model duplicate geometry, and pray that every poly is in the exact same work space to avoid sorting.<br><br>I'm sure a lot of people will never use the most fancy shaders done in PS2, it's overkill and the work required to implement them will be seen by a minority, when you shoudl be trying to support the best features the majority of people can enjoy.<br><br>Anyway, your engine ovbiously does shader 1.1 so its not a problem, but most people using 2.0 will probably be the usual tech demo creators, not those trying to make commercial quality games for a broad demographic.<br><br>Hopefully if Vivid does well, there will be some 3rd party exporters created with it, that allow non coders and non blitz owners developing blitz games to make good use of it.<br><br>anyway, look forward to seeing some good graphics demo's for your product. I'm hoping pudding supports Bmax as well as he has Blitz3D, in which case I'll stick to the bmax rendering engine, as the way pipeline works allows a max user like me to throw together animated, 3D, or 2D in 3D UI's in a couple of hours and experiment with most of what blitz has to offer and get the look I want eithout any coding whatsoever. I also don't have to rely on the coder to understand the look I'm trying to get in my artwork. Which can sometimes be a real pain if your relying one someone to code a lot of effects for you, and leaving you powerless to tweak them and experiment.<br><br>Kind of like the glows and blooms in FMC.<br><br>I shoudl probably read my post but I have to take off, if it sounds overly critical, it wasn't meant to sorry. Really hope it is a big success :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Meanwhile, good art direction produces graphics that look good years after something that was bleeding edge becomes dated.<br><br>E.g. Darkstone -- an old DX5 game -- used stylized character designs, painterly texture maps, and vertex mapped lighting. It still looks great today (not bleeding edge, but great). Vagrant Story, an old PlayStation game, which used nearly monochromatic "pencilled" texture maps still looks amazing by today's standards. OTOH a lot of more "realistic" games of similar or lesser vintage (e.g. Soldier of Fortune or Deus Ex) look like crap today -- striving for realism and failing to get it just gives your game a shorter shelf life.<br><br>By the same token, I think World of Warcraft will look good five years from now (good art direction) while EverQuest never looked good and neither will EQ2. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Bump maps make a huge difference to my eyes.  I can always see the light reflecting in every little crevace and just because some game has nice textures doesn't really do it for me ... nice textures still look flat and lifeless, like a page out of a magazine ... whereas even an ugly bumpmapped texture has depth and looks more 'real' to me.  <br><br>Textures just don't really do it no matter how detailed they are, they're always just kinda dead compared to bumps.  They are a better artistic acheivement sure ... but when I'm playing Halo I notice the bumps a lot because laser fire increases the detail in the texture when it goes by.  A regular texture doesn't change it just kinda lights up ... you don't see more detail.  <br><br>In real life when something lights up in all the cracks you see more detail ... you get a broader picture of what's really there which is intriguing.  With bumpmaps you get a similar effect, like a mystery being uncovered as the light passes over it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
