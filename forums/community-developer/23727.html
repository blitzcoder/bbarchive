A material's color property is really defined by it diffuse color, not ambient.  Try defining color with the DIFFUSE button. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

(for taking one shape away from another)<br><br>And as for the texturing.. best I find an easy to understand tutorial site. ;)<br><br>Anyways, thanks for the above help. I was trying to find a decent/cheap editor that can texture and animate. Tried all the recommendations on other threads - wings is nice, but cant texture.<br><br>Truespace is just too strange !.<br>Draw3d - is too basic.<br>Amapi - take too long to learn.<br><br>oh well.. guess I'll keep on with MS. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'm guessing you've only tried left-clicking.<br><br>Milkshape does not have boolean operations.  It's just as well really; even when booleans are available (eg. in 3D Studio Max) I prefer not to use them because they tend to create all sorts of errors and fugly polygons.  If you want to create a hole in an object just cut polygons and arrange faces in the shape of the hole and then extrude the shape down.<br><br>That Wings can't texture isn't a huge deal actually.  I do most of my texturing in Ultimate Unwrap, even if the tool I used for modeling has texturing tools.  Similarly I use another tool, CharacterFX, for animation.  The irony is that I do use Milkshape a lot but NOT for modeling, texturing, or animation.  I rig my characters in Milkshape (ie. create a skeleton and attach vertices) to export to CharacterFX via Milkshape ASCII. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Milkshape for example is technically an all in one solution for creating low pol characters.  However it isn't really ideal for any task, it is just servicable at all tasks.  If you want an ideally suited tool for every task you will need to pick up several different tools.  Or purchase an expensive tool like 3D Studio Max or Maya; there's a reason those tools cost more, they're good at everything.<br><br>As for needing to try various tools, that is always how it is no matter what you are doing.  I assume you tried various game dev systems before purchasing Blitz. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'm just feeling too lazy/impatient at the mo' to learn to use new apps before I can start creating stuff. After 20 years of programming, on-and-off, there's still so much to do and learn - when will it ever end? Well, never probably. :)<br><br>Anyway, I think I'll start by giving Milkshape a go soon.<br><br>BTW, I actually didn't try any other game dev systems before getting B3D. I bought it solely on someone's recommendation - I didn't even try the demo version. Again, that's prolly just me being lazy. :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
