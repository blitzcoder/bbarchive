I recently purchased a gamespace license from a very good friend of mine that was using gamespace to help create the media content that Me &amp; another friend of mine needs in order to finish our game currently in development! Since I recieved it, I have found gamespace extremely easy to model with! The UI is very well put together, And it's very straight forward indeed. I downloaded some of the tutorials from the gamespace website, And after watching their video tutorials and also going through the tutorials that came with the package, And also the user's manual, I have already managed to model some very interesting things already with it! I've tried the other caligari products from the past, And I found them at that moment very difficult &amp; confusing, And I was very skeptical at trying out gamespace since it's UI follows in the same footsteps as the previous incarnations of TrueSpace! I changed my mind after giving it enough thought to realize that my very good friend and freelancer "Lucid" here in the blitz forums, Managed to create some very impressive models with it! I explained to lucid about my past experience with the other truespace products from caligari, And he explained to me that the UI was extremely easy, And that anybody could model with it if they spend a little time to actually learn it! So I downloaded gamespace Lite, And I gave it a try to see if anything was different about it compaired to the other truespace products.. After watching the video tutorials &amp; going through the tutorials on their website, I was amazed at how easy gamespace was to actually model in!!! It just took me a little time to go through the tutorials to actually learn their UI! Once I got a grasp of the UI of gamespace, I was able to do alot of things that before I couldn't do! I also realized now that I could actually re-install TrueSpace 5.5 again and probably manage to actually use it this time around with my new knowledge I've obtained now! Thank's to my good friend Lucid who helped me understand how good a product gamespace actually is, I can now use it for my low-poly modeling, And use TrueSpace 5.5 for my higher end modeling! I hope that there is other people on here that managed to realize the ease of use of gamespace. I guess this thread might bring forth some interesting results huh?! Let's watch &amp; see! ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

A noob 3d modeller really but I put in some time to learn the main Gamespace icons and UI and it really just took a day or two of study to make it feel pretty comfortable.  But recently I went back to using Wings3d for pure modelling.  Gamespace for me is good for texturing, animation, and exporting but I hit some problems trying to cleanup some bad geometry and putz with some small details.  And I've had display problems when zooming in close to geometry, where the shading gets offset from the actual wireframe model.  I do need to hit the Caligari forums and see if anyone else is getting this shading offset in the display.<br><br>Overall though I think Gamespace is a great product for game modelling and a very good value.  I'm using it now to export DTS format models to the Torque engine.<br><br>Paul <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

With hiarchical animation you move/rotate individual meshes in relation to each other (their children and parents) for example:<br><br>For example to animate a "boned" arm waving all you need to do is draw the arm, stick a skeleton inside it and move the skeleton.  But to make a "hiarchical" arm wave you'd have to draw the arm, then cut it in to pieces (like forearm, elbow, upper arm) and then rotate/move the relative pieces.  This means that with hiarchical animation it is very hard to make organic things look realisted as it difficult to disguise the fact that your arm is in reality 3+ different objects.<br><br>Hope that makes some sense, and yes you can do hiarchical animation in GameSpace <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
