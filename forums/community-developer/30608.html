I'd also like to know how to optimize models so that redundant tris/quads/verts etc. get removed as wings3D seems to place edges where they dont appear to be needed, if you see what I mean.<br><br>Thanks in advance! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But there are a few issues that you need to be aware of.<br><br>1. When wings exports .3ds it uses the formats native orientation of the axis, thus giving you the effect of the model being rotated 90 degrees. You can of course rotate the model correspondingly in wings before exporting it but find it to be much better to use the LoaderMatrix() command to reorient the axis. Add this line to your code (before loading the .3ds files). It should do the trick:<br><br>LoaderMatrix "3ds",1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1<br><br>The LoaderMatrix command tells Blitz3D how it should load objects of a certain type (in this case "3ds") based on a matrix. (If you don't know what matrices are, don't worry. You can read up on it eventually :) It's a good thing to know if you plan on working in 3D.) Note that all .3ds files you load after using this command will be loaded with this matrix transformation<br><br>2. Hmmm...You say that you have problems with normals facing the wrong way and stuff. This is strange since I have never ever had a normal problem when using wings/Blitz3D. It's one of the things that I really like about wings. It handles normal problems beatifully. So I'm afraid that the culprit in this case is your modelling. You mention that you are new to 3D-modelling and this might be the answer. It is quite possible (in any 3D modelling app) to create objects whith normal problems. Here are a few things you can check in wings<br><br>Check the edges of the object. make sure that all vertices that should be conected really are.<br><br>You could also chose to triangulate the object to find problem faces in your model.<br><br>Watch out when extruding! If you are extruding multiple adjacent faces, use 'Extrude Region' and not 'Extrude', since this will result in the extrusion of faces on all edges on all of the faces being extruded, i.e. you will have faces 'inside' the model which are not visible but that still are there and will cause problems since the occupy the same space but with different normals  <br><br>I really think the problem is with the model, not the exporter (although you might not see it in wings without actually knowing  what to look for...)<br><br>If you like I can take a look on your models to se if I can spot any potential problems with them...<br><br>Hope this helps!<br><br>PetBom <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Solved that problem. :)<br><br>Glad to hear you dont get normal problems with wings as this means its almost certainly something Im doing wrong, being a novice to 3D modeling.<br><br>The model Im having problems with is the doghouse one from the manual. I checked all the normals in wings and they're fine. Unfortunately, it's no so easy to check them in B3D. :( Maybe it's because the model is being displayed using smooth shading that's the problem as the doghouse is almost entirely composed of right angles and so doesn't look too good!? Displaying using flat shading is even worse as B3D can't do that too well.<br><br>Anyway, I'll have another play and see what happens. Thanks again! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
