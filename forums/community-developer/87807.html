I use this for modelling and Animation. Has a highly customizable user interface and good modelling, UV unwrapping tools and reasonable 3D Paint tools that can use photoshop plugins and brushes. The down side is the lack of free tutorials and file exporters. I get round the file export problem by exporting to the fbx format and using FragMOTION.<br>Edit: Getting animated files from C4D to B3D can be a complete pain when using FragMOTION. I am now using Ultimate Unwrap3D Pro 3.x (see below) which tends to be less hassle.<br><br>ZBrush (WIN/OSX) - Price $595. Is a model sculpting and painting apllication. I use this for adding texture details (normal maps etc) and modelling organic forms. The interface can be a little weird but not as bad as blenders.<br><br>FragMOTION (WIN) - Price $50 - This can be use for Character rigging and Animation as well and UV unwrapping. I use this mostly for for converting file from fbx to B3D/DBO.<br>Edit: Getting animated files from C4D to B3D can be a complete pain when using FragMOTION. I am now using Ultimate Unwrap3D Pro 3.x (see below) which tends to be less hassle.<br><br> <br>Photoshop CS4 Extended (WIN/OSX) - Price $999 - I use this for lots of things from editing textures and painting directly onto 3D Models.<br><br>Genetica 3.0 Studio (WIN) - Price Starts at $109 for the Basic version - This is a node based procedual texture creation tool.<br><br>The GIMP (WIN/OSX/LINUX) - Price Free. A cross platform image editing too.<br><br>Paint Shop Pro (WIN) - Price $39.99 (was $99.99). A Poor mans Photoshop.<br><br>Blender (WIN/OSX/LINUX) - Price Free. A Cross platform Modelling, UV unwrapping and animation tool. Down side to this tool is the ****** interface.<br><br>xNormal (WIN) - Price Free.  xNormal is an application to generate normal / ambient occlusion / displacement maps. <br><br>Texture Maker 3.1 (WIN) - Price starts at €29.95+VAT. A nice seamless texture creation tool. There are a few of down sides to this tool and thats...<br> 1) It hasn't been updated since 2007.<br> 2) There's been no word from the author for sometime and no known support as the forum as been spammed to death.<br> 3) After you have purchessed you can download the license key with any web browser that doesn't have the words Internet Explorer 8 (it's a case of copy the URL link into Fire Fox).<br><br>AC3D (WIN/OSX/LINUX) - Price $79.95. A cross platform Modeller with UV unwrapping.<br><br>3DCanvas (WIN) - Price Free/$34.95(plus)/$69.95. A modelling and animation tool.<br><br>Ultimate Unwrap3D Pro (WIN) - Price $59.95 A tool for unwrapping Model UV's.<br>Edit: Getting animated files from C4D to B3D can be a complete pain when using FragMOTION.

Modo is a good alternative and is more affordable ($995). (Cinema4D might also be a good alternative, but I don't like it personally)<br><br>Silo 2 (from nevercenter) is very good for pure polygon/subd modeling, I use this to create my basic shapes and tweaking low polygon models. It's also very affordable ($159), but has no animation or rendering features. <br><br>I use ZBrush for high detail modeling, texturing/painting and texture baking. There is really nothing like ZBrush to be honest, I tried Mudbox and 3D coat, they just didn't cut it. ZBrush is also not a complete 3D 'studio' solution, perhaps not suited for all round modeling and animation, but in my opinion for 'organic' modeling (characters, animals, nature), and detailing and texturing models nothing comes close. It's also very well adapted to work with a pen/tablet.<br><br>Blender is great, but the problem with blender is that it does everything different, and not just user interface, also it's output often requires extra work to fit into a 'normal' workflow. My tools should be as unobtrusive as possible, and blender definitely isn't. They really need to stop with the attitude and get with the program because technically and feature wise the software is outstanding and completely free! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I remember having this problem or something similar and if I remember it turned out that I didn't use the alined joint tool before I did a IK chain as converting to FBX turns the joints into bones and throws the bone Axis out if you don't do the aline which can be a b**ch as you have to redo the vertex weights from scratch.<br><br>One thing to remember is that the exporter was broken in C4D R10 ( I think it was fixed in 10.5 ) and if your using a version of C4D that supports FXB2010 then don't export in that format use the FBX 5/6 exporter as fragmotion crashes otherwise.<br><br>And it also worth remembering that if your using Null Objects as controllers you also have to keyframe all the joint positions as well or you'll just be animating the Null Objects.<br><br>I have found out that Ultimate Unwrap 3.x may be a better solution as I've used this to successfully convert a directX file ( it was a bandit model off The Game Creators Store ) into a FBX that was then imported into C4D and it looks like it can handle FBX 2010 reasonably well.<br><br><div class="quote"> I love cinema4d but its not ment for games so no nice workflow or exporter functions. <br></div><br>C4D isn't a popular modeler in the games profession but it is used in the film/tv industry ( BodyPaint3D more so ) and if you want to export a model to another format then you have to write your own exporter and I would think a lot of software developers do.<br>I do believe that C4D is being successfully used with Unity ( into format FBX ). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I have tested a complex rigged bipedal model that I got off one of the Ciniversity tutorials (Taquito the wrestler the scene has 382 objects virtually all controllers/joints and a mesh that's got 3024 polygons), animated a run cycle just by using controller objects then exported it using FBX 2010.2 ( this can handle models created with joints and skins ). I then exported the model from UU3D into  B3D format, then check to see if Fragmotion could load it. It did and animates correctly.<br><br>EDIT: Looks like the FBX exporter still has issues. I was playing around with the XNA skinning sample. The model will import correctly into C4D, but the export (FBX 2010.2) distorts the skeleton and a few frames which is strange are when the file is reloaded into C4D it's normal. I found out I could get round this by first exporting the model as a Collada and using Ultimate Unwrap 3D (currently using 3.23 with 3.22plugins).<br>I think some of the problems with FBX are due to the fact that Fragmotion/UU3D/XNA and many other SDK's are using FBX 5/6 which is a problem for C4D as the FBX 5/6 exporter cannot export joints. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
