(see <a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=84977#962246" target="_blank">http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=84977#962246</a> ). But it´s kind of slow because you need one mesh for each layer and you´ll need to blend them with vertexalpha. It´s ok for small maps, though.<br><br>The best way would be to use FastExt and blend the textures with an alphamap. Pro: fast, Con: restricted to only 4 textures ( +1 lightmap + 3 alphamaps = 8 textures ). Here is a little video of an application i made with b3d + fastext... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b-YT8Rv4xw" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b-YT8Rv4xw</a> (hiatus;)<br><br>Or you could even switch to a dx9 engine (e.g. Xors3d) and do all the magical work with a shader. Probably the hardest method but also the best! Btw. Xors3d is also capable of doing the fastext texblend thingy...<br><br>cheers, chi <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Actually I am using Xors3d, I love it.<br><br>That thread appears to be only for using vertex paint to paint an alpha channel.<br>That's very useful, and I followed the steps and was able to achieve it.<br><br>I'm not really sure what you mean by using FastExt to blend the textures with an alphamap.<br>And I really have no idea how to use shaders yet with Xors3d.<br><br>However, I did get an idea from reading your post. I don't see why it wouldn't be possible<br>to create my map as normal, and for blended textures such as roads in the picture above,<br>I could create a new mesh and vertex paint the alpha onto it, so it would blend with<br>the texture below it. I'm guessing if I did that, I would also have to raise up the mesh a<br>fraction so I wouldn't get artifacting from both meshes being in the exact same place, but<br>if it works then it works.<br><br>But the video you posted is exactly what I am trying to do, except I'm trying to do<br>it in 3ds max. Is there no way to accomplish that in 3ds max with the b3d pipeline? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

My only concern is making it compatible for .b3d exporting, because it <br>seems that B3d Pipeline only works with Blitz3D Brush material and Blitz3D Map. I've tried using <br>blend, mix, and composite materials and they all work when rendered, but simply wont export.<br>So I'll look up some tutorials on how to texture splat with 3ds max, and then figure out what<br>I need to do in the code to get it working.<br><br>Worst case, I suppose I could always separate parts of terrain that need blended textures, and then manually<br>blend them in photoshop, and finally UV map them (would be a pain in the ass, though).<br><br>I really didn't think it'd be so complex though. I remember way back in the day of modding C&amp;C Renegade, I <br>would use Gmax and it had a custom material editor where I could blend textures just by simple vertex painting.<br><br>Thanks again guys =D <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
