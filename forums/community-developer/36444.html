It's very common to see demos with beautiful but strangely unpopulated environments, or with only a few stiff animations. How can indy developers be expected to create these? Animation tools are expensive, hard to use, and take many hours to get quality results. That was until Character Shop.<br><br><img src="http://charactershop.thegamecreators.com/g/charshop/schematic.jpg"><br><br><b>Fully Animate your Models</b><br>Character Shop is the solution to this long-standing difficulty. The program contains 80+ professionally produced animations that can be applied to any humanoid mesh scaled to the fit the skeleton. This means you don't have to do any of the animation work yourself - it has already been done for you by professionals. You simply rig the skeleton to your models and save the end results. The vertex weighing process is straightforward, with powerful selection tools to reach every nook and crevice. Use the auto-attachment feature, then view the mesh deformation in real time and make final adjustments to the vertices.<br><br><b>Natural Fluid Animations</b><br>Even inexperienced users can produce fluent, natural animated models in minutes. Professional animators will find this tool helpful for quickly processing many character meshes on a single set of standard animations. Stop using placeholders or waiting for an artist to help, and make your own fully animated character.<br><br><b>Features:</b><br>-Produce high-quality animated characters in minutes and save rigged animated .X files.<br>-Import .x or .3ds meshes and weigh them on the included animated skeleton.<br>-Includes more than 80 professionally made animation sequences.<br>-Adjust vertex assignments and view animations in real time.<br>-Automatic vertex assignment weighs most of the vertices for you.<br>-Adjust your mesh in your own modeling program without losing vertex assignments.<br>-Capable of handling 3000+ poly meshes to support todays gaming standards.<br>-Extensive help files take you through the weighing process, step-by-step.<br>-Animated Models can be exported to .X and converted to .b3d with Ultimate Unwrap3D.<br><br><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b><br>Q. What does this program do?<br>Character Shop provides a simple and versatile pipeline to convert a simple mesh into a rigged, animated character model. The program loads a user's character mesh, weighs it onto an included skeleton with a set of pre-made animations, and outputs an animated, boned, .x model.<br><br>Q. Can I edit animations with Character Shop?<br>This is not a tool for creating original animations. A wide range of animations of typical game character movement are included, and more may be added in the future. User-made animations are not officially supported, since the process of producing these is very complicated.<br><br>Q. Can I import BVH or MOCAP motion capture files?<br>Motion capture is a poor choice for animations, unless you have a complete set that uses the same skeleton. It is unlikely that any of the "free" samples files you find on the internet will meet this requirement. They use different sized skeletons, with different numbers of bones and naming conventions. Rotational offset are unlikely to match, making the files completely incompatible.<br><br>Q. Are there any licensing restrictions for the models I make with Character Shop?<br>End users are allowed to use animated models created with Character Shop in any commercial or non-commercial projects. However, users may not sell the animated models they make with Character Shop, in any sort of product where the animated models are the product. This would basically amount to selling the animations we paid to have made. The animations included in this file are the property of Josh Klint / Leadwerks, and may not be used by anyone who does not own a license for the program, i.e. they may not be 'ripped' from a game a legitimate user releases.<br><br><img src="http://charactershop.thegamecreators.com/data/showcase/40ffcbe0ca6662.29831627_f.jpg"> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Maybe in an update but not likely imo. And anyway you dont need to change the bone sizes if your just looking to animate a human character. You import your model, you have to make sure you've modelled it correctly otherwise some editing of the model will be needed in order for it to fit the skeleton, then its simple to asign verts to each bone and all is colourcoded so you know what vert is attached to what bone.<br>One thing I have noticed is that you have to go back and forth from your modeling tool to Charactershop to change the scale of the model as they import either too small or way to big but thats no biggy. Once you learn what scale charactershop uses its simpler the next time.<br><br>It basically takes minutes to bone and animate a lowpoly character. <br><br>I have noticed that when I export it exports all animation sequences and you may not want all of them. There is no option to choose what anim is exported but one way around it is to remove the anims you dont want exported by taking them out of the directory they are in.<br><br>IMO CharacterSHop is a godsend for me as it removes alot of hassle with regards to animating a human character. I hope that there will be more anims and more options to control the mesh you import sp that it truly becomes effortless to animate a character.<br><br>I'm not good at writing reviews so what I have said above is basically my experiance with the software.<br><br>Keep up the good work Halo. :)<br><br>[edit] I think halo should make an animation editor or plugin for character shop allowing people to make there own anims.

The only way for blitz to do vertex animation is with bones, so to do per vert animation you would  need one bone per vert which would be very - very slow. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

At the moment, you aren't fitting any market.<br><br>Price-wise, I think the animation content probably justifies the price (edit: actually, on reflection, I don't -- see addendum), to the right customer. But who is that customer?<br><br>As it is, it's probably perfect for YOU personally (since I suspect you're working on a modern wargame / FPS). Someone uncharitably suggested it neatly allows all of us to make the same identical game. This is a tad harsh. You can make a modern wargame in which all the soldiers use pistols and traditional rifles OR a modern FPS in which all the soldiers use pistols or traditional rifles OR any other type of game in which the only figures are soldiers using pistols or traditional rifles.<br><br>These guys can't (a) talk on a radio (or stand around looking like they're using a piece of equipment), (b) throw a grenade, (c) defuse a mine (or crouch down while looking like they're busy), (d) crawl (edit), or (e) run and jump.<br><br>Before launching it, I thought it might make it easy to make either (a) a fantasy game, or (b) a sims style game. But it's missing fantasy combat moves and basic actions (e.g. pick up object), so that's no good. Then I tried to think of what I might use it for other than a contemporary FPS or wargame. It occurred to me I could do a Stargate SG-1 inspired tactical shooter -- but SG-1 uses bullpup configured rifles (and staff weapons) configurations which won't fit into the "rifle" pose character's hands. OK, there's no reason why my game's characters couldn't use M-4 carbines, but it's just the start of the problems I'd encounter, since the figure proportions are fixed and the poses are very singular.<br><br>Assuming you don't care about these issues, Charshop has a lot of promise, but it could certainly use more animations (or the ability to add your own), e.g. it could use ancient combat moves (attack with a one-hand weapon, attack with two hand weapon, dodge, block, duck, nock arrow, fire bow); magic moves (prepare spell, cast spell, maintain spell); more movement options (e.g. climbing, crawling, rolling); utility motions (use object, throw object, pick up object, put away object, push, pull, drag, reach for backpack); and some back and fill motions (e.g. changing from standing to crouching, pulling out and putting away a pistol).<br><br>That said, it either needs to become a more versatile animation tool (e.g. allow you to animate differently proportioned characters, allow you to tweak animations, and add your own) OR a more idiot-proof tool (e.g. provide a library of textured standard figures all of which "just work" -- civilian guy, civilian girl, soldier guy, soldier girl, etc.)<br><br>Addendum:<br><br>It seems to me that animations such as "run left" are semi-redundant (you can achieve much the same thing by simply rotating a couple of bones in code on the run animation, and doing this would allow you to have characters that organically twist their bodies to aim, etc.). I'd go for fewer animation variants of this kind and have more core animations.<br><br>On closer examination it in fact appears that many animations are simply trivial variants of each other created by either twisting a bone or two (e.g. "run left") or by copying and pasting animation tracks from one part of the hierarchy onto another movement (e.g. if you compare the different rifle animations you'll see that the character holds his upper body in exactly the same pose when crouching, standing, and ... amazingly ... jumping. Human beings do not do that). Some animations (e.g. walk left) have been tweaked a little to look better, but not cleaned up so you have legs intersecting mid-animation.<br><br>The core animations are really great, but many of the specific animations are hack jobs. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
