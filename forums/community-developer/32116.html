But I don't see anything in the<br>demo relating to that of CSG Geometry as far as carving or<br>hollowing objects in the demo version! I kinda' wanted to<br>be able to try these features out first before I made the<br>purchase to determine if it will work for me! So far...<br>I like everything else in CS4.1 except I dont see the above<br>mentioned features as the website so claims of it! Does anybody know if Josh has updated the demo on that site to include the carve &amp; hollow features in the demo on that site?!? Secondly here... I've been reading on these forums<br>from some of the users on here about issues with CS4.1<br>From what I've tried, I havn't had any problems with it so<br>far!! Besides the screenshots on the GameCreators website of what CS4.1 can do... Can anybody point me in a direction<br>to other peoples websites where they used CS4 to make a game or games with it!! I would like to view other peoples work and maybe play some demos of their work that they have done with CS4. And thirdly here...<br><br>Would any of you recommend CS4.1 or would you recommend another for purchase?!<br><br>I have another project I must do, and I need a map editor<br>that is already ready to go! Im' still working on the QoolEdit world builder at the moment... But it's not far enough along to be able to use as of yet! So I really do need a fairly decent map maker for this current project!<br><br>Many thanks in advance to all who reply! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I used to chat with you awhile back which you may not remember?!? But anyways though.. I was talking to<br>you awhile back when you was developing the Singularity Engine and you was at that time going to sell me a lisence<br>of the engine for around $500.00 I thought even then that your engine was worth it, But I was a little bit broke at<br>the time and I never got the funds though! But Im' glad to see you released the engine for free, But I still think you should of gotten something out of it for all the hard work you've done in making it!<br><br>And if you ever get a chance... I dont know if you happen to<br>have yahoo messenger or not... But look me up on messenger under the screen name of: doctorwho_3dgx<br><br>I would like to chat with you again sometime when you have time to do so...<br><br>Im' also developing the QoolEdit World Building System at the moment and your experience would be very much appreciatd<br>if I might be able to get some helpful suggestion on it<br>if that's ok with you?!<br><br>Here's a ScreenShots of my current Editor in development:<br><br><img src="http://www.3dgx.com/QoolEdit_Shot001.jpg"><br><br><br><br><img src="http://www.3dgx.com/QoolEdit_Shot002.jpg"><br><br><br><br><img src="http://www.3dgx.com/QoolEdit_Shot003.jpg"><br><br><br>I've still got a long ways to go before it will even be near close to what you currently have halo...<br>But Im' working on it and I have alot of plans for this project! </td></tr></table><br>

The Qoole editor<br>became open-source to anybody that wanted to expand upon<br>the source and make other things from it! All I took from<br>it was just the icons and used them for my project. I am<br>patterning my editor a little bit towards the Qoole editor<br>due to it's popularity and ease of use in the realm of making level maps for games! My editor has already got enough changes in it to make it a original editor and therefore different than the original Qoole editor. I choose<br>the icons because they are real easy to understand and they<br>are very clear to see. If this might be a problem... I'll create a topic about the icon usage in my editor and ask<br>some other people on this forum what they think about them.<br>If I get enough people saying stuff about the icons in my editor... I'll certainly change them. However though at the<br>moment, They are staying for now! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
