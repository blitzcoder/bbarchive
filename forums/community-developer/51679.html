So far I've made some interesting meshes, like a space fighter, that look better than I would have been able to do in Wings3D. They're low poly, too. I like the way you can extrude edges and connect your own polygons from vertices from there. Also, all Blender's features are nice, like being able to "smooth" vertices without increasing poly-count, automatic "weighted" vertices (moving a vertex or edge effects other vertexes also), etc., etc. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I have been using it and have recommended it to everyone for years. I knew about Blender3D for some time, too, but I stupidly confused it with Maya, thinking I would have to pay a lot to register or something, and therefore avoided getting attached to a modeler which was far out of my budget. Wings3D was nice, and I've produced some (poor quality) models for my games with it.<br><br>But now that I've found that Blender is in fact free, I'm really beginning to like it (not that I wouldn't have liked it if it cost). With Blender, everything seems so easy and intuitive (to me). In just two (or is it three) days, I've now created a realistic <i>F-86 Fighter Jet</i> model, a nice spaceship, and a fictional <i>Gatling Pistol</i>, all which look very nice IMHO. The thing that amazes me is that I've never been able to do artwork this good in Wings3D, Milkshape, or anything else ever before.<br><br>The spaceship model you posted looks nice, very well done, although it looks kinda mangled, cartooney, and uneven (comparing right side to left). The texturing is very good, though. But I guess I'm biased towards aerodynamically-feasible craft.<br><br>I guess everyone has their own favorite modeler, and Blender just seems to fit me very well. Overall, I <b>strongly reccomend</b> everyone to at least <i>try</i> Blender for a few days, and see if they like it. Once you get over the interface's unconventional style, I'm sure many will find, like I have, Blender to be an extremely powerful modeling and animating solution. Again, every artist has their own preferences of the tools they use; if you don't feel comfortable with Blender, it's probably just not for you. In my case, it fits me perfectly. :)<br><br>Anyway, I'll probably try to get some screenshots of my models up, in case you're interested.<br><br>P.S. - I've found that the Blender3D's built-in DirectX exporter's files don't load in Blitz3D if you have <i>any</i> whitespaces in your mesh names. Avoid spaces to avoid the hassel this initially caused me! Fortunately, this was the only inconsistancy I've found in Blender so far (although in fact it may be an inconsistancy in Blitz3D that causes this). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

And seems I have spent m uch more hours with it than you do ;) My case is not "I cant do a thing with it", I can do with it and with any ui for 3d , but I simply prefer others.<br><br>Yet though let's see after this great 2.40 upgrade of character animation tools. I 'd like em to keep improving character anim, as is my only interest in Blender (though I prefer XSI for that , lol)   , so...but for the modeling or level editing work with it (other than importing OBJs modeled somewhere else) I'll wait till these features are fully and properly added :<br><br>- A true turntable rotation (some of the older people told me the other day that turntable was like I say should behave in a very old version, but was wrecked at some point...) where z axis don't end rolling badly (I know ALL the workarounds, don't even mention them , as I use them :) (plus the numeric pad, etc, of course.But trust me, that's worse and could be better. ))<br><br>- Smooth groups at edit time.  Simple as the perfect way Wings have to set hard edges there where u want em and directly see the effect just hitting tab (in wings is not for edit the mesh, but to toggle smoothing) in case u're not working in smoothed mode. Or even a worse way to do it like Max smooth groups (not sure but I think wings was inspired in this for maya set hard edge in polygon tools, I think...I used that in Maya, too, but very little, as used Maya very little.)<br><br>- Multiple UVs , for lightmaps (yup, I know the manual uber slow and comple method with vertex colors, and the several scripts, the macouno works cool for baking to channel 1, the only one available in Blender. tested it the other day and worked, and no need even to read the Macouno's doc, as usual for me in Blender.(and most tools, heh ;)   ) ) <br><br>Once this is achieved, n-gons (HE mesh project, or whatever comes) would be cool. But what for. have this all since eons in Wings...<br><br>yet though I do also recommend Blender for most of the tasks it does, even modeling...If one can stand the turntable behaving, hehe. ;)<br><br>For animation, well, 2.40 is really sweet thing. yet quite several points to reach basic XSI animation(for the non basic it yet needs..ehm...no,. sorry, better not to mention), but above several other comercial tools. (not above the main expensive ones, imho.  )<br><br><br>Blender is not what some people remember it was. It's extremely better than that, and has no rival in free AND cheap world, but as a complete solution. I think it cannot rival yet with specialized tools in specialized areas : Sorry but Silo (and imho, Wings ;) , surely Modo, havent tested  ) are better modelers, messiah is better animator, Zrbush is better than the very good efforts of displacement painting(even in basic thing: speed), Gile[s] simply can do the lightmaps and 2 uv channeled exports, leave alone it's great quality,  Brazil and Final Render of Max, or Mental ray, are much better for rendering, deep paint 3d is really superior to the few features of it that Blender has...etc, etc. Is this saying Blender is bad? no! As any complete package suffer from this. Perhaps tools like Mirai , XSI or Maya do a really great job in many of those areas, but I know too many pros with maya that prefer Wings , Silo and Zbrush for many tasks (while all main work is done in their beast)  Is difficult to make a package that excell in all production. Is not so in a film production company(though Maya and XSI for example do a lot) either, so...<br><br>I am against using single package. Almost an activist of it. As I think results and power is smaller.For starting people, maybe conversions, exports, etc, can be an issue, but...<br><br>But this is an opinion. As...all here . ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Because after I set blender to the turntable mode, the view controls feels just like Wings3D now. Sometimes the view gets off-centered, but all you need to do is press Shift+C then C to center the cursor and set the camera to revolve around the cursor's current position (after you move the cursor the view keeps revolving around that point. But maybe I'm familiar with blender's views because I happened to favor Wings3D's "blender" style rotation the best, although I didn't know what blender was at the time. <br></div><br><br>It's slower. I also use wings blender camera. You don't need that distracting trickin Wings or Max.The turntable mode at the end is so different that I prefer keep in trackball.<br><br><br><div class="quote"> In my opinion, Blender is much more powerful than Wings3D, as far as modeling is concerned. In Wings3D, I have to right click, click move, click x, then move the mouse to move an item along the X axis. <br></div><br><br><br>I don't, I have all my most comon operations with hotkeys. I can customize then, change em , and have several config files of em even. Just ins key in the comand, press the key and that'd be your key till u change it, for that menu thing.<br><br><div class="quote"> The same thing has to be repeated if I want to "tweak" the verts, which makes this a slow and difficult process. <br></div><br><br><br>Nope, either. Since quite some versions you can use smarthighlighting so u mdoel similar to Mirai's way..you mouse over the vert, and hit the key for the operation (ie , the key u asigned for move free...or rotate, bridge, or whatever, you can do operations even while u track, thumb, pan...back and force, even)<br><br>&gt;3 years? :o  And u didn't know this?<br><br><div class="quote"> in the &gt;3 years I have been using Wings3D, I have never found any "magnet"  <br></div><br><br><br>do u update the tool?<br><br>lol, been there since eons...<br>hotkey or go to the menu, tweak mode...and key 1 will toggle that falloff...+ and - key to increase or decrease falloff if needed...<br><br>It's clear. It depend on how you use it thos years. Has brought the plate of food in companies fo rme during these years, in a very competitive environment, with hostility of Maxers and bosses...<br><br><div class="quote"> That's why everyone should not just try a few modelers when beginning 3D modeling <br></div><br><br>I began modeling back in ...'93, I think...3ds when was at msdos, only...since then have used in real depth like...dunno, dozens and dozens of 3d modeler, of any type out there... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Your models are <b>very</b> good IMO, definitely 1000 times better than I could possibly do at the moment.
