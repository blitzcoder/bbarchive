I love B3D pipeline and know that pudding is working on V2. Or at least last time we talked he was and it sounded very promising. Just need a 3D file format for Blitzmax really. <br><br>Pipeline is just about the best exporter I have ever used as far as features though, really lets you use 3dsmax as your level editor. Most of the commercial engines I've used werent as good and its free too.<br><br>But this mght be handy for trinity since the old B3D format is a little limited as far as UV channels and newer GL features.<br><br>3dsmax has something called Igame thats avaliable from discreet sparks forums, but it a high level SDK to help you create your own exporter, not something allready done for you. Probably the best solution for a custom engine, but you need a lot of expensive stuff and programming knowledge. Visual Studio 7/net ot whatever, 3dsmax and the 3dsmax SDK to start with, which gets pretty pricey :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So despite the extra UV channels slowing things down and using up extra vram, you will most likely save a lot by cutting back on surfaces, and get cleaner transitions between textures. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Note that I asked for reasons OTHER than more than 2 sets of UVs.  Since .b3d does in fact support that, even though Blitz3D does not, that's not a consideration.  Was that the only reason you had for wanting a new file format, or are there other considerations too?

Actually I prefer B3d over almost any other format out there, since it does a lot more out the box than almost any other, and having direct access to brush and texture flags gives you a lot of power.<br><br>Without the extra features, your kind of forced to use something like pipeline to hack the extra fubctionality, and allthough it works well, it's far better to have everyone using a common set of features and having equal opportunities. Perhaps I shoudl have said extend the .B3D format rather than replace it :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
