It works in a 'special super no.1 top secret' way that took me ages to figure out. I don't really want to give away too much ATM (that would just be silly), but the bit I'm especially proud of is the optimisation routines that take place before export / preview. :)<br><br>@wmaass - the mesh detail is fixed, but you can 'paint in' fine detail very easily. Just set the "Brush Size" slider to the lowest setting. That will give you control over individual verts for painting and terraforming. Also, use a low "Spray Rate" setting to slowly 'grow' the grass into the scene (hold down the left mouse button over the area you want to paint and you'll see what I mean). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Also, how the textures are applied and modified, if you can explain this would also be nice<br><br>4) instead of clicking on two buttons to have hills or crates, which requires the mouse to be then repositioned, would be better a key toggle - for example left shift key, if you press once you have hills, press it again and you have crates, and so on. You can give also a visual status of this by enlighting the relevant led, label or whatever.<br><br>5) All the keys should be redefinable, and the association between key and function, should be saved in a plain text config file<br><br>6) F1 to toggle help<br><br>7) Window mode<br><br>8) Option to abort long calculations<br><br>9) ESC should also be used to quit a submenu, and if it is pressed from the main, then should quit the entire application - if you get my drift. Perhaps you can't know the active menu window, but you can know the order in which the windows are opened, and close the latest at each ESC pressure, and so on.. Example:<br><pre class=code>
the user opens the Sun Position menu
then the user opens the Options menu
esc is pressed: the Options menu should disappear
esc is pressed: the Sun Position menu should disappear
esc is pressed: the Application quits.
</pre>Eventually, you can add a Shift+ESC which will quit the application at any time.<br><br>10) At the moment is not possible to create a map from scratch -  am I missing something from the menu ?<br><br>11) The red frame which surrounds the buttons for hills and crates, overlaps the drop down file menu, same for the next menu.<br><br>12) The arrow buttons located in the scrollbar under each texture bitmap, do not increase/decrease any value - the texture scaling can be changed only by dragging the cursor with the mouse.<br><br>13) UNDO - Please !<br><br>14) Different pre-set views of the entire map would be nice, it should be callable by 4 function keys. Alternatively, you can give the ability to set some '3D bookmark' where to put the camera once the related key is pressed, as well as a 'reset camera' key.<br><br>:)<br><br>Sergio. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
