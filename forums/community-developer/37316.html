For many years though I've been played around with the various demos but have always been totally lost because trueSpace is an icon driven environment and yet the help file that comes with the demo has no pictures! I was always without a clue, but kept coming back to try because I loved the results.<br><br>So what finally sold it for me? Well I had been using a free version of Cinema, but couldn't export animations for games so I bought 3D Canvas Pro, which turned out to be a waste of money due to bugs and other problems. Left without a modeller and thinking the only things left were in the several thousand pounds bracket I decided to give trueSpace one more go and was able to get around it a bit easier than before (I also had some tutorials in a copy of 3D World), I was also eligable for a special offer which included some tutorial videos - so I bought it.<br><br>All I can say is that after watching the 'Spirit of the Interface' videos is "Why the hell doesn't Caligari give this video away for free?" It opened my eyes to how easy and uncluttered the whole interface is, had I seen this video I would have bought trueSpace ages ago. The demo, as far as I was concerned, did more harm than good as the help simply wasn't good enough on it's own.<br><br>So basically, give it a chance. The interface is different and I can understand some people do hate it (I was one once), but it can be customised and it is actually pretty powerful once you know your way around it. And if any one from Caligari is reading this, please take note. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
