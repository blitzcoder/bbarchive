Singularity is an engine developed by Halo about three years ago.  It runs strictly in the Blitz 3D domain.  It was used to create a few very neat very impressive demos (not sure if a full game was done using it).<br><br>Check out the www.leadwerks.com website videos for some examples.<br><br>Halo released the complete source code to Singularity a long while back.

By using CShop and Singularity you can very quickly develop game levels.  You build in CShop and add entities such as doors, flare, flaming and smoking torches, water fountains etc. load it into Singularity and voila an already working level for you game with collision, lighting also built in.<br><br>If you haven't seen it - you should check it out, we can all learn quite a bit from it.<br><br>Josh has moved on now to 3DWS a completely new format (although it looks similar to CShop - what works works I guess) - what the future holds for this format is anyones guess.  <br><br>IPete2. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I could set something up in CShop then save it and watch it happen in realtime inside Singularity.  <br><br>My point was Josh was creating a commercial level editor which generated exciting in built feature set levels for a public domain game engine (both of which he developed) as well as having the ability to add your own (whatever you could dream of) into both - yourself.<br><br>As it stood at version 4.x Singularity was pretty powerful as a game development engine, and I believe it could certainly be used as part of something bigger.  For my part I added doors/lifts/moving platforms to the main Singularity engine, others must have added their own stuff no doubt.  <br><br>By the time Josh was done he had physics,  portals, moving/animated objects/ shadow objects, realtime lighting effects (such as gun flares firing down all the walls on a prelit corridor), particles,  you name it...  It was quite unlike anything else I have ever seen created in Blitz, certainly better than anything I have seen (on any Blitz forum).<br><br>Singularity was quite far developed, but I know Josh wanted more - and believed that B3d could not deliver what his ambition required. So B3d was only another stepping stone to something bigger.  What that is is for Josh to know and us to guess.<br><br>As for anything Josh is currently thinking about or working  on... Singularity will no doubt play a role in as much that what he learned there will help him do even better next time - I will be watching closely - I am pretty sure it won't be in BlitzMax or Blitz3D - but a BlitzPlus/Open GL hybrid...hmm...<br><br>IPete2. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
