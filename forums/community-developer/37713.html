He is saying to animate your scene in 3D Studio Max and export it to b3d using B3D Pipeline (look in Specs and Utils.)  But then you have to write quite a bit of code for all the other stuff (camera control, lighting, sounds, any particle effects, etc.) plus you probably want to write an editor to tie all the content together.  I assume he suggested gile[s] as an editor for adding that other stuff, but it is at most a dropper for placing entities; at that you might as well suggest Droplet since that is free.  You would need something with a timeline to trigger effects and camera moves at specific times in the movie.  Depending on what you are doing you might even want a way to write text to display, and then set triggers on the timeline to popup the text boxes.<br><br>I had been thinking of writing tools to do this stuff.  That is, an editor for composing a scene, and then playback code that parses the scene file exported from the editor.  I had been thinking only of cutscenes for use in games, but you definitely have a point that this would be an interesting tool for doing machinima.<br><br>I eventually decided not to undertake this project however.  It would be an enormous amount of work for a tool I do not currently need, nor is there much demand from others for a tool like this.<br><br>But, now that you've gotten me thinking about it, I think a simple cartoon/movie creator app could be really popular shareware.  Probably with lots of provided animated characters for hobbiests to drop into their movies.  In fact, I vaguely recall someone I know once worked on an app along these lines for kids to use. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I think Machinima can become pretty big time if you create something with a lot of character that's really super who knows ... you might get it on a movie screen or something and with a good setup you could do scenes easily without having to pre - render it all.  Now with realtime graphics on Doom 3's level you might actually have a shot to make something almost like a Pixar movie and it would take less time possibly once you had the tool set up and running. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Who said that previously?  And you're wrong, animation is not the main issue to address.  There are already tons of existing animation tools you can use to generate that data.  I suppose camera control can to a large degree be taken care of via existing animation tools too (by exporting the camera movement with the b3d file as a pivot, and then in code parenting the camera to that pivot,) but that still doesn't help you for triggering effects on a timeline, stuff like sounds and particles. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you create something like 3D Movie Maker, it will be fun for kids to play around with, but will generally be too limited. Most 3D apps have a hardware renderer, and if you use light game style geometry, you should be able to render it more or less in real time straight to an .avi. Some of them even supports advanced shaders, shadows, multi-pass (for anti-alias, motion blur and dof) and so on.<br><br>I think the Machinima folks are interested in making movies quickly and easily, e.g. tell the character to walk there, bend down and pick up that thing and hit that other character with it etc...without going in and adding lots and lots of keyframes, moving polys and so on. The tool I would use for creating Machinima movies would be Second Life ( www.secondlife.com ), it has everything you need...including people who would be willing to star in your movies. I've also heard some rumors that Sims 2 will contain good tools for creating movies with your sims, so that might be an option.<br><br> Ragnar <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
