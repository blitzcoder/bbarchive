I am currently in the very early stages of making an old school isometric tactical RPG, think Fallout 1 and 2. <br><br>Now that's established, I don't have much experience or talent in the way of creating isometric art. I'm not interested in hand painting tiles which will be too costly in terms of time. I also don't have high expectations on art quality... *Read* It's ok if it's a little cheap looking, after all, this is an old school RPG. <br><br>What I'm looking for is a somewhat easy solution to "mass produce" isometric art, eg get together a bunch of textures and paint them on walls and floors. Also, something that isn't going to require me to spend 5 hours to make a single isometric character or fixture.<br><br>I've looked at World Creator 2.5, which seems to be pretty decent software for creating isometric walls, doors, objects, etc. It's not really meant for creating characters. I think it has a lot of potential, if used correctly, you can make an old school looking game without a huge time investment. Does anyone know of a better solution out there, to make 2d walls, floors, fixtures, etc without a huge learning curve and detailed hands on approach?<br><br>For creating terrain, I heard Bryce mentioned a few times, is this true? Once again, my requirements wouldn't be a super detailed tile and 100 ground textures for variety, just something that looks decent that wouldn't require tedious, hand touched work for each step.<br><br>For character creation, I hear that Daz 3D and Poser can be used for this purpose, anyone have any thoughts? I have used Daz 3D in the past, to export a character into tile sheets for 2D animation. I haven't used Poser yet. The characters wouldn't need to be detailed at all, especially facial expressions, etc.  <br><br>I think that sums it up, thanks for reading this far. Can anyone share what they think might be considered the tools of choice of creating isometric art in those 3 areas without committing a huge amount of time and resources to create it? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Since you don't have artistical experience, you have two tasks here: <br><b>1)</b> Find 3D and 2D tools you are comfortable with.<br><b>2)</b> Create your game's content and solve any artistic\technical requirements <i>using</i> those tools.<br><br>You're somewhat behind right now, because you don't have enough experience to have gone through task #1 already, and you can't proceed to #2 without it.<br><br>Notice I'm talking not only of 2D tools, but 3D as well, which is the direction I think you should go. 3D can be cheap and fast while still looking moderately good, because a big part of the work is done by the machine. <br><br>Regardless of 2D or 3D: you still need talent to create something convincing and aesthetic.<br><br>With 3D you can go two ways: real-time or pre-rendered graphics. Which one to choose? <i>the one that looks best for your game</i>.<br>If you don't know what these terms mean, please research on them. GameDev.Net is a great resource for isometric game making, having articles, an exclusive subforum for this genre and art sections where this subject frequently comes up.<br><br>How to create isometric content in 3D: model your environments and characters in any modelling package you have (3DS Max recommended, but use your favorite). Make sure everything is scaled and fits together.<br>Texture and optionally animate the subject (texturing comes before animating). <br>When you're ready to shoot the subject (be it a tile, a character, prop etc.), create an <i>orthographic</i> camera at a 45º angle, center the view-target to the subject and render the scene. <br>This is one isometric frame that you should save with whatever organized file naming convention you can come up with - I can't tell you what to use, just make sure it's something that makes sense to you.<br><br>Then open this frame in Photoshop (or other) and make any touch-ups you want. Most of the time a simple "Contrast" filter can really shine some light to boring texture work.<br><br><b>Twinsen's Odyssey</b> <br>A game to use as reference.

Or if you don't want to use pre-rendered, do the exact same thing and make a 3d game with the tiles your created that renders with an isometric projection. Not sure if that made sense... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
