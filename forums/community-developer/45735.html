Then there are also some motion capture samples in the net view (which also holds some textures). <br><br>As for geometry, there's the character desinger and you can get some ugly "man and woman" models (which with some tweaking are a great start for your custom model).<br><br>For file input and output, Xsi can export to .X format (via the plugin found in the web) which i've found works nicely with ultimate unwrap to get content in .b3d format quite fast wo. so much work.<br><br>About those extra functions in your first topic, from an animator viewpoint (specially the fcurve editor), i wouldn't like to have to animate without them, because it is with their aid that you can really put some juice in the movement (does ease-in, ease-out sounds familiar?), the way stuff moves in space. Then there's also the dope sheet (great for basic timing and some pose stuff). <br><br>Maybe the animation mixer seems nonsense to you for games, but in reality, it lets create different motions for different characters in a snap.. sharing and blending.. you know, it is "character" animation, not moving an array of robots which have the exactly same motion (boring).<br><br>There's a .bvh import function in xsi, it's just that you've to play with it before getting it to work correctly and then you'll have lots of "prefabs" motion clips floating in the net (which btw, are way easy to edit, again with the fcurves editor).<br><br>If you wanna develop for consoles, I know that some game content has been developed with Softimage (the father of Xsi) and that there are several plugs for consoles (if you are a licensed developer, nintendo for Softimage, psx for softimage and Xbox for xsi).<br><br>As you state you are just interested in animation, i will just mention  rendermaps, normal map generators, and scripting. So even for games, these tool indeed fits quite nice, at least for me. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Fcurves allow you to edit timing with a nice amount of control, you control your inbetweens with them. Even if you are walking your character only on spot, fcurves do help. For the juice, I meant the juice for animation, character animation (with good timing you can give a whole sense of personality). <br><br>What i have noticed in "low end" systems is that you have just a little bit of control on how those bones move in space and time, so you are somewhat limited. The last time i checked, I was able to move the frame in which action occurs, but just for the whole pose, not for single elements (which was a painful process for me)<br><br>For the animation mixer, i wasn't thinking as much as exporting individual actions, but exporting blended actions to have different cycles for every character. But then again i might not be up to programming skills, so this might be a "bad thing" programming-wise.<br><br>About the price, you're right, xsi is still somewhat expensive for the casual hobbyst (sp?), just a far cry from what it used to cost. Still i find that i wouldn't like to animate wo. those tools.<br><br>Gord: you are right, xsi needs at least 1280x1024 to work comfortably, the bigger your monitor, the better. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But in my case, I only animated before at work with Max and character Studio.

It has no real IK. Is all fk. It has no way to make joint pinning or the like (Blender has)<br>But it has a big market being simple to learn, and loaded of game exporters integrated in it.(md2, x, b3d...all work well)<br><br>In Blender you can do most of the advanced stuff, but allways in a way mroe long a complex, less accurate and less perfect way than animating with xsi, less powerfully, and less also than doing in Max or Gmax, even.<br><br>I'd like to have time to work on learning well this tool, but seems I continue with projects and life stuff, and have my documentation and videos almost intact...bad thing is as I learnt what I need to bang animations, seems lost interest for the moment to go deeper, hehe. I'll do at some point.<br><br>Yup, better have a monitor reaching 1280...most TFT 17" reach that very well, if of some quality...<br><br>I use it with 800x600, but due to the use of certain layout, and as I only use th very raw character animation core stuff, and as I use to with any tool, I did set up my key bindings for the tools I'd use...<br><br>In max, Character STudio curves are *a pain* to handle, while standard max bezier handles for that and other tools,make much more sense... Yup, the ease in , and out, and the huge world of control you have just handling properly the curve is important, but b3d engine is not the only (i said wrong, probably the format carry it, indeed, I'm sure of that: is the b3d engine what can't play it) engine with only option of doing just linear interpolation. <br><br>Quake3 used to make some kind of smooth non linear interpolation (quake 2 was linear, so, md2 too) for md3...<br><br>Sorry if I don't reply...I hope to remember to check it back, but lately I'm not much into Blitz worlds... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You can also save out the material as a .FX of HLSL file. on top of that you can load in these files and apply them to your models in max, giving you a WYSIWYG environment to work in.<br><br>I usualy end up doing environments and level building more than I do charcter stuff, more and more games are using regular 3D meshes instead of Legacy BSP stuff in modern engines since GPU's have come a long way and can throw pretty complex geometry around. <br><br>This isn't quite the case with blitz which uses a 5 year old API to render graphics with, but it still allows for a lot of flexibility, particularly if you have something like the excellent B3D pipeline exporter that Pudding created for 3dsmax-Blitz.<br><br>It's actually better than a lot of commercial engine pipelines, allowing you to create in game cut scenes and only requiring about 10 lined of code in blitz3D in order to play it back in its entirety with fully animated lights, cameras, fog, brushFX, UV's (you name it)<br><br>In this case you can use max to its full advantage, and set up or play back pretty sophisticated scenes and environments.<br><br>You can't expect the cheaper shareware tools to compete directly with the high end apps in all fronts, but some do prove to be exceptionaly good at key areas that they target specificly. like Wings for organic modeling, unwrap3d for UV mapping and translation between formats.<br><br>And then you have tools like sswifts new seamless texture tool which does an amazing job of preparing your digital images for working within realtime environments. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
