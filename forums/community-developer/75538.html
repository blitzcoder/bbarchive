It's missing quite a few funamental modelling functions (even with plugins) which you'll find in almost every other modeller.  Also, Blender's controls and interface change from version to version, and the docs (besides being a giant, unfinished mess) are quickly made redundant.  This also goes for video tutorials, which often reference inactive shortcuts keys, and interface elements that have been moved.  Beginners can be quickly frustrated.<br><br>Another thing is people are talking here about which modeller they think is best, but they're forgetting to mention whether it's an open or closed one.  For example, Wings3D is a closed geometry modeller, while something like Blender is able to create open geometry models.<br><br>The point is- while something like Wings3D is a brilliant tool, sometimes being limited to closed geometry can be confusing to beginners, especially when things go wrong. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

How do you teach a complete beginner to do something when there's no complete manual?  Sure, they can go and ask someone, but that's not an ideal situation.

There is a plugin to do it, but it's really good at causing problems in a mesh, and is slow as anything to use.  Another example is- create a cube and create an edge loop around the middle, vertically.  Then, select and extrude the two bottom faces down, as if you were creating legs.  With those two faces still selected, try and shift them both apart along x away from each other, as if the legs were doing the splits.  The two faces must not scale.  Can you do it, and if so, how long did it take you to work it out?  This is a two second thing in almost any other modeller.<br><br>Blender's certainly capable, but it is lacking a few things right now. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you can get past windows standardism then you will be surprised how easy it actually is.<br><br>Put it this way, you can use any app with some guidance (like a training video) within a day. I did my first blender model (a snowmobile), fully textured within 3 hours. What I meant was you need a few weeks to get "into" any program and deeply explore what it is capable of, this applies to all the 3d apps no matter what it is. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

What's a beginner going to do when they move from Blender to a tool with bevel?  Nothing, because they've learnt bevel in Blender means 'screw up mesh' or 'bevel every edge'.  Being able to bevel something is part of modelling 101.<br><br>"Its certainly worth a few weeks of trial before buying an expensive modeller and use only a fraction of the tools."<br><br>Sure, it's worth a look, but I'd prefer to see good foundations laid. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
