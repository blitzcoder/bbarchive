I've seen a couple of others too ( Art something was one of them ) and they were even worse than Dosch.<br><br>Of course you're going to find much better stuff at PolyCount and PlanetQuake.. a lot of those guys are professionals in the Games Industry, and many of the rest will be one day. You'd be very lucky to get them to work for you though, and you wouldn't get their textures at Marlin prices.<br><br>If a few of those guys were to get together and form a "coalition" and sell their cd's on a joint website, they could make them avaiable at favourable prices and could probably do very nicely out of it.

It's $99, and it's got over 1500 images on it, which is way more than Marlin Studios' CD's have on them.  About 560 megs of texture.  Most images are 1280x1024 in size, though a few are smaller.  Most images are NOT seamless.  This is because most professional artists can make textures seamless themselves and it's better to have the original image to go from if you want to get a certain effect than to be forced to use some bland generic version of the image I come up with.  The images are also for the most part not color adjusted or corrected.  Most look just fine, but some could use some touch up.<br><br>If what you want is premade textures you can just stick in your game, then this is not for you.  But if you want a huge collection of images which are very well suited to making game textures WITH, then this is probably just what you need.<br><br>As for what textures are contained in the CD...<br><br>Rocks<br>Dirt<br>Leaves<br>Grass<br>Moss<br>Shiny metal<br>Rusted metal<br>Oxidized metal<br>Bent metal<br>Painted metal<br>Electronics<br>Rock debris<br>Brick debirs<br>Brick walls<br>Tile<br>Brick walkways<br>Cobblestones<br>Tires<br>Snow<br>Beach<br>Signs<br>Brick buildings<br>Stone walls<br>Concrete<br>Concrete rubble<br>Metal scraps<br>Metal roofing<br>Metal siding<br>Shingles<br>Wood<br>Skies<br>Fire truck<br><br>And much more.  Tons of images in each of the above categories.  Images taken from around the ocean, around a junkyard, my house, in a city.<br><br>This collection represents 2-3 years of photographing textures, and there's a ton of stuff in here which isn't easy to come by if you just go out on a jaunt in the city with your camera for a few days.<br><br>Take note of my price compared to Marlin's stuff.  Forget the "bump maps" he promises you.  They're just greyscale versions of the images with the contrast turned down.  Pfft!  You'll get maybe 200 images on one of his CD's, half of which may be these supposed "bump maps" and even if they're seamless they may not even be SQUARE so you have to retouch them anyhow for use in games.  And you'll pay more.  So why not go for a huge collection of photos by a texture artist who knows what texture artists are looking for in textures?<br><br>But like I said, if all you want is generic sci-fi textures someone has made for you, this is not the collection for you.<br><br>I haven't got a website up with thumbnails yet, but I'm sure just about everyone will find a ton of images in here which are useful for their game. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I like to work from original shots, non-cropped, non-adjusted raw source. "True readymade textures" are probably better for the beginner but as they are "finalized" you can not alter them easily.
