Because it is alpha, i think some of the functionality is still to be added, <strike>but it is pretty damn stable for an alpha release so far :)</strike> Edit, scratch that last, it is definetly an alpha lol.<br><br>I think the majority of it is simply the layout (the old default layout was cack, i never used it i always made my own). and they have added search bars to everything too which is a nice touch. The other thing i like is the docked type in transform fields (rather than the old shift-n floating one) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I have also used for various jobs/lengths of time; Milkshape, Maya, lightwave, Fragmotion, AC3D, Hexagon, Wings, giles and a few others on a semi-pro/hobby basis. (I got started in imagine on the amiga and the old dos based 3ds on the PC, anyone remember those? waiting hours for a few shiny balls to render! :)<br><br>The biggest thing i never liked about blender is the rendering output. It is a bit scrappy compared to the industry standard modellers (but i dont use it as a production renderer, just a modeller and animator and for this i find it very useable). The old interface was good when you got used to it but it was a sharp learning curve and this put a lot of people off. <br>I think this new one will really help the kind of people that like to click endlessly before reading a tutorial (i'm a bit like that usually, but blender was so.. odd, i went for the tuts immediately :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

At the end of the day different 3D apps suit different Artists just like some artists like pencil, or paster and drawing whilst others prefer oils, acrylics or watercolour. Oil and acrylics can look the same but feel completely different.<br><br>It's that feel that ultimately leads to someone picking one app over another. <br>I recently looked at 3d modeling on the mac and tried a ton of apps. The only one that came close to being pleasant to work with was SILO. <br><br>In the end I decided that the mac wasn't for me simply because 3ds max is the killer app I can't do without. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Until then Blender 2.5 is currently in alpha with plans to go to beta shortly.<br><br>When the python api is settled someone will have to step up to the mark and either convert the existing .b3d exporter script to the latest python or develop a new one from scratch.
