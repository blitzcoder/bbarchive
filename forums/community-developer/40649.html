Being at game companies learnt the more tools, the safer...but yep, I am a person who uses to clutter is OS and hd, but also i know how to cleam my registry, and remove unused dlls safely ;) <br><br><div class="quote"> - i'm guessing 3D Explorer is actually 3D Exploration. took me a while on that page to figure that out. damn. no wonder i could never find it and could only find the paid version. thanks for that. at least i can get that Cornell Box .iv file to open cleanly. but still no .ply support. bummer. <br></div><br><br>Yep. Again, I omit info when I think the person reading will guess the stuff..seems you finally guessed it was there, as I said "dig" that page...because is 3d exploration 1.5 the thing to download in that page, not the today's deep Exploration. Sorry if I wasn't totally explicit, I was writting very quick and knowing the reader had a good brain ;)<br><br><div class="quote"> - "there are scans in dxf format , of course, non uv mapped. There are others in obj.U only gotta dig a bit". obj format opens fine. full body person was only about 250k  <br></div><br><br>Some reasons maybe for that.probably a ply file is cleverer designed for huge data. Or dxf, even.maybe as OBJ is ascii, the processing is slower for 3d tools. maybe there's a limit I don't know in OBJ, but I think I have seen exports of millions of tris, if I remember well, in obj.<br><br><div class="quote"> tri's tho. too low for good rez actually. issue is  <br></div><br><br>I know I shouldn't ask. But fills me of curiosity why a game programmer is so interested in such hi res stuff...<br>Displacement maps or normals maps would be my bet, but I suspect your interest is different...That unless your planning to use them in your games in some rendered form...<br>Or doing a ..medical app...<br><br><br><div class="quote"> .ply files. also, is subject 82, available in other formats? didn't dig that far. zip only has .ply format. <br></div><br><br>What I meant is in general, in internet, specially in college's ftps, but also other places, samples of many other 3d scanners, etc, there are also 3d scans repositories...I guess if I'd do one of my "loong searches"  I'd come up with a lot. But as usual in my game jobs experience or even just graphic design, I don't find exactly what I look for and gotta end up modelling my self...Not speaking of scan accuracy, heh. BTW, a scan needs a lot of retouch, unless ur use admits using it as raw as it comes.(with all the bumps and weirdy things, like thathead u put shows..Besides, u'll notices how it never gets well into sharp corners...Microscribe I say is my fav, you can do sharp stuff, with little points (it trnaslates to nurbs!via max/maya plugin..) and is also cheaper, and can scan huger models as is a machanical arm that serves u pointing in -painted if u prefer- virtual wires painted in the original model.(topology brush in real life ;) ))<br><br>I was near to buy one of those 3d scanners(not microscribe, cheap but not enough for my pocket)...Picza or something like that...where like 2k $...but only scanning little 3 or 4 inches models, and during long hours. And also, with lots of limits. Polhemus iso tracker based in a magnetic field, there was the more expensive laser gun scanners, the actual professional thing by them (really expensive) , the wonderful microscribe "cheap" thing (a bit more expensive than Max, I think, then) , and those based on photogrammetry, rotating cameras that build a model uv mapped and textured, already, hehe. Quite expensive.<br>I think best for most uses is Microscribe aproach.<br>But today surely there are new techniques, and new prices...<br><br><div class="quote"> - "convert an vrml or whatever the format to OBJ." again, it's the flavor of VRML. of course if there was no direct .ply convertor then the next step would be to find a VRML2 to VRML convertor. one thing at a time. <br></div><br><br>Ultimate unwrap, if you install a plugin -a link to the user that made it is in his site- can import vrml2 , and I think can export as vrml1. Also, Blender, with the plugin of the format wished (today it open almost every format out there, but u need to dig -again- as is usally about a python script of certain user interested in teh format.usually works perfect. ) also exports to vrml1. BTW, it natively imports stl. I know , u don't need it.<br><br><div class="quote"> i don't install stuff that doesn't look useful. too  <br></div><br><br>It totally is, is the solution if you're worring about ply files.. ;)<br><br><div class="quote"> much crap on the machine is bad. but glad you install stuff so easily! will take a look at those hidden  <br></div><br><br>As I said, I just clean my registry from time to time...worked also as a pc tech support. I'm no genius in that area, but I can keep my pc with good performance and zero problems even installing lots of stuff, did so allways ;) There are tools to help the cleaning, but I tend to do a lot of cleaning manually. Dunno, I don't notice a serious slow down, not even in my ut2k3 game, or editing huge mesh files, or doing huge 2d works...Not installing certain stuff would be having less functionality in my computer. Anyway, I don't install everything. Just stuff I think is useful.And use to kill most traces of it once not needed.<br><br><div class="quote"> nice hunting job. now if we can only get you to shorten/organize your posts. those are tough. :) <br></div><br><br>haha.Sorry. Just I can't avoid that.<br><br><div class="quote"> didn't use the one you uploaded tho. figured you found something somewhere (either on P2P or on their site). <br></div><br><br>No, not p2p.Neither illegal...all fine stuff, legal, found in public ftp of a college. Can't remember the url (and was one of those long urls) Simply, seems there are 3d scanner companies that try to make free tools like an addon in purchase, or just don't want everybody have access to that.If I found in public, non hidden folders of a college, it was WAY visble, and linked from several easy-to-find in google htms... So, I guess is free.<br><br><div class="quote">  for anyone interested there are links on the website to both login and no login versions. who knows why. but here are the two "no login" versions:<br><br>ftp.cyberware.com/dropbox/plyview <br></div><br><br>Another possibility is the non free one has a better viewer...go guess.<br><br><br><div class="quote"> here's a couple conversions i did with the "older" iplyview. big iges file. over 200mb. <br></div><br><br>I suppose you have a good computer, then ;)<br><br><div class="quote">  the obj file tri's are shown there too (375,282) much easier to handle.  <br></div><br><br>As you see, a 3d scan "as is" comes with lots of weird bumps, produced by the scanning process. I guess tools like the ones I mentioned in blender could come handy.<br><br>But probably Maya have very good relax, reduce and optimize tools. I gotta check in my XSI.<br><br>Once again, sorry my long posts.<br><br>But way many times, at Blitzcoder (and a hundred other older forums) ppl know after such a long random chat I give useful info, hehe. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
