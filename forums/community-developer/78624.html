I wanted to use the .b3d format, very nice format, but very resource intensive too. I ran tests on all my machines and they could only handle a handful of b3ds onscreen at once. With Md2's I could have 200 before my framerate dropped to an unacceptable level. I realize there are some other problems with Md2, nonpickable, no heirarchy for children, etc, but the resouce thing is my big issue right now. I was so upset about it, I went and bought torque, lol. But I have 2 years with Blitz3d and my program so I'll still be toying with it.<br><br>If Games like Counterstrike (Original one) can have so many models (mdl's?) on screen at once, why cant we?<br><br>Thanks. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Yes my models are single mesh, skinned models. Sooooo, .3ds models must be segmented seperate meshes for each limb, and you must use scale/rotate/move functions in the animation program while taking keyframe snapshots of the model. Once you have this you can export to .3ds? Ill will do some tests and see if I can get this working.<br><br>Any ideas on the Md2 flickering faces thing?<br><br><div class="quote"> They aren't using DirectX 7 that's barely supported by most graphics cards :) -Chwaga <br></div> <br>DirectX 7 was released in Feb of 2000<br>CounterStrike Version 1 was released in Dec of 2000<br>I'm not sure what version of DX the Original Counterstrike was released with, but either it was 7 or an earlier version of it. Even back then, you could have 16 players on a server without any problems.<br><br>My point is, even with boned models and half life physics engine running under DirectX 7 or a previous version they were able show a high number of models on screen at once.

I cant believe I didnt try that earlier. I understand the 3ds animation now. Build objects, rotate/scale/move them, set a keyframe, move animation slider, rotate/scale/move them, set a keyframe, etc..
