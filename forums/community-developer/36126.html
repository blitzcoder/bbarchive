Which is okay for models I was gonna UVmap anyway (in a completely DIFFERENT utility: LithUnwrap,) but very poor for structures like buildings.<br><br>Blender is free, but has an insane learning curve and no undo function.  (HOW does an open-source editor end up with NO UNDO FUNCTION!?  It's like the most important part of ANY editor!)  <br><br>Cartography Shop is beautiful, but it uses the Quake2 theory of mapping, (I.E. with the floors and walls and ceiling floating in a void... so how do I know those uneccessary external faces get cropped without giving it a good test-compile?)  I wish you could automatically resize a texture to fit the brush, but I can do without that.  I would probably get Cartography Shop right now, except that I read somewhere there's a version 5 coming out soon that owners of version 4 will still have to buy seperately anyway.<br><br>Gile[s] is an absolutely perfect lighting solution.  Now if only it could model, too...<br><br>B3DTweak was worth it.  It's too bad that I'll probably be getting gile[s] soon, thus rendering it obsolete.<br><br>I do so wish there was just one program that could do everything.  Flipping back and forth between all these different programs to create my 3D content just seems ridiculous to me.  Then again, I guess that's why they call it a pipeline, not a spigot.<br><br>Anybody got an app that I missed?  Especially one that is good for creating indoor levels?  I'm REALLY tempted to get CS, but not if the developer's going to pull the plug on upgrades in a month or two. :(<br><br>(edit) And another thing!

Yeah, it's free (with my version of Blitz, anyway,) and yeah, it automatically scales and tiles textures to an arbitrary value.  But there's no way to manually edit textures, so you're stuck with a value of 1.0 unless you also get Decorator, which means an entire secondary creation process in a different app.  And on top of everything else, Decorator makes you edit textures one by one.  Which takes me back to my Duke Nukem 3D days, but doesn't really facilitate the kind of multi-textured, next-gen antics I'd like to see in my games.<br><br>Ah, thanks.  I'd forgotten all about Quill3D.  Quill3D's official website (http://www.quill3d.tk/) seems to be down, though.  I managed to google some third-party links to the shareware app, so I'll give it a try.

Using separate tools forces you into a more restricted workflow than using well-integrated tools (with many steps being, in essence, one way). Even then, if you work out what the restrictions are and take them into account, you can minimise grief.<br><br>E.g. if you know that a few poorly placed vertices in a character's joints will cause problems in animation, and that having to redo the vertices will mess up texture mapping (which you normally do before rigging and animation), then maybe you need to do some test animation early on (on untextured models) to make sure your joints are OK to save going through the "final pass" workflow only to discover you have to start over.<br><br>Even with expensive tools, there's a lot of "basket weaving" involved (when you weave a basket, to correct prior mistakes you have to unravel everything you did since making that mistake first). E.g. if you discover that your model needs new vertices in a joint you may end up having to redo UVs, textures, and vertex weights. A lighting problem may force you to go back to your base model (d'oh I used the wrong NURBS system; d'oh I need to tweak my base curves; d'oh all the vertices have changed and now my textures are whacked). Tools such as 3D Studio Max and Maya, which allow you to retain in tact the actions taken to a base object (to an extent) still fail when changes to an earlier stage make subsequent actions ambiguous.<br><br>Of course, if Michelangelo accidentally knocked a piece off a block of marble, he had problems that make ours look pretty simple.<br><br>That said, you do pay for convenience, and if you value your time, pay for decent tools.
