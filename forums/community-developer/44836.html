It has a style of creating geometry pretty much identical to UnrealEd, changing "Add" and "Subtract" for "Fill" and "Carve" (or whatever Maplet's terms are). I should add the Unreal Editor is my favorite level design editor of all the engines/editors I've ever tried (practically all of them - no joke.. I'm a 3D engine/editor junkie :-).<br><br>The interface does have its bizarre quirks. Navigating the camera can become rather odd after a bit.. I find I have to reset it after a while or it starts spinning out of control if I try to rotate the view even a little, etc... But the editing part is very intuitive and the results are immediately apparent.<br><br>The one major downfall to it that I find is its limited texture editing capabilities. It's pretty much mandatory that you go in with another program after to re-texture certain surfaces that were inadverdently affected during creation, etc. So.. I looked into that and found "Decorator" here on the Blitz site.<br><br>This leads me to my questions, first about Decorator:<br><br>1. Does decorator allow you to rotate, scale or pan a texture on the surface, or are you only able to re-paint a different texture to it? To be truly useful, I think those functions are mandatory.. What if I want to decorate a surface with a certain texture but then need to scale it vertically to fit right, etc.. Does Decorator allow for this? I would try it myself but I'm on a PC right now that can't run Maplet... or probably Decorator for that matter.<br><br>Can Maplet be used to create any sort of exterior structures, *and* interior? Like, a buiding I could put on a landscape with an actual interior people can walk into.. or would they have to be separate models?<br><br>If Decorator isn't the program to do this.. are there any alternatives out there than can?<br><br>And as a final question, does anyone have any shots of work they've done using Maplet? I have no doubt of what *can* be done with it with enough time and creativity but aside from the demo map that ships with it, I haven't seen anything else. Does anyone even really use it?<br><br>Thanks! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Though I know it works off of CSG and not polygonal geometry in the "traditional" sense... it is still do-able. UEd has a vertex editing mode.. *extremely* handy.<br><br>Though I think I read somewhere that Maplet isn't being developed anymore.. I think it's even released for free now. 'least I'm about 90% sure that's the case.<br><br>Shame if that's the case. The designers/developers of that were on to something really great with that editor.<br><br>I'd always wondered when someone else would pick up on the brilliance of working with simple subtracted/added volumes to create world geometry. Unreal level design is soo much faster and easier to work with because of that.. at least the laying out of base level geometry.<br><br>Instead of dealing with 6 separate "brushes" to create a simple room, as with Quake-style editors, you do it in 1 or 2 simple steps. Then, with the "quake method", there's the ever-present risk of two brushes not connecting by like, 1 unit, and throwing off all the Vis calculations, confusing the engine as to what's inside the level versus outside, hurting frame-rate, etc. Even if your level geometry is perfectly lined up during construction, if the accuracy is a little off during compilation, it can actually create leaks. It's just an arduous and messy process.. I never liked using Quake-style editors (Worldcraft, QuARK, etc).<br><br>By their nature a "subtracted" or "carved" volume as created in Maplet/UnrealEd is air-tight... never a problem of leaks (unless an outside surface is flagged as transparent or something like that - but that's user error)<br><br>In any case.. great concept, nice approach to leveling.. using the grid as a guide to make sure things are lining up right... be great to see what it could grow into with continued development. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you didn't stop it applying the same thing multiple times the frame rate would drop seriously low while your finger is on the key. <br><br>Once you apply the texture, there is no way of knowing what rotation it was at when you did, so it doesn't know if the rotation changes. <br><br>I could probably find a workaround on it, but I'm hoping to do a new 'DecoratorMAX' when the BlitzMax 3D Module is released, so it doesn't seem worth it at the moment. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
