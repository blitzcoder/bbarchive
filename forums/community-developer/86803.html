And if low poly is what you want it could be all you ever need.<br><br>Blender is a lot more sophisticated. And free!<br><br>Poser is, as Matty says, irrelevant for 3d work. But could be worth looking at if you need to render sprites for a 2d game. Somewhat pricey and you would inevitably end up spending more on addons.<br><br>Key things to look for imho - stability and a fair-sized helpful community - the things that keep me going with B3d rather than looking at other game engines. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

While someone could use one of the many free bvh files around the 'net, at least with the walk designer you can adjust the walking to your character... which is helpful, since animating a walk cycle is a difficult thing to get right.<br><br>Amanda, do you want a program to model characters, or animate them as well? To help you, maybe you could share with us what you're hoping to do, and how much exposure to modelling you have (and animation, if relevant). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
