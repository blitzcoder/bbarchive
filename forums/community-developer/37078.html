Neither the Ydnar q3 bsp improve on it, as was based on the id bsp compiler.<br>- As far as I know Blitz3d only uses quake 3 BSPs.<br>-There's a freeware bsp compiler, but the bsp probaly is not exactly a q2 or q3 one, but seems is given the code, the format specs, a compiler, and what could be an advanced editor. Getic, is called. The author posted in BC forums, and I posted way many times the link, and all the links on this theme. Maybe this could be a way to go , at least for experienced coders...<br>- You can use the Zoner ZHLT compiling tools, be sure on grabbing the last one. Again, all the link sshould be in that huge database that maybe now BC forums...<br><br>-A free map editor, quite advanced, and totally free, is QUARK. It exports hallife maps, and qake, heretic, many games maps...but u allways need to configure and use a compiler with it... <br>- There's a wip project, seems not very usable yet, of a totally free q3 bsp compiler. <br><a href="http://map3bspc.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">http://map3bspc.sourceforge.net</a><br>If it were ended (I think is missing the lightmaps stuff, but don't quote me on this) then you'd have the land clear.  Use the quark editor and this compiler would allow totalluy free Q3 BSPs production for comercial projects. So , thi sis the third way of producing a bsp (the 3 then are: a q3 bsp-this method- , the non standard bsp with Getic, and a HL BSP with Quark (Quake Army Knife) compiled with the zhlt tools. and of course, Jedive's tool, which maybe quite easier to handle, probably.  )<br><br>-I don't know of a free for comercial q2 bsp compiler. But indeed, seems the only thing that Blitz3d loads is q3 bsps. <br>And please, see that is possible legally, for all said above...<br><br>Anyway....BSPs have a very limited geometry generation, for the way it is. Also, these editors use to be quite limited, I tested the Unreal Editor and liked it much more; even though, I personally prefer do it all in my modeller, and have the coder do the exporter in c++ for the engine, hehe... ;)<br><br>I mean, I rather prefer to output an OBJ, load in Giles, make great lightmaps there, export the two uv channels mesh, with the lightmap and really complex geometry, and give that to the engine. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
