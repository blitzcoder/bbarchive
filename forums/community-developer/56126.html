Not since they added the seam visualisation. you can do a quick auto Unwrap and then drag and weld parts that you want to fit together. <br><br>That way you can fit a lot more in your texture page if you join that parts that can be joined and still have lightmap correctly. Particularly useful for long fairly thin objects that waste a lot of empty UV space if they are all sepperated by 2 pixels of padding.<br><br>I havent used Giles in a while, not sure if it lets you adjust your UV's and scale them manualy etc. But when I used it, it would leave huge empty spaces with certain large odd shaped geometry.<br><br>If you are going to use max for lighting, Bakersfield is far better than the default tools for streamlining the process, and doesn't have the UV channel 3 reset bug.<br><br>It may look a little daunting at first, but it really isn't, and it saves all your scene node setup data wit hyour files, so its easy to come back to and re render later without having to resort your meshes. <br><br><a href="http://www.chuggnut.com/scripts/bakersfield/bakersfield.htm" target="_blank">http://www.chuggnut.com/scripts/bakersfield/bakersfield.htm</a><br><br>One of the nicest things in Giles, at least I think so, is that it is material based, so you don't have to mess around with combining objects to have them share a texture page.<br><br>Giles is cheap enough that it's almost worth it as a quick unwrap tool. And for a lot of things, particularly time critical it's probably going to be a life saver. <br><br>Can take a day to set up efficient UV's for a large level by hand, and often another to get the lighting how you want it. So something like Giles would make for a nice quick pass, and may be enough for all your needs.<br><br>If you use pipeline for everything else though, the custom pipeline material probably isn't going to pass between the two apps very well. And neither is it compatible with the lightmapping in max. If your using fairly complex materials, you need 2 sets of materials, standard max ones for the max renderer, and your pipeline brush materials for rendering the final result in  blitz3d.<br><br>That alone can be quite time consuming :( <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There are some benefits to just using giles as the starting point to getting your UV's started, that alone will save you a fair ammount of time.

In the means he hardly can be considered a naysayer ;)<br><br>He meant some color in the shadows. I am an oil painter. A very realistic one, so I know pretty well what he refers  to. No shadow is plain grey. In real life, a lot of them   have subtle pale blueish tones. In certain areas, and very subtle and feathered. But it depends on the lighting othe rlight sources, color of near objects...That is...radiosity. Yup, Giles does radiosity, and looking just at the primitives example, looks like is pretty able to do that, just is surely some setting. I have Giles since long, but have not used strongly, but enough, imho. <br><br>Is  a good tool, and can achieve great results. Imho, not at the level of Finarl Render or Vray, or a well used Mental Ray, but of a very high quality, anyway. I yet to see a render of the quality of th every top of those renderers. But that is too ask way way too much to a what is already a fantastic and very realistic easy to use lightmapper.And that i have not seen em, can be just as typical Giles user is not interested in reach that point and hours.An engine like Blitz3d, seems  to burn a bit the shades, and stuff like that. So not so much point, and also, as one usually aims to a shareware game.<br><br>Lightmapping issues are mostly uv mapping. The rendering is like all kind of rendering, almost: lighting, materials, etc.<br><br>Max(haven't tried this in max 7 or 8) does not have what I could call an easy and fast automatic uv mapper and packer for levels. I'd prefer something better. Like many maxers do.  But it did the work fo rme in a very large and  complex pair of levels long ago.<br><br>There are better uv mapping generators/packers. Even free ones, like the famous open source fsrad. It has so much other problems that is not usuable for comercial products, imho. Yet a great point to start for a coder.<br><br>I'd love is Max would have a better uvmapping and packing tool for a level. Actually the key is usually..keep detail areas bigger, etc. It does not force you to do big or small areas. You  can configure it as u want, and actually , there's some editing needed after, like enlarging detail areas (ie, windows, etc) in the uvmaps. I see it uber powerful, like most in max. But i have tested other lightmappers (fsrad) where the uv mapping in second channel (usually 3 in Max, but u can configure that) is..what should be...fast, great, and no need of post edit: you can concentrate then just in lighting and the scene, as should be.  Fsrad even does chunks it in small tgas, that get automatically applied. The fact is little to no people knows even how to do this or handle. Same happens with the much well known Max lightmapping and also with Giles. No that I am a freaking master of any, but I know what can be done. And can anyone decided could do wonder with the 3. Just fsrad wont treat well curved surfaces, so for me is of no use.<br><br>The preview system is great in Giles.<br>It solves many problems you can do the same or better in Max with deep Max knowledge.That's one of the reasons why (besides Max price) Giles in indy world is a winner.<br><br>But I know what Evak was referring to(color on shadows). He's extremely good at level editing.<br><br>I'd add my two other cents (I see points to improve in all my graphic work, even when considered finished by my bosses...I just shut up them, hehe ) : A bit of dirt, a very subtle layer in like 15%...on the wood boxes...they're too clean and new for the purpose.<br><br>But...I would not touch the scene. Is a pain once lightmapped. Is great to go. :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
