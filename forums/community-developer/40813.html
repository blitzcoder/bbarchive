I had played around with the demo for a while, and finally decided to buy it. The layers obviously have transperency, but it's not saved when using any other format than .oci. Should I create the alpha manually and save it out seperately, so I can later combine it with the image in GIMP? Or is there an easier way.<br><br> Ragnar <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

And yep, java apps use to have great support of that...but usually game engines eat better the alpha old channel.  besides, I keep liking to be able to edit in rgb the greys, and b/w of the channel as a bitmap, gives loads of more of flexibility if actually needed.<br><br>That is, u need Gimp just for openning and saving to tga, which I recommend. But only that.No combine or nothing. though for use an alpha channeled thing in Ultimate Unwrap, u need to extract as a bmp the channel, and load in its slot in uu, or at least, i could not make the tga work with its channel in it...go guess..<br><br>But ur actual question is just what I told u :)<br><br>Hope that it helped...<br><br>yes, oci is native of open canvas.... and dunno of any converter for that...<br><br>bTW, what i use is the free 72 beta.  All in japanese and all...<br><br>And that when I don't feel in the mood  of using the blinking undo of Pixia, or the non pressure sensivity of Gimp...or the limioted set of tools, and a bit slower performance in stroke of art rage...<br><br>Sometimes I think I could just use my Zbrush or deep paint3d in 2d mode, but I don't really feel well with them for plain 2d.<br><br>Nope, nothing like open canvas, for me...wether the older or the new one...<br><br>Well, nothing better than an staedletter 2B ... ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I got it working fine through PSD and GIMP. I did send a mail to the author of Xnview suggesting that he add support for .oci files...so maybe we'll get a converter there.<br><br>So far I'm very happy with openCanvas, having just used the proper version for one day. I read through the manual, and found it had lots more functions than I knew about, and lots of handy keyboard shortcuts for adjusting the tools (brush size, swtiching brushes, etc.). Seems like a good choice for those of us who can't afford Photoshop, or just don't care to spend that much money on a paint app.<br><br> Ragnar <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
