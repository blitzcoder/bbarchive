I would like to team up with someone and finish my world building app.  If you are not local, then we could always team up via the internet.  It's just easier to be in the same place to get ideas off the ground in a timely manner - I've noticed.<br><br>To be honest, all the world builders (I won't name names to be kind) I have tried (and purchased half of them) to use are too darn slow. They get incredibly bogged down and the FPS becomes terrible (like around 5FPS). I am not talking about cartography shop, which I find works great for creating objects - but not worlds. I call a level a "world".<br><br>I created a large test terrain (on the same computer as the above bogged down world creators) and filled it with many objects (houses, trees, grass, plants, etc) and the FPS never even approached 60FPS - so why was mine so much faster? The movement system was that of mouselook and the arrow keys. It was fluid and smooth.<br><br>Anyway, so I need someone who is more proficient than I to help me get this testbed idea into a fully functional app. and then possibly even create some nice games after. I already have an artist and all sound and music is covered.<br><br>Anyone interested?<br><br>Mike Felker <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You will be able to put sound fx, particle emitters, music, lights, etc in your world.  Another part of the program will enable you to create your HUD or graphical GUI for the player and finally you will be able to tie in all of the above (multiple levels) into a finished entity - with custom loaders and exit animations, music, etc.<br><br>It will be very comprehensive and - above all - must not get bogged down with large worlds.  That last part requires a lot of low poly objects or conversion so the detail is not so big - it's always a trade off between quality and quantity / frame rate.<br><br>Mike <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Essentially, GECKO is a whole bunch of editors that tie in together step-by-step so that the end result is a playable game for the end user.<br><br>If you have any wish lists, let me know.  Also, I really am looing for a proficient coder to help make this a reality FASTER.  I could probably do it alone (given several years) - but I would like to see this finished IN MY LIFETIME.  LOL.<br><br>Anyone interested please ask - I could use the help.<br><br>Is this to be sold?  Probably - it's a lot of hard work and the end result will be a phenomenal editor toolset that would be invaluable to Blitz3D coders and artists / level builders.<br><br>Mike <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Do you want some constructive criticism?<br><br>On the plus side, I did not get any bogged down frame rate.<br><br>On the minus side, it was TOTALLY confusing to use.  The mouse control, while ok, was not intuitive at all.  Why restrict the user from looking down?  There was no way to pitch, roll or yaw the mouse to look at other angles?<br><br>I highly suggest using diffeent camera angles for placement purposes.  For example, a top down camera (looking from directly overhead) would allow for more exact placement, then a user would press a gadget to go to another window view of the same scene - just about every modelling program on the planet can do this.<br><br>Can you edit terrain with this program?
