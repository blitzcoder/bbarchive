I am sorry to hear that you haven't seen a penny in sales.  That is not on.<br><br>@DoctorWho - I will look into getting Gile[s] at some point because I have heard nothing but good things about it but yesterday I purchased TerraEd, BlitzGrass, BlitzTree and Particle Candy so the software buying funds are a bit depleted this month!! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I would seriously advise you to download the most recent version of gile[s] and do a re-evaluation of it again as I think you might of missed alot!!!<br><br><br><div class="quote"> I don't like knocking other peoples stuff generally, but I'm so sick of people kicking LB in the face when it does a perfectly good job, is cheap, and can be used for level design as well - time to retaliate. <br></div><br><br>Well... I wasn't intentionaly meaning to knock your software man! But I was just merly giving a suggestion to a fellow developer of the excellent quality that gile[s] produces! I downloaded your LightBulb lightmapper and tryied it out. It does a fairly decent job on lightmapping as well... But when I tried gile[s] out, Im' sorry to say to you!! It's far more advanced than LightBulb, And you get more professional results with it!! Like Rob said just a moment ago... Gile[s] lightmapping capabilities is even far better than that of 3D Studio Max!!! It's a tough product to beat!! Fredborg has done his homework very dam well and has produced a masterpiece!!!<br><br><div class="quote"> LB might not have a flashy GUI, but it does more then most people realise and its easy to use. <br></div><br><br>LightBulb is fine the way it is... And yes it's easy to use as well! And it's fine for what it is capable of. But instead of saying <b>"time to retaliate"</b>, Why not put your excellent skill's to work and make a <b>LightBulb 2</b> ? Your obviously an excellent coder or you wouldn't of turned out a very nice product like LightBulb. So.... Why not start on a newer Light mapper and let's see how interesting it can actually get?!? So what do you think?<br>I think it's a good idea!!<br><br><div class="quote"> @Daz <br></div><br><br><div class="quote"> I will look into getting Gile[s] at some point because I have heard nothing but good things about it but yesterday I purchased TerraEd, BlitzGrass, BlitzTree and Particle Candy so the software buying funds are a bit depleted this month!! <br></div><br><br>Wow man!! Sounds like you cranked up on the tool's huh?<br>You should be able to turn out some nice stuff with all of that! But in all due respects to <b>Skitchy</b> above in all, I still recommend gile[s] very much so! But don't take my word for it. download the trial and see for yourself! You wont be disappointed!!!<br><br><br><div class="quote"> @Rob <br></div><br><br><div class="quote"> Times move on, be graceful and accept defeat :) Lightbulb is a lovely product but it's had it's day.

Or make a LightBulb 2 instead! I personaly thank Skitchy for creating such a fine product to add to our community to help all of us out in our on projects. Skitchy, I encourage you to improve on LightBulb or make a possibly LightBulb 2 in comparison to that of giles[s]. I wish you all the best! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
