(I don't think I can do that in Lightwave Layout - bones are needed to animate the model). LWRigidConv.exe doesn't work at all for animated models apparently. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you have more, these will need to be flattened to one layer before exporting to .B3D (This 1 layer limitation is only for deforming animation, you can use as many layers as you like in the 'Rigid' convertor, but bones deformation animation is not supported in the rigid one because it is, well rigid :)<br><br>In summary, you need to have all geometry in the first layer for bone deforming animation. The second layer can have either nothing or Skelegons in it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That's just what I was hoping to hear! Do you know if Milkshape supports the importing of animation information for the Wavefront (.obj) file format? If so, output from Messiah:animate could also be used to get animated objects into Blitz3D. (Messiah:animate is fantastic because of its awesome 'autorig' skinning, and 'muscle-bone' technology - I'm considering purchasing it - although not cheap, you get what you pay for I suppose - unfortunately the demo version of it doesn't support saving or exporting).<br><br>Lee: I was able to get Deform to read my .LWS scene file by moving the skelegons in the model (.LWO) file into layer 2. However, when I load the resulting .b3d file into Blitz3D and then use the command "Animate model_handle, 2" command (or "Animate model_handle,2,1,0"), I'm still not seeing any animation. <br><br>Perhaps I'm not using the 'Animate' command correctly? From the Blitz documentation, it seems to me that if I wanted to see my animation ping-pong back and forth from start to finish I would only have to issue this command once, rather than continually run it inside the main game loop. (I apologize for this newbie question about animation -- perhaps I should ask it in another thread, but I just want to make sure I'm not doing anything else wrong.)<br><br>Another thing regarding the Rigid.exe program I am confused about. It says it allows multi-layered objects to be animated, but doesn't support deformation, just rotation and positioning information. Does this mean it supports endomorphs but not bone manipulation? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

(I assumed I must be doing something wrong in Blitz3D). However, I'll try and send you the lightwave model (.lwo) and scence (.lws) files.  <br><br>DangerDave: I found out that the OBJ file format does not contain animation information. Apparently, the export options in messiah:animate only export static models - animation information is evidently transferred to other 3D applications like Lightwave (and 3d Studio Max, Maya, Cinema 4D) via plug-ins. <br><br>By the way, messiah:animate is a great application for animation, as it features some really nice tools for speeding up game animation workflow. For example, it's AutoRig feature creates a skeleton "armature" which only needs to have a few points dragged to the appropriate place in a model; skinning (vertex weighting for realistic mesh deformation) is automatic! (Although it can be easily tweaked with a neat tool from inside messiah). So the whole step of skinning a model is basically done away with! "Muscle-bones" (bones that automatically deform a mesh as if muscles were contracting), and easy bone mirroring and editing are also some other cool features.<br><br>Since messiah will work seamlessly with Lightwave, if I could just get the model and animation output from a Lightwave scene file into Blitz3D format, I'd have a complete Level and model animation workflow established:<br><br>For level design and architecture:<br>SketchUp &gt; gile[s] &gt; .b3d<br><br>For modeling and animation (using messiah:animate):<br>Lightwave &gt; messiah &gt; Lightwave &gt; .lws (scene file) &gt; [conversion program] &gt; Blitz3D (.b3d) <br><br>For modeling and animation (using gameSpace):<br>gameSpace &gt; Milkshape &gt; Blitz3D (.b3d)<br><br>Neither <a href="http://www.sketchup.com/" target="_blank">SketchUp</a> nor <a href="http://www.projectmessiah.com/" target="_blank">messiah</a> are cheap, but for professional work, they are very nice indeed, which is what I am looking to use them for. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In my newbie confusion I didn't remove 'Ground' from the schematic view in Layout, but I'm still a bit confused about the instructions for setting up the file for conversion.

Layout created bones reside in layer 1 (along with the model)."<br><br>I thought that meant that in Layout, the model and its  bones should all reside in layer 1. It appears now that I took that the wrong way, and that they should be on separate layers, even in Layout. However, Lightwave puts converted skelegons as bones into layer 1. Sorry for the confusion, and thanks for your help. :)<br><br>For me, in the long run this probably won't be an issue, as I would like to use messiah:animate for character animation, and it doesn't export bones to Lightwave, but (I think?) it exports vertex animation.

I can't really test exactly what messiah:animate exports to Lightwave because the demo version of it doesn't allow saving or exporting of any kind. I'll probably end up having to use 3D GameStudio or TrueVision3D for my game project for use with messiah:animate.
