Germany is one of those countries, and I think we are the only country in the world where Microsoft is forced to sell OEM/Systembuilder versions of their software to end users and where they cannot enforce the bundling with hardware. For once, German courts did the right thing with that 'OEM ruling'. Still, we need many more lawsuits and decisions like that one. For example, although I am an Apple customer, I would just LOVE to see a court decision that would force them to make OS X available for non-Apple hardware. But that is a different story.<br><br>Although Germany has a law that prohibits the removal of "functioning" copy protection mechanisms from software or CDs/DVDs, we also do have a law that actually allows people to make a copy of a music CD or movie as long as you are in the possession of the original media when you copy it. You do not have to be the owner of that original media; it can be a rented CD. Of course, this is only for personal/private use. And if my information is still valid, this law (or exception to a law)  still hasn't changed. I doesn't extend to software, though.<br><br>Illegal software:<br>Well, I do NOT use pirated software. Once you've worked for a software company that went bankrupt, your attitude towards software piracy changes significantly when you have to live off your credit card for a couple of months while at the same time you can find illegal copies of your software on the eDonkey network.<br><br>Still, I do not support copy protection "solutions" in any way and think that suing your own customers is the stupidest thing you can possibly do in this business.<br><br>About the harassment business here:<br>I don't know what thread you guys are talking about, but if somebody openly said that he was using pirated software, than the thread was rightfully deleted in my opinion. When you are a software company like BRL, you cannot allow your customers make you look as if you are condoning the use of illegal software by letting them post messages like this on your public forums. There are also legal terms for that if you do, and BRL could probably even be sued for it.<br><br>If you want to be respected as a professional, no matter what business you are in, do not use stolen software, tools or other equipment.<br><br>If you cannot afford the software that you want to use, either find some legal funding for it or bite in the sour apple and look for open source alternatives.<br><br>Also, there usually is the option of purchasing a legal older version of the software. I doubt that you will always need the shiniest latest and greatest. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
