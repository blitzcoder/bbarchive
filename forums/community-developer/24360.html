It's been steadily developed for over two years, has tons of features and is, IMO, fairly intuitive to use. Recently the ability to export the FBX format for models built in Wings3D has been introduced as a separate plugin. Motion Builder uses FBX as do several other 3D oriented converters and programs. <br>While my own models are not too sophisticated, I've read in the Wings forums where other Wings users have had very good success in exporting complex models in the FBX format to other programs including MB I believe.<br>While Wings3D and the FBX plugin are still "works in progress" I heartily recommend them for serious modeling. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Without getting into the boring history, 3ds is the file format of a predecessor to 3D Studio Max (and dxf is the predecessor to the predecessor!) and obj is the file format of a predecessor to Maya.  Virtually nothing actually imports .max and .mb files (3D Studio Max and Maya, respectively) directly.<br><br>My question springs from the fact that regardless of fbx file format containing more information than 3ds or obj, Wings3D does not.  Wings3D is a polygonal modeling tool, with support for texture coordinates; no other sorts of data (eg. other sorts of geometry, lights, and cameras) are supported by Wings3D.  So, unless Motion Builder cannot import 3ds or obj, exporting directly to fbx is kind of pointless. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I think bjorn himself has done the coding. As always with Wings, it will probably be a WIP for awhile.<br><br>@dangerdave99 - FBX is what you might consider a "neutral" 3d file format, perhaps more so than 3ds or obj. I'm still learning about it myself so I hope my statement doesn't sound too silly. <br><br>The problem I've seen in other 3D formats is that in general, the converters for them do not always support all the format options.. I think FBX is a move to produce a self contained "generic" 3D format. obj, while a great 3d format,uses constructs to build spline-based structures, not always supported in code. I believe 3ds has some of the same issues, especially in models that are animated.<br><br>[EDIT] I believe Sybixus is correct as well. With the new features that are being created for animation and rigging, the FBX format will (when completed) allow seamless integration/translation between 3D programs such as Maya and MB. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
