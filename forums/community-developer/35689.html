Is this just because the TerraEd demo uses the biggest map you could create with TerraEd?  Is Blitz3D just slow?  Or is the demo just programmed really poorly with a faulty main loop?<br><br>I have noticed that the editor itself (TerraEd 2.exe) seems to run very slowly, too, and doesn't refresh very often.  (~5fps) I was wondering if anybody else experiences this?  Or does EVERYBODY else experience this, and this is just one of the quirks of working with Blitz?<br><br>I noticed that the realitime shiny water demo was nice and fast, but the example file with the birds flying through the canyons was really slow.  So maybe it all depends on how a user programs their main loop?  If so, then I hope the author of TerraEd learns how to write a better main loop.  If not, then I hope Blitz3D gets more efficient.<br><br>If the problem is my NVidia GeForce4 Ti 4400, then I think I will cry. :( <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In my current project I started from a blank terrain and have at the moment just over 1,700 entities placed over the terrain without any noticeable drop in FPS. It is slightly slower on my laptop but the graphics card is one of those cheap built in things so can't really complain about that. My GFX card on the main PC is a FX5200, nothing special, AMD1.7 and 256mb. I assume everybody has the latest drivers for there GFX cards?
