It is pretty good value for money.  It has a fairly powerful scripting engine, pretty good client/server functionality, stuff like the world editor is built into the engine and if the scripting language doesn't allow you to achieve what you want to, you do get the entire engine source code to play with.  The downfall is the source is written  in C++.  If you have never done C++ before, it isn't the easiest language to start out with.  <br><br>My vote would go with Blitz3d though.  You just have more flexibility.  In my opinion, if you are willing to pay extra cash, you have some great libraries and tools such as TerraEd, BlitzTree, BlitzGrass, Gile[s], Particle Candy,  BlitzVM, BCF Gui as well as recent integration with libs like Tokamak. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The terrain editing in Torque is great but some of the other features could do with a bit of an update.  I guess what you have to understand is the core Torque engine is quite a few years old now.  I heave heard mutterings about Torque v2 but I have yet to see any screenshots etc.   <br><br>Actually, it seems that Eole's forthcoming GeoSpace terrain tool may work in a similar way to Torque's terrain functions.  If that is the case, I will be one happy chappy!! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I found that - as Rob pointed out - the art path is a huge problem. For me, that's the single most important thing, because it scuppers you before you even start. Terrains are lovely, for sure, but a knackered art path is just a recipe for many long nights screaming and punching the desk. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
