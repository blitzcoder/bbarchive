It seems like the $100 version is all you really need for game development, which is pretty damn cheap. The truth is, I have zero talent for animation ( just check out those hugarian washer women or however parrot described the original Tennis Babes animations I did to find proof of this statement ) and I need a lot of animations. I could hire an animator, I could license them from a motion capture studio or I could have another go at doing them myself. Anyone tried Animanium able to suggest whether it's worth me investing some time and $100 in trying to improve my own skills? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's pretty odd and counter-intuitive at first, which is why I was asking for anyone who's spent more time with it than me.

I think though, that CAT plugin for Max is one of the nicest thing around for animation.

I can animate averagely well in CS and Max, indeed, been part of my work lately, in game jobs. But I know cs has quite some weird things that it shouldn't have and it has certainly room for improvement. there's where something like cat could win. yet though, once again, xsi was better solution for me. But if you aim to not complex stuff, that's then the worst way. So maybe animanium is not bad idea. have you guessed if you can export as x ? if not, is not of much use... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
