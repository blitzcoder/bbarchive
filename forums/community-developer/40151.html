It may not be as customizable as Maya or easy-to-use as Max, but its price is hard to beat.<br><br>Maya<br>$1995 (Windows, Mac, Unix; free crippled version available; more expensive version available)<br>3d modelling, texture mapping and painting, rendering, animation, etc.<br>scriptable (MEL)<br><a href="http://www.alias.com" target="_blank">http://www.alias.com</a><br><br>Comments: generally considered the best all-round piece of 3D software for rendered CGI production on the planet.<br><br>Softimage XSI<br>$495 (Windows, Unix; base version; pricier versions available)<br>3d modelling, texture mapping, rendering, animation, etc.<br>scriptable<br><a href="http://www.softimage.com" target="_blank">http://www.softimage.com</a><br><br>Comments: generally considered the second-best all-round piece of 3D software for rendered CGI production on the planet, now at a bargain price (albeit with limited feature set compared to the $2000-ish rival products).<br><br>Lightwave 3D<br>$895, $495 "sidegrade" (Windows, Mac, Unix)<br>3d modelling, texture mapping, rendering, animation, etc.<br>scriptable<br><a href="http://www.newtek.com" target="_blank">http://www.newtek.com</a><br><br>Comments: generally considered the most under-rated 3D software for rendered CGI production on the market. Very popular in Europe and Japan. Has a rather odd interface and internal workflow that some find infuriating (basically the modelling and animation portions of the program are separate quasi-integrated programs and some features are only available in one or the other).<br><br>3D Studio Max<br>$3495 (Windows)<br>3d modelling, texture mapping, rendering, animation, etc.<br>scriptable<br><a href="http://www.discreet.com" target="_blank">http://www.discreet.com</a><br><br>Comments: originally the upstart product that showed Windows could do 3D as well as high end Unix work stations, Max is now more expensive than its high end rivals while lacking some of their features. Max is probably the most widely used 3D package for game content creation, followed by Maya and Lightwave.<br><br>The latest version includes Character Studio (which used to be a pricey add-on).<br><br>Truespace<br>3d modelling, texture mapping, rendering, animation, etc.<br>scriptable (Python)<br><a href="http://www.caligari.com" target="_blank">http://www.caligari.com</a><br><br>Comments: has a unique interface and is quirky, but offers incredible value for money.<br><br>Gamespace<br>3d modelling, texture mapping, rendering, animation, etc.<br>scriptable (Python)<br><a href="http://www.caligari.com" target="_blank">http://www.caligari.com</a><br><br>Comments: basically a version of Truespace focussed on the hobbyist game developer market.

I have no idea where inferior functionality comes from, because Max 7 is now an equal ( or better ) to anything for character animation, which is the only area it was ever lacking in.<br><br>It's also the package with the best integration with Blitz3d, thanks to Pipeline, and that is really worth noting, since all the other expensive packages are lacking in that area, and integration with your engine is vital for game development.<br><br>If Maya and Softimage are "generally considered" #1 and #2, I'm curious why Max is the most widely used package for gamedev. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

A funny thing is that most game-engines from Europe have great Lightwave support, like www.quest3d.com , while engines from the US mostly have great MAX support.<br>Also...personally i don't think the GUI is "weird". It actually makes more sense to me then most tools. When i for example want to extrude a face i simply click the extrude button...not an icon with a blue cube on it with strange red lines and a red arrow pointing different ways.<br><br>Modo is also heavily influenced  by Lightwaves modeller.<br><br>Ah well, i'm just a newtek-junky i guess :-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I've found that a lot of studios use both Max and Maya. Max primarily for realtime modeling. And most often of all for Interiors and scenery. <br><br>Maya is often used if animators prefer it. Most studios still use their own engines, or highly modified versions of existing engines that have custom art pipelines you don't get out of the box.<br><br>I don't actually know very many developers that use Lightwave at all except for their FMV work. And FMV often depends on who's doing it, quite often its outsourced so who knows. <br><br>But for realtime graphics Max is used the most by far and maya is still a bit behind. XSI and Lightwave probably have less than 20% combined when it comes to realtime game graphics and this is a huge improvement over a coule of years ago. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

No discussion.  But this is a game dev place ;)<br><br>Nope, Max have tools not present in 2 years ago Maya. Normal maps generation inside the tool (I think present now in maya)<br><br>I have been working at a company using both Maya and Max..Max gave less problems in game dev. <br><br>For me in gamedev..is all about max, sorry. While Maya and XSI can do nice things, too.<br><br>Sorry, Silo is *not* a much improved Wings. To me Wings is clearly superior in organic modelling. Other thing is, like in Zbrush 2.0, they attracted cleverly outstanding artists. give em a piece of rock and they'll do wonders...<br>Still I think that topology brush is useful.<br><br>You forgot to mention (i know as I purchased it) that zbrush produces a blur with any "pick" that people cure with repainting..not so good for low pol texturing painting so like Deep Paint3d (also registered user)<br>And the UI could be better. I'd say just 2.0 rocks for normal maps/displacement generation, and hi res modelling detailling. <br><br>XSI has an outstanding character animation system and x export (3v3n the 500$ version) pretty usable for game dev in conjunction with Ultimate Unwrap.<br><br>Sorry, ultimate Unwrap is the best uv mapping out there even at a much higher price range. One has to know deeply uv mapping , though. Autouv by no means can do accurate nice, clean , serious game uv mapping yet, while I agree is much more click and go, and is definitely a way to go.<br><br>Also, is one of the few ways to convert x animations (any package, like Maya) to b3d...<br><br>The lightwave comment..ahem...I have seen some godlike modelling , humans made in cg talk, a guy that learned witha book in a pair of months and did the best humans I've seen till today....<br><br>About the wings no interactive cage...well, it doesn't show in the proxy mode while you drag, but after you have dragged...Anyway, I got used to modelling organic the Mirai way, and have my mind built modelling in low cage allways. Is a discipline, u end up controlling that.But i agree would be nice that one, though imho, kills more performance in any package, and yet the other knoledge is so useful.<br><br>I see you forgot Blender but yet put character Fx...While the initial learning is way harder, the workflow is much cleverer in Blender, can do at least faked joint pining, has  modelling and rendering, can export to *.x (perfectly read now in Ultimate Unwrap with jox modified x exporting plugin) and a load more stuff not in Character Fx.Which got stuck in development long ago.<br><br>While I agree Character Fx is learnable, and Blender only with lots of patience and certain abilities, I would leave it out for many type of atists....<br><br>Anim8or is gonna be updated, but yep, compared to some of those monsters, not much power. yet is way easy to learn the firts steps.<br><br>I mean, the list is nice, just I though I'd mention that *in my opinion* many comments are...well...wrong...With all my respects...<br><br>I have done many stuff with Wings3d, Ultimate Unwrap, in a professional environment for AAA games... I had an strong fight to be allowed to do so, as Wings and Ultimate and not well known...Well, the quality and speed left no doubts and they let me continue using them as I wished. And lots of artwork done with those.<br><br>Many cg talk pros , Maya and XSI ppl I have seen, use Wings3d as their organic modeller, prefering it even to their purchased software. Not saying it's a big percentage, but some of them, and quite qualified...The Silo's UI does not convince me for organic, and I have used loads of different UIs (including Max, Blender, Zbrush, Amorphium,large etc..splines, polies, metaballs, etc,etc) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Not saying they arent used, With the Game devs I worked at in the past few years/. I used Max in the UK 1997-1998, lightwave and maya at the same company for 2 years in 1999-2001 and Maya and Max 2001-2002.<br><br>Maya was pretty poor for level and environment design until fairly recently but had very good spline and nurbs tools. It's caught up with max in this respect and judging by the currently avaliable about 90% of the positions on Gamasutra required either Max or Maya and only a couple mentioned lightwave and XSI as a viable alternaive.<br><br>It's unfortunate that game devs don't have the time to train staff in new tools, at the end of the day it's really hard to get a job if you don't have the right skills and at the moment it seems there are only 2 3D apps that will give you a sure shot at the majority of art and design related positions. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But I think the case of podPerson is that he's refering to the fact -and yes, that is a fact- that Wings3d Autouv actually includes certain ways of uv mapping that are quite advanced. You have automatic unwrapping methods (stream, ruling lines, spiral ) in UU, but not allways work well...In wings Autouv you can set the edges that will be the "borders" and it automatically unwraps that. It's cool, and have been announced loudly in cgTalk, but...many hi res people don't mess that much with careful uv mapping; (in hi res u have blending materials to hide characters seams, very hi res modelling features, huge materials sizes, etc) also, is different animal, some of the old techniques are not ideal for very hi res models.<br><br>The fact is that...well, you don't have the needed control with AutoUv. It does an aproximation, but doesn't provide  real great flats... It's anyway, an easy-quick method for some cases... But at the end of the day, you need traditional old m apping to get a pro level human skin template, and much of the needed tools for that are missing clearly in AutoUv. It's slowly improving in that field, and I have huge hopes about it.<br><br>But I compare this with...a thought I have everytime I read -for example- that Blender will dominate the world of cg...it'll reach there , they say. No doubt it'll be as good as today is higgh end (or partially). but where will be then the tools that now are already better...? they wont stay quiet. Ultimate Unwrap 3.0, as mentioned, is getting real shape :) I know a bit the author, and he's a great developer. Dan is in charge of AutoUv, and also is a fantastic coder. But...it's so long way the one that Brad has done with UU... There are loads of tiny things so important when uv mapping in UU, that u don't notice till u get some expertise with it. Even loving Autouv, one has to have stuff clear in mind...<br><br>For me conversions are important (as many of em, uu is the only to do them: dx8 full animations, 2 uv channels support in mapping and conversions(for lightmaps, composite materials, etc), metasequoia mqo absolutely seamless support...Anim8or an8 (not enough info released for coders to make animation support, though, he told me) format(there's a blender export plugin I think, for torque, even..not sure now)...wc3 format, a load more. I have even edited old UT1 frames of main palyer animations, for a mod I worked at... )<br><br>Not to mention its permanent check of loaded texture; it detects any change in the file and refresh it continuously with no performance loss...ideal for 2d painting skinning style...just set the 2d painting tool and uu in mosaic windows, and hit ctrl+s in the 2d tool whenever wanna see the change in uu.<br><br>Max uv mapping tools are more game aimed than Maya, for example. And have an advantage over UU, that is the green coloring of the uv edges that are in touch in real 3d. I have handled to get guess stuff without it (so I notice it when I use Max at jobs)  but is a real advantage.<br><br>UU has other advantages over max uv system, like the ability to treat groups and objects just the same, as selections being able to work on any, at any moment,at same time...and divide as meshes at export time, as u prefer. OBJ plugins do help here, to.<br><br>That is: I'd rather prefer that the real revolutionary thing -pelting, already introduced by TS , somehow, long ago-  in uv, was added to UU, rather than add all what uu has to Autouv, as there's a long way.<br><br>In the meantime, Dan seems really good and fast at it...and is really nice to have some uv mapping in Wings3d.<br><br>Blender has now this pelting methods too, and UU author has added a free external tool for it, but can't include inside UU as was basing on a library or something with GNU license.<br><br>Imho, Blender/Tuhopou2 is nearer a more complete uv mapping system, and yet so, imho is quite bellow UU, again.<br><br>And the fact Wings is so much easier (than both UU and Blender, but specially Blender.)<br><br>Autouv does not provide a 100% distortion free flats.(and u have to fix some overlaps, having less tools for that than in UU) If u want my opinion, good flats are does that are made manually, or with the old technique of morphing key in Max, or easier and quicker, chilliskiner plugin ( chilliweb.co.uk ) ...yet though that technique I don't like for organic characters, I prefer other methods like a lot of camera mapping and good editing before and sewing of sheets(Hyper methods, etc)... Eficient uv template use, and all that. Well, all that is required for good uv flats. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

When I have time I'll update the top post to add in all the things I've missed (and cases where I'm obviously wrong too ;) ).<br><br>Just for the record: I like Max. I own a copy. I know it better than pretty much any other 3D package. The main thing Max R7 can boast about for game developers is excellent support for normal maps.<br><br>Here's Max 7's Game Dev page (I couldn't find any feature overview, although there is a nice PDF file discussing the new features in Max 7):<br><br><a href="http://www4.discreet.com/3dsmax/3dsmax.php?id=974" target="_blank">http://www4.discreet.com/3dsmax/3dsmax.php?id=974</a><br><br>I have no doubt that Max is more widely used for PC and XBox game dev than Maya or Softimage. This is at least in part due to prices two or three years ago, when Maya Complete cost $8000. As a consequence of this, fewer artists have learned to use Maya than Max.<br><br>On the other hand, Lightwave and Maya are far more prevalent among PS2 and Nintendo game development. (Consider that the best selling games are PS2 and Nintendo titles.)<br><br>Max also has a pretty draconian licensing policy (e.g. when I moved from Australia to the USA I had to get special permission to get a new unlock key when I reinstalled Max). Maya is probably the same (it certainly was back when I worked in an SGI shop). Lightwave has far more reasonable licensing (and pricing).<br><br>Lightwave is an awesome product. I did not intend to disrespect it in any way, but it has an unusual interface both in terms of its philosophy and its use of custom widgets (which have been improved in recent versions), and the division of functionality into not-terribly-integrated-parts is annoying (to me, anyway). When I last used Lighrwave, it did not have a dependable UNDO, which is pretty horrifying compared to Max, say, which has both near unlimited undo and tweakable modifier pipelines.<br><br>You can buy XSI or Lighrwave for the cost of a Max upgrade. And Lighrwave will run cross-platform. (Yes Max has features that the base version of XSI, in particular, lacks, but few of them are relevant to game developers.)<br><br>Some additional links:<br><br>Softimage XSI feature comparison<br><a href="http://www.softimage.com/products/Xsi/v4/comparison/default.asp" target="_blank">http://www.softimage.com/products/Xsi/v4/comparison/default.asp</a><br><br>Note that the $500 version lacks polygon reduction tools, game engine integration (you can embed your game engine in a window of the pricier versions), floating licenses, and rigid body dynamics. Aside from that, it has everything a game developer would care about. Of these, Max offers the last for 7x the price, but you have to pay extra to fully enable it.<br><br>Also note cloth, quadruped, and fluid dynamics. Hmm, Max do those yet?<br><br>Here's Maya Complete vs. Unlimited:<br><a href="http://www.alias.com/eng/products-services/maya/technical_features/index.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.alias.com/eng/products-services/maya/technical_features/index.shtml</a><br><br>Again, the missing features are of more relevance to high end animation shops than game developers. Again, the "basic" product has features Max can't match.<br><br>Here's what passes for Lightwave's feature list (I can't understand why it has the stuff it has in it -- the top listed feature under animation is "squash and stretch", which is like saying you can make cubes in it...; but then they leave tons of stuff out):<br><br><a href="http://newtek.com/products/lightwave/product/list.html" target="_blank">http://newtek.com/products/lightwave/product/list.html</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's greatest strength is how flexible it is. You have MEL scripting built in, while not the greatest programming language, it lets you easily add your own functions to the software without having to dig into C++ and the SDK. I think the greatest strength is it's flexibility. It's easy to adapt to your in-house pipeline and to use in combination with other packages (modelers, animation tools, renderers etc.). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I did a course/master. I had 2d shaper, to build splines, 3d lofter, to make birail skinning, just lofting, and otehr ways. Then that went to the mesh editing main thing, and yet u had the IK mode (unconnected parts yet! no weights) , material editor...<br><br>But somewhat made an organized flow...<br>I really did hate when smashed all in one in Max1, and did those rolling menus. SO much... I stopped learning.<br><br>Now I'm used to the other way and can't switch back :D<br><br>But u'r al th etime doing so...I learnt Blender's UI...I had to learn Max and cs...I'm learning now XSI that I purchased....<br><br>XSI 4 foundation has way more than the usual game developer tool. i don't care any of the supposed ripped functions.<br>hair rendering, but not for games, just as I enjoy that. Could test in a job the lovely shag hair(free demo available) rendering , animation and gravity settings, and I'm told XSI hair is much better.<br><br>The joint pinning in XSI, the ik handling and bones building is lovely, really nice. The built in obj import and export, the more seamless I have. The dx *.x import and export downloadable addons, fully working here. :) (no other package that i used fully imports dx anims.)<br><br>I'm REALLY happy with it. yet though haven't put mor etime in it that checking i can do all what I needed, previous to purchase. I'm modelling with WIngs, and doing other stuff in ultimate unwrap and other tools, as of yet.(will keep so, probably...)<br><br>Polygon reduction..I have an old version of Vizup freeware(before) optimizer, which works quite well, metasequoia, and qslim, all them help me reduce the models, but i rarely do so , and never for games.<br><br>the game engine integration..that's a plus that no other package has...but if lacking in xsi, I don't care. besides having already obj and x great support, dotXSI ascii format excels for game engine exports, is quite easy for a coder, tons of doc available, sdk, etc...<br><br>Looking a bit more carefully in job offers...seems animators are asked often to use Maya, already, while character modellers, lightwave, Max. And level editing people, in blizzard and other places, I read Max. But non exclusively. Some years ago, Blizzard offers where clear. Max and only Max. Now they say "Max or equivalent package".  And as I say, in animation job, they say clearly Maya.<br><br>Yet though, animating in Character STudio is so easy...of course, a custom Maya rig would surpass that, but...It depends on the needs. To make several already Max based modellers help with anims in an overloaded team, is quicker and easy teach em some notions bout CS than learn a whole new package like Maya.<br><br>Indeed, some of the greatest game animators I've seen, prefer Max bones +ik+helpers+dummies, in complex workflows (more similar to Maya's ways) than CS.<br><br>Skullbox prefers Max bones and still use the Character Studio weighting tool, Physique. And I can tell he's a real kickass animating guy...He puts such lovely secondary animation in his beasts...and amazingly quick.<br><br>While I do can animate with Max bones, I personally prefer using cs biped for speed reasons (have animated with raw bones&amp;weights in other packages(character FX, Blender, Anim8or)) while skin modifier (strongly improved in max6 and 7) for skin weights.<br><br>I have seen in two companies that max simply will cover ANY need in game production. When u'r a gfx slave, that's really apreciated.<br><br>For the place where it comes from, Maya imho is making a huge effort to get the shape of something it was not made for . It was made as a real professional tool for film making. Still, I see how a lot of studios (funnily, the price thing may not be so important, many of em are the ones with more money, demanding way more animation quality, and they know several kickass animators are flowing from film industry towards gaming; I guess some houses may have maya to use those guys...Others simple need the flexibility of Maya in animations (nodes relations, etc))<br><br>One package I would have REALLY loved to have used in game dev, is Mirai. I wont speak about it, but the ik, the modelling everything is so sweet (Ray Baitts did work on Gollum, and other beasts in LOTR with it)<br><br>IMHO, any of these Mirai, Maya, Lightwave, can be used in AAA game developing. Is a matter of...most were not done with mainly games in mind, but higher targets. Max is already customized for that, and to keep in competition, has added a lot of work in postediting, fx, etc...<br><br>i see there's a lot of ppl don't know the whole set of features of max..heck, I don't either...is too big :) But I realize...the ui is shocking for many people... others find it easier to learn than Maya.<br><br>yet so, I wouldn't recommend using Max "as is" .there's aloads of plugins there. Modelling organic with old Evak times in game dev he refers too, sure was moe painfull. You can get many Mirai like modelling , right click floating menus stuff, edge loop modelling with things like meshtools Script, Orion, Polymagus, Unrapper, etc...Using a "clean" max for organic modelling could be a pain, yet though, I've done so, and I see it quite functional, anyway. Max 6, and mostly 7, has took note of that, and now modelling in Max7 is rather better than ever was.<br><br>I think u can model weherever..only I dig for is packages that wont leave me out in the rain for a total lack of a feature. I prefer to do it hardly than not being able to do it at all; is proved that an artist can learn anything. But can't do one thing that the package can't do.<br>Anyway, a non distracting, quick, flexible UI for modelling is a need. I guess I'll keep using Wings wherever the job I go...it's so quick a powerful for characters. I used max mainly as the integration tool, even uvmapped with Ultimate. heck, I wonder how I never got the sack ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
