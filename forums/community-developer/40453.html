A good tool can save you so much time (eg. TerraEd has saved me LOADS of time and produces results much better than I could have achieved), so I think people should be given as much 'chance' to buy it as possibe (as it may result in some nice games).<br><br>So, even though not 'immediatly' interested in this tool, I looked upon it with interest for the future. Although I got a good idea of what it 'probably' is, I too would feel uneasy about parting with my cash as the product was still a bit unclear to me. For example, how much freedom does the developer have, or conversely (as they as usualy inversely related to each other), how much work do 'I' have to put in.<br><br>JFK, maybe you should release a sample 'ini' file or something, letting people see how things are done. Obviously the file will not work on its own, but perhaps you could say 'this bit of the file creates the blah blah you see in the demo' or 'this is how you would create a NPC' etc etc.<br><br>Just a thought. I expect a LOT of work has gone into this, and thats work that others do not need to do again - for what seems a very reasonable price.<br><br>Also, I presume Blitz3D is not required to use CSP??
