Painting on a uv-map, after you unwrapped it, can be easier for more accurate stuff or accessing certain areas of a model better. Painting on the model on the other side is very intuitive like sculpting as you access the areas you're seeing. Mind if i say that both ways work perfectly together in Modo... :O) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

They work in conjunction with each other.<br><br>Some points.<br>When you "paint" in a 3d program you are simply painting the texture on the surface of the object, but you still need to have the UV's in place (some 3d paint programs will do this automatically,...see comments below) I like to paint in 3d for organic things, or to block out major details, and then follow up with the details in a more traditional 2d paint.<br><br>UV layout is an art in itself. If you have poorly done UV maps, your texture (however amazing) will be stretched and/or distorted, and you will not be using the texture pixels optimally.<br><br>Say for example you want to paint a character's face. The usual method would be to unwrap the UV map and flatten it out. From there the texture could be painted in Photoshop or in a 3d paint program using those UV coordinates. Another option would be to load the 3d model with no UV coordinates into a 3d paint program. I use ZBrush, so I will refer to that here. If you do not have UV coordinates, ZBrush will create them for you by mapping every individual polygon and saving this into a new UV layout. This works fine as long as you are painting in 3d, but if you need to retouch later in 2d it can be a problem.<br><br>Lets say that I need to retouch the character and add a scar on the right cheek. If I load the texture in photoshop with the traditionally flattened UVs, I can paint the scar right in. The texture that was created automatically poly by poly, however, will look all scrambled and will be difficult to edit. You could still load it back into the 3d program to edit it normally.<br><br>This is why I prefer to have the best of both worlds. Properly unwrap your model, and paint in 2d/3d, whatever works best for the occasion. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Zbrush's mapping methods (ala AUV/GUV) won't let you edit the texture afterwards in a image editing program (or at least, you wouldn't want to try) but the method is much faster.  Also, you can transfer the texture back to colourise your model, make changes, and make another texture, so that's good.<br><br>Tattoo is horrible.  I wouldn't look at it more than once, and only once if you have to.  Save your pennies and go for Modo instead, if Zbrush's workflow isn't your cup of tea. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
