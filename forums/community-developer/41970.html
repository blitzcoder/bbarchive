The system features normal mapping, cubic mapping, and sphere mapping. Texture, vertex, and pixel shaders are possible.  I will also be adding software vertex shaders, for fast effects on low-end cards.<br><br><b>Physics</b><br>The editor will also feature a real-time physics engine. You can create pre-set physical objects, stack them up, and watch them tumble in the editor. Physics objects will be pre-made in a special section of the editor, like how static meshes are set up beforehand. Vehicle physics will be a specially coded case with adjustable parameters.<br><br><b>Engine</b><br>Finally, all of these features will be available in a companion game engine that can be modified with a BASIC script. This is not like programming in DBPro or even like FPSC. All the content creation tools are provided, and a definite production pipeline is established. Additionally, various high-quality media packs will be available to aid in setting up your environments. Some minor script programming will allow you to modify entity behavior or add your own features.<br><br>Too much cool stuff to describe it all right now:<br><img src="http://www.leadwerks.com/post/props4.png"><br><img src="http://www.leadwerks.com/post/matedit05.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.leadwerks.com/post/hull.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.leadwerks.com/post/meshbrowser4.png"><br><img src="http://www.leadwerks.com/post/meshbrowser5.png"><br><img src="http://www.leadwerks.com/post/meshbrowser6.png"><br><img src="http://www.leadwerks.com/post/cs5pimp30.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.leadwerks.com/post/terrain22.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.leadwerks.com/post/terrain31.jpg"> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Comment: This program can help you make your web pages more accessible. An accessible page is one that more individuals can use, such as individuals who are blind or deaf. It can also increase the usefulness of your web page for individuals who browse the web using slower devices like older computers or wireless devices like cell phones and PDAs. An accessible web site makes good business sense (and possibly good legal sense as well). You can enable or disable accessibility checking in the Validator Engine Options.<br><br>123. Comment: You can disable all the error messages for improperly quoted attribute values by having HTML Validator ignore and disregard the quotation mark requirements for attribute values. This option is in CSE HTML Validator's Validator Engine Options. However, it is recommended that you leave these error messages enabled and that you properly enclose attribute values in quotation marks.<br><br>124. Comment: The ampersand '&amp;' is an escape character in HTML. If you want to actually use the ampersand in your HTML document, then the character entity reference '&amp;amp;' should be used instead of the actual ampersand character.<br><br>125. Comment: Possibly misspelled words (5, 2 unique): CShop (2x), Leadwerks (3x). Complete list.<br><br>126. Comment: HTML document detected.<br><br>127. Comment: [111] Tip - Do not use hidden text, small text, comments, popular but unrelated words, etc. to try to 'cheat' to gain better search engine rankings. This is dishonest and some search engines may lower a page's rank for trying to 'cheat'.<br><br>128. Comment: [8] &lt;meta name="description" content="(actual description)"&gt; should be used in the "head" section to provide a brief description of what is contained on this page. This information is used by many search engines when indexing a site. If you are using HTML Validator's integrated editor, then you can add this from the Tags menu and/or from the Tag Inserter.<br><br>129. Comment: [8] &lt;meta name="keywords" content="(actual keyword list)"&gt; should be used in the "head" section to provide a list of keywords that are relevent to this page. This information is used by many search engines when indexing a site. If you are using HTML Validator's integrated editor, then you can add this from the Tags menu and/or from the Tag Inserter.<br><br>130. Comment: An ICRA label (a rating "meta" tag) was not found in the "head" section of this document. Browsers that are enabled with this rating system may not display documents that have not been labelled. If you have labelled this document by rating the section (directory) in which it is found, or if your site is a personal web space on a large Internet Service Provider, it is still recommended that you include the rating "meta" tag on all of your pages for performance reasons. For more information, please visit <a href="http://www.icra.org/." target="_blank">http://www.icra.org/.</a><br><br>131. Comment: Although not normally necessary, you may want to include a "meta" tag similar to the following in the "head" section of your document: &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=us-ascii"&gt;<br><br>132. Comment: [10] CSE HTML Validator Std/Pro allows you to disable certain messages (like this example message) and groups of related messages by disabling flags. For instance, the [10] at the beginning of this message indicates that you can disable this message by disabling validator flag 10. If you are using HTML Validator's integrated editor, then you can simply use your mouse on this message to open the context menu (usually done by right-clicking the mouse on this message) and select 'Disable Flag 10' to disable this message. For more information about disabling messages, please look at the Configuration section in the documentation.<br><br>133. Comment: CSE HTML Validator Std/Pro allows you to disable many messages on an individual basis without using flags. For instance, you can disable this message by using HTML Validator's integrated editor to open the context menu for this message (usually done by right-clicking the mouse on this message) and selecting 'Options for this Message-&gt;Disable Message' to disable this message.
