Getting CS4 "for free" is a pretty good reason to buy in the first place, but the improvements to animation and the normal mapping as well as the improvements to poly modelling and the long-awaited EPoly modifier make this a very desirable update. Plus I never upgraded to 6, so I don't yet have the UV mapping improvements that happened in V6.<br><br>Question though. Has anyone bought this yet? And more importantly, has anyone tested it with Pipeline yet?

My jaws broke the table when so those new features...not cs4 bundled and new mental ray stuff...but...those tuts...woah. Normal mapping finally made easy and not getting out a package...skinwrap, skinmorph, the othe ranimation stuff...not so impressed in mdoelling one.Funnily, yet they have not added all the easiness of Wings/Mirai, and several features are since eons in those, but happily, they're quite clever, and are adding all the aproachs needed. I noticed this flowing direction since 5. Several new comands, the stuff of getting all into a floating menu...etc...I use to set my shotcuts hot leys in every package, but a floating right click menu is just so handy (ie, turn edge mode with an edit mesh object, cut in edit poly, etc...) Yup, adding an edit poly modifier is so useful . Gotta download that trial. Anyway, I hope the enxt company to work for will have Max 7 purchased.<br><br>"Plus I never upgraded to 6"<br><br>There's a particulary pair of interesting features in everyday work in relation to 5: relax uv, but specially, mirror weights in skin modifier, at vertex level.I think it already had enevelopes mirroring, but don't quote me on that as I am not sure if that was only on Physique. Anyway, for some reason I keep prefering Skin. Mirroring weights in max 6 is a real good thing. Weighting work to 50%.<br><br>BTW, IMHO from 5 to 6 there was no way as much difference than from 6 to 7. i see this 7 very revolutionary.<br>And of course, from 5 to 7, u'll notice lots of improves more.<br><br>Keeps being to expensive for me..I'll keep downloading that 7 trial, and will cry a bit...<br><br>Sorry if I don't answer, I'm not checking forums much lately... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
