Much functional.<br><br>For example, in general...(as I have not tested the evrsion of Persistent World yet)  ..I'd say...rightclik in-place floating menus (where u are modelling and have the cursor) and have all comands there, becomes quite functional, and non workflow killer.<br><br>Gmax is great for the splines stuff, lofts and extrussions, if it's just 50% of what is Max.(imho a really good level editor) Boleans in Max 6 seem much better than they were, and become useful for quick level editing, also.<br><br>metasequoia, for a bit of in what Wings excells...inmediate access to all. things like popping up a tiny menu when u hit "w" key, and it cycles which command to use if u continue tapping w. (ie: turning edge, break edge, etc)<br><br>But is if u really want to get into the actual modelling features. <br><br>Snapping..tends to be important....<br><br>numeric operations...in wings, I can start moving in X axe direction, I hit TAB and put an exact number...<br><br>Mirror. Duplicate object. Weld objects(a boolean), or at least , weld vertices. Turn edge. rotate, move, scale. <br><br>Align objects. Align respect a vertex, align in reference of several vertices.<br><br>But the actual option of non adding modelling tools, just... allowing importing well a model in OBJ, X, ASE, or B·D format...does teh task already, people can model in their modeller. <br><br>So would be in a basic-essential set needed only rotate, scale, move, align, snap (to a grid, or/and to another object) ...later on if feel strong, maybe add lights. As adding a lightmapping stuff, done well , would be close to crazy, at least make teh lights and light settings (spot, omniboth of their settings, in a basic way, light color, intensity) so to be able to do an export to: a renderer, or a lightmapper, as kickass and great as Giles.<br><br>Maybe the posibility of, while not adding uv mapping tools(allways trying to avoid stuff that u can do with free tools and is done) yet adding the ability to generate in the file a second UV channel, empty, so that , as the x or whatever model was imported with UVs, the users can copy the channel 1 one into channel 2. or another way would be to some sort of copy UV info to clipboard, and paste in the second UV channel. If load another mesh, to make it work, must be the very exatc same mesh.<br>An export format to have all this info, could be...perhaps ASE, i suppose b3d does no have lights settings support. ASE has it all, but no ASE loader for Blitz3d. In case Blitz3d is one of the destinys. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Therefore I would like to again recommend you take a look at Second Life, which indeed incorporates such a tool directly in it's core. And with great success.<br><br>You need to consider different things from the button layout for such a project, and take careful consideration to how the interaction between users flow. What you are doing is not a tool, but a workshop, and the most important aspect is how the interaction between the users is going to be handled, and not whether or not you have, snap to grid or not, or what files it exports.<br><br>If you do find this to be the most important aspect, then make a single user tool, and skip the multi-user part. This is what you need to focus on first. It's great to think about the other things too, but it is not pivotal before you get the other things in place.<br><br>My humble opinion. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I've been reviewing Second Life. I would like to give it a trial, unfortunately, Its not compatible with Windows98:( <br><br>From a brief and general prospective, it appears to be a MMOG which allows you to create 3D content and data scripts internally. Its very unique and cool indeed.<br><br>The Network aspect of the PW3D is the highlight of the application, and it is my focus. I've worked with other networked applications that manage Access and Ownership of Network assets and I intend to employ similar techniques.<br><br>Unfortunately I cannot experience Second Life with my current PC. I read several online articles that attempt to describe the tools used:<br><div class="quote"> It is a WYSIWYG tool. The building functionality is integrated right into the Second Life UI. There are no separate tools to learn or applications to load. If you want to create a box, you click on the "create" tool and click on the ground in front of you. The box appears in front of you, and can be seen immediately by anyone standing nearby. <br><br>This means you can build in-world in real time, either on your own or collaboratively with others. The building tools and scripting system are easy for beginners to pick up, yet powerful enough for advanced artists and programmers to really flex their creativity - you can easily build objects that look great.<br><br>If you want to take the next step, there is a simple scripting language that can give these objects behaviors or special effects. Scripting is easy enough for non-programmers to pick up quickly so that, for example, they can make things spin, change color, or react when clicked. <br></div>We are shooting for the same goal. If you had the opportunity to play in Second Life, perhaps, you can share your perspective on their tools and implementation.<br><br>Once again, Thanks a Mil Friend. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Preferably, simple advatars without animation. I really dont desire to get into the character customizing thing.<br><br>I really like the color code system. It sounds simple and effective.

I'm also wondering how PW3D is going to deal with different processing speeds of CSG. <br><br>Performing CSG simultaneously may be tough. Perhaps update messages could be queued on the local machine - a Task List of some sort. User open tasklist and activate the updates when its convenient. <br><div class="quote"> Another way would be to send out the CSG product as a mesh, without the possibility to undo. <br></div> A side benefit the Task List Queue could be the ability to undo the change by retrieving the unchange version of the geometry from a user that hasnt updated.
