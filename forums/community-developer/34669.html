Quick question...<br><br>How do you choose the textures in ALE?<br><br>I know the texturing is far better than my terrain shader as you're using tiled textures whereas mine just gets one big textures and stretches it over the whole terrain.<br><br>However, The colouring on that terrain is shockingly bad, it looks totally unconvincing. Are you using algorythms to texture it or is it a manual thing.<br><br>Also the shadowing doesn't appear to cast shadows... is this correct?<br><br>Also where you've got the trees there's no shadow below it, I'm aware that the trees were added afterwards in blitz but is there anyway to say, "I've got a tree at x,z can I have a blob shadow here please?" within ale or to affect and ale terrain.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, Ale looks like a fantastic app. Just got a few questions. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

My bad :) Follow the guys nose to the first tree you meet and you can see the shadow. Masked textures are taken into account, so you get shadows in the correct shape.<br><br>The trees were *not* added afterwards. That's one of the new features in the update - adding 'props' to the landscape (note the lighthouse too). All the trees were added using a special function that takes about 5 clicks :) You also have full control over each individual 'prop'.<br><br>You choose textures in ALE by clicking the 'Replace' button next to the appropriate texture in the toolbar. You can also choose the color 'tint' you want by clicking the color box next to the Replace button. And the slider below each texture sets the UV scale.<br><br>The terrain is all 'painted' by hand in realtime (that's what ALE is all about). You can import/export heightmaps if you want to though. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Say all your trees had the word "tree" in their name ("tree01", "palmtree", "dead tree") - you just type "tree" into the appropraite textbox and it seeks and destroys them all. Sound good?<br>BTW, the default.ale file needs to be different because standard ones store the absolute path to textures/meshes on the users machine. The default one needs to work on ANY PC, so just stores the filename.<br>Exported meshes obviously use the stripped filename as well, because they need to work on multiple machines (ie. the gamers PC). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This auto-calculates the altitude for that prop (taking scale into account!) so that the prop sits directly on the landscape ie. not hovering or buried.<br><br>Hope that helps.<br><br>By 'push' a prop into the landscape, I assume you mean deforming the mesh so that it follows the same contours of the ground (as opposed to actually 'burying' a prop). I'm trying to decide the best way to do this so that it works for everybody, but you *can* do it right now.<br>Assuming your racetrack is built in the same way as a terrain (ie. a tri can never point 'down'), all you need to do is export a heightmap, then apply it to the racetrack mesh as some sort of height deformer in whatever modeller you are using. <br>:) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The prop in question is almost as large as the terrain, so hand editing is very time consuming.<br><br>like this:<br>Cast a ray vertical up and down from each terrain vert to test intersect with the prop, if intersect mark that vert, and all 8 adjacent verts as being under the prop. Set all these verts to altitude of prop. (optional: if the prop has sections with varying altitude, handle the offset from base altitude of the prop to the altitude of the actual intersection and bring the terrain right up under the raised portion of the prop)<br><br>Scan all terrain verts, if they are within 1/2 brush of a vert under the prop, figure the distance to the nearest covered vert and set altitude according to (average of brush edge verts not under the prop) averaged with prop altitude (or something like that to make a slope up/down that converges with the terrain outside the brush, you may have some better ideas how to make that happen)<br><br>I could probably do it in the modeling software, but I'm spending way to much time in the modeler, instead of in the editor writing code :) It's gotten to the point where I know more about high end 3D modeling software than my artists do, but I still suck at the creative stuff -- they work in Poser, not 3DS/Maya/Truespace :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
