If someone was to develope an importer<br>for CShop to allow the import of .B3D files into CShop,<br>Would it be worth it to you to purchase it? I mean an importer that actually <b>WORKS!!!!</b> <b>Not the PrefabMaker for CShop that only coverts the mesh only without the texture UV's!!!</b> If someone was to develope a plug-in to allow the proper import of .B3D model files, Would you purchase it? I know I sure would!!!<br>However though! I got someone im' talking to right now that has the talent &amp; skill to do just that! But Im' trying to see if others feel like me regarding this situation here? If enough people post to this and show that they would be interested in just such an importer for CShop... This plug-in just might get created for us all! So what do you all think about this? We really need this badly though!

That's real inspiring to anyone that might of been thinking about developing a plug-in for CShop and would want to maybe make a little money off of it since it's obvious that halo doesn't have any intensions of creating a importer for CShop I guess?!? If this thread ends up getting negitive feed back like this... I guess john probably wont be to interested in wanting to make a plug-in for CShop then... he was going to visit this forum to see just how many people would of been interested in this... but I havn't seen no other post except your's, So I guess John wont be to motivated to want to do this then! Oh well... At least I tried to get this done somehow! But I guess most of the people on these forums here doesn't really care if an importer for .B3D model imports for CShop ever gets created or not?! At least I tried though! :)<br><br>P.S. It is possible to make a plug-in .dll to allow the import of <b>.B3D</b> files.. How do I know? I asked halo this before, And he said that CShop is capable of having such an importer because he made it so with CShop4.1...<br>He said that someone has to write it though! That's why im' trying to get some people interested enough to get someone to do this for CShop! It can be done!! :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Blitz is written in VC++ do you go to the MS site to seek help for Blitz?  No you go to the Blitz site.  CShop may be written in B+, but it is sold by DB.  The official support forums are at the DB site.  If you want a new feature, that is where you should post the feature request.  Blitz has no control over what features are implemented into DB products and I have never seen DB jumping on the Blitz forums to provide tech support.  If you want to see new features in a DB product, you need to post it on the DB forums where they can actually see it and perhaps take action on the suggestions. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

DBS/TGC (or whatever name they are using this week) do not use the Blitz forums for support, never have, never will.
