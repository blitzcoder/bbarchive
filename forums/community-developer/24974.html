Qoole were discontinued and the source code to the program were made available to the public on Qoole's Source Repository: <a href="http://www.volved.com/qsr" target="_blank">http://www.volved.com/qsr</a><br><br>You can get Qoole 2.5 there, which is exactly like WED. Here's a pic of Qoole 2.5 in action:<br><br><img src="http://www.galeon.com/jedive/gallery/qoole.jpg"><br><br>According to what the webpage says, Qoole "is now available free to the public. The Source Code held herein is not undergoing further updates or improvements. It is provided so that you may play, tinker, improve, and even create your own applications, using Qoole v0.99 as a base". And, according to the license file included with the package, "you may use the SOFTWARE for commercial use, granted that the SOFTWARE (created by LITHIUM) is given proper recognition as one of the design tools in the creation of the product or service for commercial use".<br><br>Qoole 2.5 is just 1.7 mb, but you can download a CD-ROM zipped version (220 mb). You unzip the file, burn the contents on a CD-ROM, and you have a great version of the program with autorun! :) Very cool.<br><br>Ok, my program BSP Factory will be published very soon by Binary People. With BSP Factory, you can import the BSP file generated by Qoole, and export it as a B3D file, ready to load in Blitz, and with all the entity information in it.<br><br>You must use Qoole in Quake1 mode in order to import the BSPs into BSP Factory. Ok, you may say, "Quake1 maps are crap". You're probably right, but the geometry information stored in a Quake BSP is EXACTLY the same as the information stored in a Half-Life BSP. The main difference is that Quake  uses grayscale lightmaps, while Half-Life uses full color lightmaps, and that all the textures in a Quake WAD use the same 8bit palette, while Half-Life WADs have one palette for each texture.<br><br>Both problems are avoided by BSP Factory. BSP Factory generate its own lightmaps using the lights positioned in the BSP, and the textures are loaded from JPG files, so you can create a crappy quality Quake1 WAD (using Wally) just to make your map in Qoole, and then use the high-quality JPG textures to import the map in BSP Factory. So a Quake1 BSP and a Half-Life BSP will look exactly the same ^_^<br><br>BSP Factory will be available very soon for only $14.99 <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

For those of you who already have one of them, BSP Factory is not of much interest. For the rest, I have simply made a tool which would suit their needs and which has a very low price. CShop costs 65$, and Unwrap3D+LightBulb cost 68$ (and you also need a modelling package). There are people (like me) who can't afford those great tools, and BSP Factory will probably be an alternative. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I mean, I use Lightbulb (good tool too!) but then I'm not converting BSP maps.  A BSP map already has lightmaps.  As I understand it BSP Factory will not carry over the lightmaps and must generate new ones, but I think Ultimate Unwrap will carry over lightmaps.<br><br>Also, why do you need a modeling package?  As pointed out in your original post, there are free tools like Qoole for creating BSP maps.<br><br>Assuming my understanding of things is correct than the Ultimate Unwrap way is $35 (still more than your tool of course.) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I don't know if you can do that in Unwrap3D. I'm sure that Unwrap3D is a great tool, but it is impossible to make an application that fit the needs of every programmer. I'm sure that there are a lot of happy Unwrap3D customers. I'm sure there will be some people too that will find more suitable to pay 15$ for BSP Factory. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
