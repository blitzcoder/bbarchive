But XSI is making in roads. Lionhead have just switched there main production pipeline to it, (along with all there engine tools), from maya, and its the most populer software in japan both in movies and games (with capcom and I beleave konami noticably using it). Oh and of course half life was made using it, and blur have switched from max to it for there stuff. and ubisoft...etc etc<br><br>The best thing is that the devs are based in montreal, which is really becoming the hotbed of american style games. <a href="http://www.montrealmirror.com/2005/102705/news2.html" target="_blank">http://www.montrealmirror.com/2005/102705/news2.html</a><br><br>So its definatly getting there, but it still has a while before it is really well known for its game stuff. But you should have alook into it, its got some pretty cool game tools; zbrush importer, normal map generation, realtime shaders in the viewport, ability to load your game into an xsi viewport and edit it live. Plus its well priced for indies.<br><br>More detials about specific game features : <a href="http://www.softimage.com/Products/Xsi/v5/industry_solutions/games/" target="_blank">http://www.softimage.com/Products/Xsi/v5/industry_solutions/games/</a><br><br>Some cool videos from valve and other companies using it : <a href="http://www.softimage.com/Community/Xsi/Video_Gallery/default_flash.asp" target="_blank">http://www.softimage.com/Community/Xsi/Video_Gallery/default_flash.asp</a><br><br>But I agree with One Eyed Jack, that max is much better atm for blitz, mainly due to the pipeline. But I wonder how many people actually have a legal licence (since gmax can't really be used). Really max should take out everything fancy and make a cut down 'indie gamers' version, that would be cool. Prahaps they will do that whilst winding down the product as they develop there new maya/max hybrid.<br><br>Anyway, I am happy with my XSI <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I think a big possibility is stuff will continue similar to users in the matter that maya and max will simply continue, perhaps sharing some technology.<br>Or even just as they did, but doing that weird thing of "hot linking", to connect stuff in a more internal way than simple export plugins...that, if well done, could only benefit final users of both.

More strenght, when both products are under same company? Is that really possible??  Who knows. <br><br>With the info that pops out of usual forums (at cgtalk spoke even a guy supposed to work as engineer at Alias, and I don't see in his post that he actually knows what will happen)  , google, business places, I haven't been able to find a better guess... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
