While it is a good piece of software the writer of it does not deserver your money, and I'll tell you why.<br><br>I felt there were some issues with mouse control that needed changing to make using it more natural so I made them in the suggestions forum. RB replies to tell me he thinks his way is more consistent and didn't feel my points were that important. A discussion ensued, no swearing or personal attacks, with RB still disagreeing no matter how I demonstrated the problems. I then decided to set up a poll to see if anyone else felt as I did, which ended with RB deleting the poll and the entire discussion as he wasn't interested in negative feedback.<br><br>Whilst I can't get my money back I can do my duty in pointing out the way I was treated and warning others. We can boycott companies who do not respect their customers and hit them where it hurts, their pockets.<br><br>I would also suggest to Mark that he remove the demo of 3D Canvas from future Blitz3D CDs and cease to support people who treat their customers like this. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

He also does not then go on to continue to abuse you on your personal e-mail, this guy Richard is a real jerk.<br><br>Halo, it wasn't about that he wouldn't change what he was doing, it was that I could demonstrate to him that the way he was doing it was wrong and could be done better. His method of control over the object relied on the way the view was orientated, he saw the mouse pad as not only analogous to the XZ plane but that up/down was Z left/right was X - which works fine until you rotate around your model and then everything gets reversed on screen. I have had the software for over a year, but as I got more experienced I began to find its limitations and made the developer aware of them, he was not prepared to listen and didn't give any real reason why. He then went on to attack my contribution to the community as being negative, self-serving and worthless (all words used by Richard in his e-mails to me).<br><br>Does anyone know where Amabilis is based?
