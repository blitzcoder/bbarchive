The big new thing is the beginning of a flexible plugin system that (over the next few updates) will allow you to write export, import, model creation, and modifier plugins that integrate seamlessly with gile[s].<br><br>For starters only the exporting plugin system is available, to make sure I got all the bits right!<br><br>Here is what's new in this version:<br>- Exporting plugin system<br>- Improved .x importer<br>- Improved support for 3ds importing<br>- Elusive rotation bug corrected<br><br>The installation includes an example exporter with full PureBasic source code, and a reference document that should explain how to write your own plugins. Both are located in the SDK folder!<br><br>If you have no clue what I'm on about, take a look here:<br><a href="http://www.frecle.net/giles" target="_blank">gile[s] - global illumination editor</a><br><a href="/toolbox/toolbox.php?tool=41" target="_blank">Toolbox entry</a><br><br>Have fun! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Rather than storing vertices and triangles directly, a CSG level editing tool is keeping track of solid blocks (often referred to as "brushes") which are pieced together to build the level.  In a sense (ie. I'm REALLY simplifying) CSG file formats are rembering the steps to get to the final mesh, while b3d is the final mesh.  Exporting to b3d is no big deal, but I'm curious about Quill3D importing b3d.  I can't test it first hand so I can't be sure, but I imagine imported b3d models are treated differently than CSG geometry created within Quill. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Well... If someone makes a product and says you can use <b>.X, .B3D, .3ds</b> in their product in this case.. CShop!! Then the customer is going to expect just that! And if the product can't do what the creator claims it can and all... Then i think the customer, Or CShop customers have a perfect right to complain here then! I build &amp; repair PC's on the side for extra income. If I build a product and tell a potential customer that it can do this &amp; that and it don't!!! Then that customer has a perfect right to complain to me about the product! Plus anyways... This really isn't nothing new either!! Anywhere you go, No matter where it might be and all... You will find these same exact expectations from anybody!!! What would you do if you bought Fredborg's product and it didn't live up to what he claims it would do? You would be just as upset about it as well, Exspecially knowen that you laid down a hefty $50.00 for his product!!! Anybody would be like this joe!!! However though... Fredborg's product not only lives up to it's name, But he delivers excellect service too! That in itself will only cause the product to become even more popular than it already is! And as a special note to the <b>Whining</b> part here... If you go over to the Gamecreators website in the CShop forum, You will find alot of other people that where whining too! Not just me! Plus there were alot on the Blitz forums as well!<br>so don't put all of this off on me alone! Im' just persistant. That's All!!!<br><br>And plus anyways! Why did josh say on his forum that it's possibly then to import .b3d into Cshop? He said that's why he written CShop to allow others to write plug-ins into CShop for just such a purpose as this!

But Im' not that great at developing plugins, Or I would of done it already!<br>Believe me guys, If I could write plugins for CShop, I would of done so already! Plus you can be a HardCode Blitzer without writing plugins for another application!<br>I'll be the first one to admit that im' not as experienced as most of you guys on here! That's why Im' always willing to listen &amp; learn from someone that knows more than I do! ;)<br>But the good thing is... I do learn! And I will advance too! ;) Everything always comes in the natural course of time!<br><br>P.S. Almost forgot to mention this too!
