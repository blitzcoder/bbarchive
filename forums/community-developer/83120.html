The key phrase is "or in other Games". In this case my understanding is that you are not limited to any specific software you can include these models in. You should always check. I can't say this applies to all.

The term Game expressly excludes: (a) any software tool or software product which can (or might) be used in order to create further games or other software products; and (b) any software library, compilation or collection of graphics and / or sounds and / or other assets or works from which a particular graphic or sound or other asset or work may be extracted to be used independently of the software in which it was first incorporated; in each case irrespective of whether or not the primary purpose of such software is to entertain its user.<br><br> <br></div><br><br>So does that mean I could use it in a commercial release only when the game was made with one of their products, like FPSCreator, otherwise it may not be commercial? And furthermore is it "commercial" only because there are more than 100 copies??<br><br>This is really confusing...<br><br>Is there anybody who can give me an address so I can ask them directly? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

While the License text posted by Zenman suggests that they make a diffrence between commercial and not commercial use, one may say a  buyer cannot read the License as long as he doesn't buy the product, BUT after reading the text you quoted, he will understand this easily as a permission to use the content commercially (since there ain't no limitations with FPSCreator) in any other (game) application too.<br><br>Maybe this won't give the buyer the right to use the content as desired, but probably he can get his money back. Not what I wanted :) Seems like I really have to contact one of these guys.<br><br>Thanks for the mail addresses.
