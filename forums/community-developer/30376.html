No nurbs, no metaballs, maybe sub-D (I don't know). It includes a bunch of plug-ins for game specific stuff, etc. And, it's cheaper.<br><br>If you like the tS/gS system though the choice is easy depending on what you want. Buy tS and the game pack and you'll get a much more advanced modeler and renderer with a lot of the same game-related goodies. If you just want something for modeling and animating game stuff then get gS - and maybe the new level exporter as well.<br><br>I've used trueSpace since v1.1 though, I must admit, I've become a bit lost since v4 - the last version I actually purchased. I had v5 and have v6.x as product review copies but haven't used them a great deal. I have gS 1.5 and the new level editor as well, and haven't done much more than test them. <br><br>I've always liked tS - I've just got to get into the newer products and get used to working with them. Roman's a friend of mine and he's a bit of a visionary, always pushing the edge - sometimes too far for me :) I never have gotten into all of these 3D widgets and such in tS.<br>M <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The product was a bit rushed - though 1.5 sorts some of this. I think you're a little tough on tS though, and I can see why from what you tell of your experience, because it's a pretty stable, powerful package for the money.<br><br>All companies, discreet and Alias and NewTek included, have gone to a faster development cycle and they've released their share of bugs. Frankly I think it's less excusable for those guys because they have bigger dev teams and bigger budgets.<br><br>That said, I wish they'd all take their time and send products out the door when they're gold, not silver.<br>M <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

They all have their bugs and they all still chew on them. TS is a great package, a little week in animation without extra tools but modeling wise and renderwise it beats the most for much less money. But at the end it's the user and his/her talent. These apps are only tools. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
