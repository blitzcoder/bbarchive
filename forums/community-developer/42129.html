Maya Complete? I suppose you have looked at those deeply... :)<br><br>I must say that at the end, while the only thing I know a bit deeper is Character Studio (which has some big advantages, and some big problems) , I think at the very end I prefer bones. Some in the Mirai(with that IK) style would be ideal. XSI seems to have a great workflow in that, even in Foundation cheap version. And ur getting a good poly modelling, uv mapping, gi renderings and can do lightmaps and normal maps with it...But yep, better have an screen with 1280x1024 and not th etypical 60hz, but at least 85Hz, or it come spretty unusable...or work with hotkeys or custom layout, like some of us do...<br><br>Some guy working in an anim company told me CAT is gonna replace soon Character STudio if continues so.

Not only does it have rigging &amp; animating tools that rock, but it's modeling tools are looking better than what LW has (and that's something). Our coders liked a lot dotxsi export ( for engine pipeline/integration) and the SDL docs were REALLY comprehensive. XSI is a good choice because it has EVERYTHING in one package; good modeler, good animation tools, normal map baker and top-notch renderer although we don't use that much.<br><br>Motion builder (too limited) and Maya (more expensive than XSI, and animation only) were looked at too of course, as well as MAX + CAT (too expensive). Cinema4D was dropped from the start and we didn't look at it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Great to see companies and professional are all getting to a similar conclussion about XSI. :)<br><br>Indeed, I just read in the Fundamentals book (sometimes you are fed up of computers and is nice to read a book ;)..the book though comes really short, is not of much use, if used as only doc. ) and got the surprise (now I am not sure if I read it somhwere else) of a sentence saying something like "a featured that was important for all the Game team".  They have a game team...lol. They seem to have a section in the company dedicated to the game engines stuff. It is said that dotXSI is really good to port stuff to engines...also something about an sdk for all that, too.<br><br>yes, the uv mapping is great , too. The green matching colors of Max for knowing what stitchs with what in real 3d, (while in uv editor) is also there, every feature I know well and used in my main workflows with Max or others, is already there(even lightmaps)...only...really well thought. The thing is...it's a creature in its own, and must be learnt every bit. I watched the other day the photons/gi rendering movie, and is greatly explained. You end up knowing general 3d stuff with it, if you did not touch that area (rendering) too much...The control you have about stuff is like at a lower level, you control a lot of stuff, and the quick region renderer helps a lot. <br><br>I really suffered watching the movie that shows the so natural level of customization of animation and behavior for the XSI hair, told to be one of the best, if not the best, of the market....(as Foundation, or the middle one, do not have hair...only the 6k one.My only real miss...and just as would play with it, not for games ;) )<br><br>I haven't had a deep look at modelling tools, but if you like them, coming from Lightwave, must be really good :)<br><br>What I can only say is...the free animated x exporter(have not tested the importer) worked really nice later on opening in x viewers and Ultimate Unwrap conversion to b3d. The pin bone helper, triggered by hotkey, really a nice thing. For the rest, in Foundation, it offers an skeleton system similar to those already in Max, etc, though very friendly.(typical bone IK chains, etc) And that only looking at it quickly in the surface... It has a load of extremely well thought features and great details.<br><br>Great to hear more people that sees it as a very good way to go :)<br><br>Just that: have a very good 17-19" monitor. ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Basically, the transistors in the LCD remain open or closed as needed until the image changes. This can be a point of confusion for some consumers, however, since most graphics cards still "ask for" a refresh rate setting. This is due to the analog nature of existing graphic cards (see "Inputs" section) and their support for CRT displays. While refresh rates do not apply to LCD monitors, most LCDs are set up to accept any settings from 60Hz and above. <br> <br></div><br><br><a href="http://www.necmitsubishi.com/support/css/monitortechguide/index04.htm" target="_blank">http://www.necmitsubishi.com/support/css/monitortechguide/index04.htm</a><br><br>It may be something else than 60Hz but it does not mean automatically that it is better... LCDs work differently than CRTs. What you SHOULD watch is "response time" and lower RT is better here. High RT (something like 20ms) produce visible ghosting that's REALLY annoying when you play games - or just use windows. Go for 16 or even 12ms if you can. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
