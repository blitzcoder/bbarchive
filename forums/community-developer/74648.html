The GUI sucks and it is extremely ugly.<br><br>I found the following quote that pretty much sums up my thoughts on Blender (and why it will never achieve its potential):<br><br><div class="quote"> Blender is an open-source, free, 3D modeling/animation/rendering package available for download from <a href="http://www.blender.org/." target="_blank">http://www.blender.org/.</a> The good news is that it works very well, even on less-powerful machines. The bad news is that if you've ever done a project in some commercial environment like Maya or 3Ds Max®, the GUI is going to be utterly alien to you. It's not that there's anything wrong with Blender's interface, it's just that it's...different. Different from just about everything else. Way different.<br><br>In fact, many people now using Maya who would like to migrate to Blender are deterred from doing so (I heard their complaints myself, at SIGGRAPH) by the necessity of learning a software interface that's so utterly unlike everything they've trained themselves for years to handle. My own feeling is that this "do your own thing" approach is hurting widespread acceptance of Blender in the worldwide animation and modeling community.<br><br>And certainly, the GUI has been improved to the extent of providing click-buttons for many functions that once required a fistful of keystroke combinations. And the coming release of Blender V2.5 is said to have a much more user-configurable GUI, one that users will be able to reassemble into something more comfortable to them. But persuading the Blender programmers to make even these concessions hasn't been easy. In the frosty words of Ton Roosendaal, the lead developer of Blender, "Blender isn't for Maya users — Blender is for Blender users." So much for reaching out to the masses. <br></div><br>Taken from: <a href="http://css.its.psu.edu/news/tollfree.html" target="_blank">http://css.its.psu.edu/news/tollfree.html</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Interesting that Maya users (Maya costs 1800 UK Pounds upwards) would want to move to Blender. *Rhetorical question* Why would they even consider it? Because of it's immense power, that's why. No one piece of commercial software can match Blender feature for feature.<br><br>@Everyone<br><br>Blender's aim (with respect to professional users) is not to supplant all the commercial software used in commercial studios but to slot in alongside as part of a professionals pipeline. The user event system is currently being recoded from scratch which, when complete, will allow for user customisation to the n'th degree.<br><br><br>As for Ton's (Blender lead developer) "frosty words" (a more approachable chap you'd be hard pressed to find) I can only agree. Why mess about with an application to suit a small minority? Blender downloads last year circa 1.8 million. Blender in a non-commercial environment is, for me, a no brainer. Time will tell on it's continued adoption within the industry.<br><br>That such a powerful program is available to anyone for free is a matter for great celebration.

Blender's current takeup is a drop in the ocean compared with what it could be. This is a problem with open-source software in general, though. Geeky developers want to devote their time to working on obscure features. They consider these things to be technically interesting and/or challenging, and so they ignore the needs of non-hardcore/fanboy users. This is because they don't have any commercial incentives to do appeal to increase their marketshare by working to improve aspects of their software that people really care about.<br><br>Or, as I like to call it:<br><br><i>"I don't have a problem with hundreds of undocumented keyboard shortcuts, and neither do any of my co-developers, or the regulars on our official forums.

I guess..  have worked professionally to some extent with both Max and Truespace before that to visualise prototype devices before they are assembled from working drawings. This usually included a mock 'environment' &amp; animations (eg; showing a mockup of a mall with public info terminals or whatever) to make it look good for customers. <br>(Its not the movies or games, but it is "professional" modelling). I think a better question would be how many people actually own a (their OWN 100% legal) full version of 3D studio Max? Not many truthful ones ill wager.<br><br>Also, the guys behind the animation in spiderman 2 seem to know what they are doing and they were using it for character animation and pre-visuals. Other apps i have tried include AC3D, Some lightwave, Bryce, Wings, Some Maya, hexagon (this is also a quite good one for the price) and a few others not worth mentioning. <br><br>My point is still; No, blender isnt as "good" as the leading industry standard apps costing 1000s namely maya, XSI or Max. It is imo certainly better, as-good-as or nearly-as-good as the rest of them ive used, despite its quirky interface and is certainly a mountain more than enough for building, animating and exporting b3d models. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's come a long way since then, but still has a rubbish GUI, which was its biggest problem a decade ago.
