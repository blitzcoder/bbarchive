There are menus for everything and they are very easy to use and playing for a few minutes gets results you'll enjoy.<br><br>The download is 43 MB so there's a massive media base which comes with this prog too.  The export abilities are incredible too, there's everything in there you would want or need, just look at the list!<br><br>'Export to  X, OBJ, LWO, SMD, ASC(3dmax), TXT(milkshape), DBO(darkbasicPro), B3D, RAW, WRL, TM2'<br><br>Where it falls down for me is that these days I expect to see movement in the branches or leaves.  <br><br>Now I may be wrong but I can't see any movement in there at all, certainly in the preview mode the grass pops up but then it all remains static, no wind or even light breeze.  <br><br>That's a real shame as it's what is needed to make people look at this as a definate purchase.<br><br>[amended by addition]<br><br>A great way to add animation easily to the exported trees would be to export them as TXT(milkshape), bone and animate them inside Milkshape.  This export possibility from Tree Magik Generation 2 provides an excellent opportunity to make all your tree filled environments come to life.<br><br>For me, this is the best product in this range from AlienCodec so far - and apparently there is an upgrade path if you have purchased previous similar products - AND they promise an upgrade path from here up with-in the G2 range.<br><br>I do have an issue with the 'photorealistic textures' - they are photographs maybe, but up close they are generally not so high in detail.  This is fine for low poly - trees in the distance - but when your character wanders around the orchard, you'll be able to see the lack of detail up close, but you can't have everything!<br><br>A lot of work has gone into refining this product, and it really shows, for some it will be just what they have been waiting for - for others it will be a very worthy upgrade.<br><br>IPete2. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You touch a few points of interest. One being the animations. As Im aware of the need for animation it just wasnt suitable for this project. As I would have had to use bone animations for most of the sequences. This would have limited my export ability to just a few; not so good when my goal was to reach a broader audience.  Tmg2 does offer a real time saver for animtations however. The milkshape export loads trees directly into milkshape including the alphas.. It took me about 10 mins to bone and animate a tree. While this dosent justify the lack of animation controls - it does offer an alternative. Im still going to be adding some form of animation export soon however even if it's restricted to X and B3d exporting only. <br><br>As for an upgrade path, you mention there isn't one when in fact there is. The Aliencodec forums provide this information and can be viewed here. http://www.aliencodec.com/cgi-bin/forum/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?s=e6887f1c24eab2f7fdb52f32d27536e2;act=ST;f=1;t=62<br><br>I'm continually upgrading and updating tmg2 - as today i will be releasing a patch which allows multi-language support. Im also very close to finishing an addon plugin that allows designers to place tree roots on the creations.. This is only the begining !<br><br>The reason for the upgrade charge is simple -<br>We first sold Treemagik Classic and allowed users to upgrade to Treemagik Plus for free..<br>From treemagik Plus users where allowed to upgrade to Treemagik Pro for free. Thats alot of free updates! Seeing as Classic used to only cost $20 - people were upgraded with more than $85.00 of free products. I don't have a problem with this and orginally planned to conitnue the free upgrade support. That is until i signed several contracts with resellers and wholesellers - these options no longer became avaiable to me. I had to fight pretty hard just to allow Treemagik Pro users to upgrade for a reduced cost.<br><br>Once again, thanks for the indepth review ! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'm glad there is one - it kinda makes me feel I was a little too harsh now.<br><br>I'm also glad you mentioned the Milkshape path for anims as this is a very sensible way of adding animation to the trees exported - for me this is how I would want to proceed to add them as it is a fast an defficient way forwards.<br><br>I had it in my mind that I had to pay for the upgrade to Tree Magik Pro - not sure why - but I was fairly sure I had paid extra for the upgrade - my genuine mistake - sorry.<br><br>IPete2. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
