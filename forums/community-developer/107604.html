It's the platform that always takes the least time to get hacked. <br><br>"Linux" is also only as secure as the software stack that you run on it. If you run Apache on your precious Linux kernel, or BIND, or an FTP daemon, then don't expect any security miracles anymore.<br><br>So you think booting a Linux Live CD on an existing Windows machine is an "exploit"? Huh? You have PHYSICAL access to the server, boot another OS on it and OVERWRITE existing files and configs? You call this an EXPLOIT? Really, you should look up the definition of security exploits. What do you think a Linux Live CD can do to an existing Linux installation? Or what do you think a macOS USB stick will do to an existing macOS installation once you fire up a shell and use your root privileges?<br><br>Why do "all these thousands of security holes exist"? Because Windows is a compilation of thousands of subsystems, written by imperfect humans in a shitty language called C, that's why. Out of the box, Windows has BY FAR the greatest feature set of all available operating systems -- it beats the crap out of macOS, and it ALSO beats the shit out of any Linux desktop installation. Yes, you can install a myriad of features on Linux, but the key phrase was "OUT OF THE BOX". Windows comes with a load of features pre-installed and pre-configured that most people don't even know exist, but that make the system so flexible, powerful and, yes, even comfortable. But that complexity also opens the door for additional vulnerabilities. <br><br><div class="quote"> <br>Linux is the best bet because there are no egos or commercial pressures.. <br></div><br><br>That's a good one. I bet the developers at Microsoft (who committed more changes to the Linux kernel in recent years than ALL other developers together), Oracle, IBM, Red Hat and Canonical might have an entirely different perspective. "Linux" is an industry worth billions of dollars. Unlike everything people want to believe, "Linux" is NOT being developed by "enthusiasts", volunteers and hobbyists, but by developers hired by corporations following corporate agendas. <br><br>And as for the egos... The lady that developed the orginal USB 3 stack for Linux left the Linux kernel community because she couldn't handle the rude egos of her peers anymore and Linus himself is notorious for his extremely rude posts.<br><br>So let's just drop the romantic glasses. Linux might be Open Source and even "Free" software, but it definitely is also an industrial product like everything else. In most cases, you just don't have to put money on the table for a license in order to start using it. (The TCO for Linux, in my experience, is an entirely different topic and it actually is NOT cheaper to use Linux throughout the lifetime of a project than it is to run Windows.)<br><br><div class="quote"> Ya want a secure OS write Ya own ;)  <br></div><br><br>There is no such thing in a networked world anymore. Even if the OS itself might be relatively secure, the packets that you send over the network are open for anybody to read and manipulate - even if they are encrypted. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I don't have auto update on and here's why.<br><br>After reinstalling Win 7 recently I found it was too slow booting when auto update was on but you need it on until SP1 is installed as the install process won't work with it off. I found you have to install all updates straight away or SP1 will not install properly and auto update stops working (I had to uninstall SP1 then install all other updates before reinstalling SP1). I also found Skype loading on startup was a major resource hog, when testing videos in the browser.<br><br>While I like Windows 7, it is cursed by the horde of malware out there. Even a simple search in Google resulted in some javascript exploit bringing my browser to a halt and forcing me to do a system restore, which is a great tool that saved me reinstalling a few times (so don't listen to the people who tell you to switch it off to improve performance). I don't bother with antivirus as they are all resource hogs (although free Avast would be my choice if I did) and I only visit trusted sites in Windows now.
