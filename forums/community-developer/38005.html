If you can find a decent 3D app for cheap that supports these tools you can go pretty far with level building.<br><br>vertex snap lets you drag geometry around in 3d and have it snap to other geometry depening on what your snap settings are. <br><br>I most often use vertex and mid point snap, with edge extrude for creating walls quickly. Wing's will be far better than maplet though :) as that creates the worst geometry I have seen outside of a poor quality boolean tools. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But you can use the ctrl (control) key in many operations, ie, free vertex moves, and seems it snaps to certain amount. I have never used it, as in wings the workflows are quite different....<br><br>And yep, maybe is not specially ideal for levels. Though, you can do the stuff. Mainly, if you master it, at the end, is so versatil there's allways a path.But often is slower in workflow than a vertex based or spline based modeller, maybe much suited to it.<br><br>Specially, if need walls of extruded edges and not solid walls, then workarounds are needed, like using the hole material (deletes all what is applied with it, in OBJ export)<br><br>I'd advice the most advanced tuts page I know :<br><a href="http://www.geocities.com/paulthepuzzles/aardvarks.html" target="_blank">http://www.geocities.com/paulthepuzzles/aardvarks.html</a><br><br>but even in that page, there's a section called "baby tuts".Go there first.<br><br>BTW, there's allways a requirement of make ur brains work...when I started at 3d , long ago, I also searched for tuts that solved it. I decided to just use my own brain to deduce things, and usually now I rarely use a tut or doc. Most uis will become similar after using many.<br><br>For level designing, and objects point to point modellers there's my other free tool, my other fav one, a japanesse one (actually this is shareware,Evak, Wings totally free, BSD open source, the most free license I know) .Been largely used by japanese cg indies, in Japan, and flight simulator modders...but not much of the general 3d world know it...well. It has grid,  grid configuring, snap to grid (yes! ;) ) , edge extrude (pull), it has shortcuts (fixed, not configurable like wings) , vertex point modeller, you can just go filling your model point to point... you can trace a shape over the wall, and then delete the inside faces, extrude to the interior and delete the bottom faces, etc, etc, etc.<br><br>I even use it sometimes for retouch vertex based stuff of my organic models made in wings. Like a cloth that needs to be single walled...I can do with hole material, but sometimes you prefer the standard way of doing things. <br><br>In both wings and metasequoia you can just load a reference image and trace over the image blueprint your several views. I have done it professionally in a game job, modelled loads of real life objects and quite accurately with wings, but I admit it needs quite a huge knowledge of wings to it in a comfortable way, and still there are limits.<br><br>That's why sometimes I just use Hamapatch (splines modeller that can make peaks (ie: vertex modeller) and export OBJ files) , or Metasequoia if I think i'll go quicker so. And often finally integrate in Wings (but open objects or isolate vertices or deleted faces, inverted ones, mess obj import in wings. That's all related to winged edge internal 3d structure in wings. Winged edge. It need all to be a solid. Anyway, all can be worked out.)<br><br>Metasequoia...I was doing stuff at th every first quarter of an our...same with Wings, but to be true, I was quite experienced in 3d when I arrived at Wings.<br><br>Only thing is license. Some very few ppl(very few users of the tool) say that well, as it is impossible to buy outside of Japan, and that is since long time...and as the shareware mqo files can be opened in Ultimate Unwrap (so much I recommend UU...) seamlessly....They use the shareware (well I have done also) as it's just a bit more advanced, and no legal stuff said about it. It's only said of the LE version which can be only used for non comercial. But I read no word bout the shareware one. The LE provides formats export: x, cob, dxf...enough to do the deal for those not having Ultimate Unwrap.<br><br>The shading is way better and more accurate for modelling than in Wings and Milkshape.  Very good specially in organic. But WIngs has way better virtual mirror for characters than metasequoia, while Meta's magnet is better...and so on. At the end, I use them both, though my latest projects are totally done in wings and mapped in UU.<br><br>Metasequoia is very easy.Remember to set it up as Advanced, as basic mode is very reduced, and you wont have any advantage, just some important commands not shown.<br><br>Using only wings if you're an advanced user, is enough.If you're new  to all this, I'd advice install both, it's few megs both ,and can be loaded at same time (these are not the resource hungry huge packages in comercial levels) and see what you prefer.<br><br>But yep, for levels maybe better Metasequoia. I like it a lot too. If it's been used for accurate airplanes modelling as well as japanese cg and game characters, heh, must be good... ;)<br><br><br>If you have Ultimate Unwrap (strongly adviced) then download shareware 2.33 <br>if not, LE version is the same, only important miss is 4 viewport, but i tend to prefer one view full screen viewport, I work with keys in every package...F1 , F3, F2 , etc, give me main views, v is vertex/face/edge move...b is magnet, etc, etc....as a curious thing, you can handle the light interactively during modelling, in organic this is sweet...sumed to the good (directx, opengl in this is not so good) shading, allows much more accurateness, checked in a ut mod, I could see subtle deficiencies in a human face that were not spoted in Milkshape of the other mates.<br><br>no more chat, I'll put you the links (and I was gonna be brief...XD )<br>Sorry, no tuts links, I learned without them and there's nothing translated to english, not even english help file, status bar messages are in japanese characters (but all menu comands, all the handling is in english don't worry..:) )<br><br>Metasequoia<br><a href="http://www21.ocn.ne.jp/~mizno/main_e.html" target="_blank">http://www21.ocn.ne.jp/~mizno/main_e.html</a><br><br>wings3d:<br>www.wings3d.com<br><br>go to its oficial forums, user manual and interface and usage sections, highly recommended, and mostly the link I did put u at the start of the post:<br><br><a href="http://www.geocities.com/paulthepuzzles/aardvarks.html" target="_blank">http://www.geocities.com/paulthepuzzles/aardvarks.html</a><br><br>You'll see how this wings genious has found a workaorund for every crazy modelling task.<br><br>Oh, one of the workarounds for level stuff is import ai paths, and extrude, etc.<br><br>BTW, I'd advice fo rlevels have a quite and deep glance at metasequoia.<br><br>If I were rich or have an stable job (that's my concept of being rich) I'd mount a HUGE site of tutorials for dozens of tools I have got till the latest depth.

A lot of depth. The 50% of people that aproach to it never reach to know it. Imo there's needed a bit of time of patience. Not even an small portion of the needed with Blender. ANyway, Blender also animates, render, and now export to x v8...so, quite good for the very patient or 3d experienced. I don't recommend it though for other than experienced ppl or the ones wanting to dedicate a very important portion of your time to learn it.<br><br>Ther you go, quite a load of info.

This way you flip all. If u had made a very complex "spline" shape, you will have your room just as you wanted.<br><br>As you see, is a matter more of knowing very deeply wings. While in tools like Max, this is done in a more direct and intuitive way.<br><br>Gmax supposedly has this too. And now is cleared you can use it provided you don't use ilegal work arounds to export, and that the game pak or maxcript used for it , is legal for comercial uses, and does not "reverse engineer".<br><br>Indeed, gmax for level may be is a clever way. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In EDIT (this is a nother one)rolling menu, you have a possibility of save a selection to restore later...u can have there up to 4 selections. Quite handy, of course, here comes no where close the groups (saved selections) of wings, that allow much more power.<br><br>I said it before, I repeat now: I use both. I can do a full project (indee,done many times) with only one of them, is just a matter of using the ideal tool at each stage.<br><br>What more...oh, yes. If ur gonna use pull..beware.<br><br>A extrude/normal, will act the way u want from buildings from a plant  blueprint. You can select interior walls, extrude normal into the inside(to make the walls thickness in case is needed (usually not)), but remember you can invert faces normals in case you need.<br><br>In meta, I'd extrude a blueprint trace plane (done with CREATE FACE tool (f)from a top view (F2, bottom shift+F2)) with "normal" button pressed in extrude options.<br><br>Then I'd invert normals of whole model (menu "selected")<br><br>so walls point to the inside.<br><br>usually this is fastest.<br><br>Wings has more weapons, but for levels has other problems.<br><br>In wings, I'd for example add a cube, delete all faces except top one.(quad select from front view (z))<br><br>that face left, I'd select it, hit (L) , , the (0) (that's 10 cuts in each edge)<br><br>And now, for example, you could go tracing over your image plane object (loaded previuosly ) if u need it. With move free (in my case, N key, put your own) , in ortographic view activated, and top view (Y), you could go tracing (moving vertices) and advice: ctrl pressed while dragging, constrains the movement in "jumps"~grid snap. WIth shift, it will, I think snap to existing vertices.<br><br>Is very, very usful the use of flatten, secondary mode, choose reference vertex, edge, etc. So you align vertices, if needed.<br><br>Also, tab, for enetring an exact number.<br><br>also shift D (repeat last command, same amount)<br><br>also, know that you can mirror stuff and weld. Or use virtual mirror. An that scaling vertices in an axe makes the  behave with simetry to the center, very useful.<br><br>Puzzled Paul explains this all much better.<br><br>There are many many ways.<br><br>BTW, sorry. In meta, pull wont work well for you. It does not react to grid snap. Neither extrude normal. But at least withextrude you can quad or lasso select the roof of an extruded house floor, and move with snap to grid, or align vertex to an exact height position. This is often easier done in wings. <br><br>The fact is meta---&gt;wings is full of problems, while wings---&gt; meta doesn't.<br><br>Was curious , so banged now a quick level with blender...very good tools...can be done...but...compared to meta and wings,I'd prefer the others for ease of use, and wings is quicker in what it can do.<br><br>Also made in meta and in wings...Well, maybe wings is the fastest...<br><br>I'd have to test a bit gmax for a more complete "review", but i'd expect it to be the ideal. <br><br>All needs solid knowledge of the package ;)<br><br>Intrude in wings...can add some more extra polies, and has some dangers, but yep, is a good way too.<br><br>I tend to prefer an inset, extrude normal to the inside, maybe some flattens to vertex to align.<br><br>the rubbish wings "level" I banged in some minutes. Is just to say it's possible<br><br><img src="http://picserver.org/view_image.php/ROW5I1GSN3Q9/picserver.jpeg"><br><img src="http://picserver.org/view_image.php/E0NH6V5Y3OXM/picserver.jpeg"> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
