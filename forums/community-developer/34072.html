It is restricted somewhat (650 polys for objects, 5k polys for levels) but there is no time limit and you can save in .X format so it is actually useable for learning, prototyping, etc.<br><br>If you're interested check out the pages at:<br><a href="http://www.caligari.com/gamespace/" target="_blank">http://www.caligari.com/gamespace/</a><br><br>Also, we just announced a contest with some great prizes (&gt;$10k!!). Categories are character modeling and animation, vehicle modeling and animation, and interactive demo creation. Hopefully something for everyone! I managed to score six Radeon X800 and three Radeon 9800 Pro cards from our partner ATI (those guys are so cool) to use as prizes so you want to at least check it out. I wish I could enter :)<br><br>The contest pages are linked from the main gamespace page (link above) - just click on the orangish banner in the right column. <br><br>Hope you guys don't mind the pimpage.<br>Cheers,<br>M <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I've been using Blitz for about two years. I was started working for Caligari about a month and a half ago - though I've known Roman for a number of years. gameSpace was introduced last September.<br><br>DarkMATTER doesn't come with gameSpace. We offer it for sale on our site and, in return, we allow TGC to sell gameSpace and related products on their site.<br><br>The site says "Libraries of models for fast content, and access thousands of publicly available models". In truth this statement needs to be reworked a bit. There are, in fact, libraries of models distributed with gameSpace but the number of models is between 50-100 and a lot of them probably aren't very useable for games (though I suppose that depends on what kind of game you're doing). Some of the included models are quite good however.<br><br>[edit]Oh, to my knowledge there's no list of included models available - I'll check into maybe providing it on the site, though the current model libraries shouldn't factor into the purchase decision too much. This is one of the reasons the statement above should probably be worked on a bit.[/edit]<br><br>We are, however, working on converting 500 low and medium resolution models (from Digimation) to COB format and these will be made available (probably in blocks of models over time) to gameSpace customers when the conversion is done. We have also commissioned several pro-quality animated characters to be given to gS owners. I think maybe three of these are nearing completion. No firm date on the availability of these - and I haven't seen them myself - but I do know that both projects are pretty far along.<br><br>Hope that answers everyone :)<br>M <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I would say it's quite interesting; anyway, I was a bit scared by the unusual user interface, whith lots of icons and hidden icons, and without a simple description on what does what. There's an icon helper and it does help a bit, but is way far from being 'user friendly' IMO.<br><br>1) About tutorials, there are only 2 movies and one tutorial on the main web site; I expect much more for a 299$ product.<br><br>2) the UNDO function does not undo everything; if you happen to delete a face and you didn't saved your work previously, you're lost.<br><br>3) the help file consists in a huge document which contains NO images ! I mean, when you want to know which icon to press to obtain the 'delete surface' mode, why in the hell don't put just a simple image in the help file with the related description ! Is that so hard to do ? This is really annoying.<br><br>In my opinion, with a proper set of tutorials, a whole remake of the help file, and a much better user interface, it would be much more interesting.<br><br>Again, my 0.1 eurocent.<br><br>Sergio. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

VERY aware of the help file issues :) We have a 60MB plus set of PDFs which are essentially the printed manual in electronic format and the CHM - which for some reason is missing images (making it nearly unuseable). I raised this issue in a meeting yesterday and have asked our documentation person to look into getting images into the CHM. I suspect this was done to limit file size - but without the images it isn't much good for new users.<br><br>We are aware of the UNDO function. It works to spec - but the spec was established when tS1.0 was created (like when Windows 3.1 was still the big thing). At the time undo wasn't exactly a standard feature as now so it works a little differently. Each object has its own stack so, when you switch contexts, you can't go back and undo what you had done previously. <br><br>It's a design issue but, from the POV of most users, it is broken. We can't unfortunately fix it in existing products because it is woven so tightly into the core. We are, however, creating a global undo stack in our next generation of products - which have been rewritten from the ground up. Undo works but you just have to be careful.<br><br>On tutorials, we certainly want to and plan to introduce more. Did you look at the 3D buzz videos though? There's like an hour and a half of video there.<br><br>The UI is certainly bizarre (though perhaps not as alien as Blender :) ) to new users. Work with it for a bit (with a proper manual, I might add) and it becomes very intuitive however. Then again, I've been a tS user since v1.1 so I've always been a fan of how it works. FYI, our new UIs will be displayable as icons or text - very smooth.<br><br>Thanks for the feedback Semar!<br>M <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
