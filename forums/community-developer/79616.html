I have been using Paint shop pro since the Dos/Windows 3.1 days for drawings, and other 'arty-farty' stuff.<br><br>I recently went on holiday and my laptop had no PSP or wine installed on it, so i downloaded the latest gimp. I have been using this too for a while but only for certain filter and transparency operations. I grudgingly started using it for some complicated drawing stuff and was soon swearing at the interface. <br><br>Rather than giving up with it like i usually do, I decided to investigate exactly how this horrid program was supposed to work. Not being a "mac-photoshop" (the multiple windows) or a "win-photoshop" (odd shortcuts) type person everything was making me crazy. Tools kept dissapearing behind images and other infuriating problems.<br><br>Anyway. I found out it can be quite comfortable to use with a few options changes and it is more way more powerful than i first thought, its all there, its just in strange places:<br><br>-It does have editable text layers after all. <br>-the path tool is very usable and much better than i thought. (especially when the paths and layer dialogues are docked in the tabber)<br>-my old moan about LMB for 1 color and RMB for another is easily fixed by pressing X. (I guess this is a PShop thing)<br>-The dissapearing tools can be assigned to the little-used "menu key" between ctrl+alt under prefs -&gt; key shortcuts -&gt; dialogs -&gt; tools<br>-Once all the dialogue boxes are docked under the tools (as tabs), they too can be accessed by menu key.<br>-The way the layers once you know how, work better than in PSP.<br>-Response from my tablet works better.<br>-It has some good filters too (so does PSP but i cant remember there being this many in gimp).<br>-It FINALLY has a proper brush scale slider<br>-The clone tool does have a 'parallel' mode after all.<br><br>A week ago if you had said choose Gimp over PSP i would have said "Not on your nelly!". While i guess its no photoshop (but i have never needed or liked that anyway) it is certainly superior to what i have been using all this time and is perfect for the arty stuff.<br><br>If you do not have photoshop and have not tried gimp for a while i strongly reccomend looking at it again. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Ubuntu has free open source "nv" drivers that tend to work well with older hardware (like geforce 4 for example). The GF XXXX cards tend to need the proprietry ones if you want to benefit from proper 2d and 3d acceleration. Otherwise the system simply defaults to vesa if the free nv driver fails. <br><br>To get the proper compatibility with later cards you need to install the "real" nvidia drivers. The program ENVY (i told you about) is designed to do all this for you, for both the more recent Nvidia and ATIs.<br><br>You can tell when 3D acceleration is running by using the command: "glxinfo" or more specifically "glxinfo |grep direct". A frame FPS test is available by typing "glxgears". My old FX5200 would do about 1900 fps so yours should totally beat that. My laptop's ATI does around 2600. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
