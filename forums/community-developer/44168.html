But no planted keys or sliding keys (joint pining), like in Character Studio or certain ik rigs, xsi pin object, AOI pinning , etc.Its faked with a system based in complex rigs , null bones constrains and ik solver. I use just empties , ik solver and a copy constrain.<br><br>"3)If IK is supported, can feet and hand be pinned into position (frozen) while other parts are positioned?"<br><br>LOL!it's rare to see someone demanding it, apart than me.I have a feeling that in blender comunity major interest has not be human animation, but that is changing.Not many there knowing what joint pinning is(part of the problem)<br>There are workarounds , as I mentioned.<br><br>"4)Can reference pictures be loaded into the background?"<br><br>Two options: bacground picture loading, or like in wings, max , etc, just texture two planes (easy just invert a cube.The scanned pictures must match in height, pixels etc: u prepare it in adobe or gimp.)<br><br>"5)Can animated models be exported in a file format which keeps the weighted vertex positions and can be converted to B3D Ultimate Unwrap?"<br><br>yup, i think i was the main tester of it, x format.It ports weights. you have ben omari's one <a href="http://xoomer.virgilio.it/glabro1/" target="_blank">http://xoomer.virgilio.it/glabro1/</a>  or another (which I use) that slightly changed the plugin at www.mindfloaters.de<br><br>that last one i test often that works in ultimate, also the export from there as x or b3d.All tested.<br><br>Ben , the original x exporter author, is in the middle of creating an x importer.This for example will allow to animate in a better package for that matter, like xsi or max, and for example , render hair with fiber (similar to shag hair though not that powerful)..for those intereste also in high res movies, like me (the only important -to me-  feature removed from xsi 500$ is hair rendering)<br><br>All that road has many ..stones in the way.<br>but all is perfectly possible. I just bought xsi to make my life easier.<br><br>animating with xsi or cs is many times quicker or easier, be aware of that. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

With a lot o ftechnical problems for visual quality , etc.Yet though, ideal for models in a distance.Also u can expport as md3.But never tested if single piece md3 from blender (seen ok in my md3 viwers, like blender md2) will load ok with drago's blitz library.<br><br>those 2, md2, and md3, are also external plugins. The author site is down for some months. If need them , and I remember to get here again (I dont browse these forums as much as before, and definitely that is gonna decrease or disappear totally) say so, and i'll upload to a temp space, those and some others u may need and hard to find (I have them in my hd , anyway...) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I never heard of it but I went to the softimage site and had a look. The demo download is quite a lump at 160MB and then the price of 500$ is a bit too hefty for my pocket :-(<br>Anyway, is it worthwhile to have a look at the demo? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I did read somewhere that lightmaps shaders where in softimage but stripped in xsi, in some forum. but that could be old news, and i'm testing using "rendermap" for it.<br><br>One thing about it that throw no good hopes is they say valve used their in-house lightmap tool, not xsi , for lightmaps.<br><br>That is: I wanted xsi forcharacter animation. I'm very keeping in having certain features (axe restrction, limit angle, ertain condstrains, pin object) that arent in blender, and no good in other mid cost tools.(could not go over 500, or just would no worth it)But as u see, and is my point when I defend Max, games require loads of fields to cover. Max fills them all, while a package that has not been so largely used (so feedback even byu game companies, modders, polycount ppl, is enormous) in games, u dont know if A or B area is in prehistoric state due to is a film or other specific area where it comes from...<br><br>Dont get me wrong, I REALLY like XSI, but...u totally need to test deeply any tool yu like till the minimum extent you want to cover, like I did.<br><br>Imho, good buys for game artwork today, may be Game Space (though i should have tested a complex x export of character to know) is way easier, does not require that res, etc, but surely has other prblems.Maybe it is quite good and suited for games.It seems it exports weights in the x file...how well and accurate..? dunno..the old free x exporter for ts 4.3 wasnt accurate, but I'm 99% this is total new animal.<br><br>I'd love to have a cinema, but was too expensive, and no weights animation in x export yet, sadly.<br><br>ie, cinema 4d has an uber fast rendering, while being one of the nicest out there..but as the authors say, is not a tool focused on games.<br><br>Messiah version that has x export ..I havent tested, and the hash am thing..I dunnot like is not based in polygons.<br><br>Dunno, hard to give advice, each person is a world of different needs and tastes...any of this could suit..Blender, game space, cinema, xsi...it depends on the type of user (probably gamespace being the best for newbies)<br><br>Looks for your questions you are quite experienced in 3D, and if so..you may aim to Cinema 4D or XSI.<br><br>A thing to mention: if ur also interested in hi res, cinema in long shot is probably better shot, as the shave and a haircut plugin (good thing is cinema can be upgraded with specific areas modules,not uber expensive, while the basic thing is really good), and xsi instead is 6k $ for the most expensive version...is surely the best hair in the world...but i'll *never* spend 6k. Waiting for x import in blender be finished and fiber 3 lugin also..so to export low cage anim characters animated in x, and do hi res render with hair in blender...it requires "quite" an amount of learning, blender and xsi...lol..but i like hard learning XD<br><br>About the main question...I don't know how complete -for games- xsi, but how good should be out of questions, it's one of the stablished kings in films...but their workflows and needs are totally different.Half life 2 was choosen by Valve, so...I just love it for char anim.<br><br>Mustang's company has choosen it for animation of characters I think, he may tell you better, as I am only watching some of the dvds anbd slowly adapting my workflows to it, while they'r probably using in production, that is when u dig things totally. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
