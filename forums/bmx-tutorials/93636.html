Assuming the approval process is like iOS all that's left is conforming to all the design guidelines which is your responsibility... make it platform friendly, play by the rules (don't put stuff where it doesn't belong for example...) and you should be OK.<br><br>This guide assumes you have already completed all the setup in the developer center, installed your certificates, created an application bundle ID in the dev portal and prepared a submission in iTunes Connect, all you need to do is get your application from your computer to Apple and then cross your fingers...<br><br><b>Step 1: Prepare your Application</b><br>First you should have the latest version of xcode installed when you compile in bmax.<br><br>Now right or command click your program an select "Show Package Contents".<br><br>Update the icon file (Contents/Resources/*.icns) to include icons at every scale for your application (and also obviously not the bmax icon, but your own.) You can use Icon composer in the developer tools to create this file. It would be best if the icon file name doesn't contain spaces or special characters, not sure if this is a huge issue, but I just make mine match the application executable name (see next), update info.plist to match.<br><br>In your Application's contents ensure that your executable (the file in the MacOS folder) contains no special characters or SPACES in it's name. Modify your Info.plist to point the renamed executable if needed.<br><br>You must also ensure your info.plist contains a category entry pointing at the main category you are submitting for (see <a href="http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/mac/documents/submitting.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010572-CH16-SW8" target="_blank">http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/mac/documents/submitting.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010572-CH16-SW8</a> for details). You also must have a short version string (CFBundleShortVersionString, this should be something like "1.0" for your application's version number), copywrite (NSHumanReadableCopyright, this should be something like "2011 My Company, LLC."), icon file (CFBundleIconFile, "This should be the name of the icns file in the Resources folder WITHOUT the file extension,usually the same as the executable filename, such as "MyApplication") and bundle identifier (CFBundleIdentifier, this is the Identifier you created in the developer certificate utility, such as "com.mycompany.MyApplication").<br><br><br><b>Step 2: Signing</b><br>You must now code sign your app. Assuming your certs are installed correctly etc. this is quite easy.<br>Open a terminal window (with the terminal app in the applications/utilities directory)<br>Navigate to your application's directory. The easiest way is to just drag the application's folder from the finder onto the terminal window, this will auto enter the path, then just press return.<br>enter the following line, modifying as needed.<br><pre class=code>codesign -f -s "3rd Party Mac Developer Application: My Company, LLC" "My Application.app"</pre><br>3rd Party Mac Developer Application: My Company, LLC - this is your application signing certificate's FULL name as it appears in the KeyChain. Open your keychain app and poke around to find it, it will start with "3rd Party Mac Developer Application". It must be in quotes as it contains spaces and other special characters.<br>My Application.app - This is the name of your application file. Mac applications are actually folders that end with a .app file extension. If it contains spaces or other special characters you must enclose it in quotes or otherwise escape them, it's easiest just to leave it in quotes no matter what, no harm.<br>If this goes well you should get no feedback, just a new line. If you have previously signed the application it will tell you it replaced the existing signature.<br>Don't close the terminal, we need it for the next step.<br><br><b>Step 3: Packaging</b><br>The mac app store requires you package your application in a signed pkg file as well to control how it will auto install. To create a signed package you will need to get the "Application Tools" from the Mac Dev Center (scroll down to App Store Resources when you are logged in, download and install). Assuming you have the tools installed enter the following on the command line and modify as needed<br><pre class=code>productbuild --component "My Application.app" /Applications --sign "3rd Party Mac Developer Installer: My Compnay, LLC" MyApplication.pkg</pre><br>"My Application.app" - this is the name of the application file you signed in step 2, I'm unsure if you can use a folder (with other resources etc.) here or not, as I haven't needed to but I would assume you can.<br>/Applications - this is the location that your application will be installed. I believe this is currently limited to /Application and higher (such as /Applications/Utilities). Again, I haven't needed anything other than Applications so I haven't looked into it.<br>"3rd Party Mac Developer Installer: My Compnay, LLC" - The name of your INSTALLER certificate, just like the application cert in step 2, check the keychain for your exact name<br>MyApplication.pkg - the name of the package file it will create. It seems to reject spaces here as well, so best to stick with alpha-numeric only.<br><br>You should get feedback on the terminal along the lines of<br><pre class=code>productbuild: Adding component at /Volumes/Caduceus/Users/username/Documents/Dev Projects/My Application/My Application.app
productbuild: Signing product with identity "3rd Party Mac Developer Installer: My Company, LLC" from keychain /Volumes/Caduceus/Users/ima747/Library/Keychains/login.keychain
productbuild: Adding intermediate certificate "Apple Worldwide Developer Relations Certification Authority"
productbuild: Wrote product to MyApplication.pkg</pre><br><br>You can test your installer puts things in the correct place by running it, or via the command line for automated install with <pre class=code>sudo installer -store -pkg MyApplication.pkg -target /</pre><br><br><b>Step 4: Submission</b><br>Open the Application Loader program in /Developer/Applications/Utilites. Select the application from the drop down that you are going to submit. Select the package you just created and tested and hit send. It will perform some preliminary checks before sending it (for icon sizes etc.), and once submitted the server will do a few more checks. If Everything goes well you're all set! wait for apple to take a look. If you get any errors, correct them (google as needed) and re-sign, re-package, re-submit. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You can do this before hand, or during the purchase process of your Mac Developer license.<br>Purchase license with your account if you didn't make/buy at the same time. (you can tack it on to an existing iOS developer account for example).<br>Wait. Apple processes your purchase, validates you, charges you etc. and send you an email saying you're good to go (anywhere from a few minutes to a few days, possibly even longer if you're setting up a new account for a business and have to fax them some incorporation documents or other paperwork etc. this varies wildly depending on the type of developer account you set up and what exactly you're doing).<br>You now have an account. Login and through the dev center you can find links to get your developer certificates (application and installer run off different certs and you need both). They have simple step by step instructions on how to setup your certs and get them installed. Just go slow and it's easy.<br>You now have to create a bundle ID for your application. They walk you through this as well, it's simply a reverse domain style identifier used to tell your application apart from others (e.g. com.blitzmax.BlitzBasic for BlitzMax's BlitzBasic program...). You need to put this id in your info.plist so the system can track your app, issue updates, etc.<br>You are now set up to sign your applications, create installer packages, and generally get your code onto the store.<br>Head over to iTunes Connect and create a new application submission. You'll enter your app info, name, version, description, keywords, screen shots etc.<br>Once all of that is set and the application is listed as "Waiting for Binary" you can then use the application loader as described to upload (after following the tutorial to bundle it all up).<br>Then you sit back and wait for 2 hours to 30 days (usually about a week or 2 for me for iOS depending on holidays etc. for a first submission, updates are usually a bit faster, no idea yet what the Mac App Store waits will be but I'm guessing similar) for apple to approve or deny your submission. If they deny they give you (usually somewhat vague, but if you read closely you should figure out what they mean) reason(s) for your refusal. If denied, correct what they said was out of line and re-submit, no penalty besides wasted time for getting turned down (if you get turned down a lot however they might lower your submission priority meaning it takes longer to get them to look at it, so try to get it right as fast as possible rather than bouncing ideas off them.)<br><br>Of note, if you plan on selling things you will also need to agree to the legal docs regarding the payment contracts etc. through iTunes connect as well and wait for that to get approved (day to weeks again depending on who/what you are etc.) and you will need to attach the payment to a major bank account and get that validated (usually a day). If you're just doing free stuff (bear in mind, unlike iOS demos and trials are NOT welcome in the mac store... full versions only... I have a suspicion that they will be adding a demoing system in sometime in the future) then you don't need to bother with this, it's all in the main agreement when you sign up.<br><br>If anyone cares, this is almost exactly the same process for iOS developer accounts. The apps are obviously different, and the bundling is different (it must be signed in xcode, and you just zip the app with it's distribution profile rather than creating a package...), but all the legal stuff, timing, dev portals, itunes connect, etc. are all integrated together. If you have an account for both everything shows up under iTunes Connect, your mac and iOS apps, tracking, payments, etc.<br><br>Hope that helps! Just remember it's apple's playground and you have to play by their rules if you want to join in :0) thankfully, unlike iOS, if you don't like the rules you can always just go the traditional way. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Basically if you have a general question like "how do I get my certs?" you can ask and it's apple support which is just as good for devs as for consumers (read quick and people actually know what they're doing, not reading off a prompter, a.k.a. what support should be). So if you get stuck they can help. Support incidents are basically 1 on 1 support with an apple developer. Meaning you can say "Here's my code why does this leak like crazy?" (as long as you're using xcode and writing in an officially supported language of course...) and they will give it a look over and help you fix it up. I've never had to use any incidents in the couple years I've had them because the official forum (which is peppered with official apple devs) and google can usually get things rolling, but it's very nice to know there's backup should something go horribly horribly wrong, you won't be out $99 for nothing. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I know I have a couple very minor policy violations (my settings are saved in the correct location, but the file is not named to match the bundle identifier, however it is easily identifiable as as settings file for my program.) I'm guessing they just said "close enough" since it was just a tiny thing or 2.
