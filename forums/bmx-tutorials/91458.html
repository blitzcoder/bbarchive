The documentation on threading is pretty sparse so this is mainly an attempt to clarify.<br><br>The examples are intended to be "like" real work examples, in that they show you how to do something, but they may just be a framework to do it. As with any code there's a million ways to go about anything, these should in no way be considered the "right" way, just something to get you going.<br><br>It's VERY important to note that not everything is thread safe! You can't just throw code in a thread and expect it to work. However just because it's not thread safe doesn't mean you can't use it in a multi-threaded application, you just HAVE to use non thread safe things in the main thread (or sometimes just one thread only which could be a child thread as long as it's ONLY accessed from there... rule of thumb, keep it to main thread if there's any doubt)<br>Here are some examples of places you need to take special care.<br>Graphics: Graphics actions are not thread safe, this is as a result graphics systems not being thread safe (opengl and directx). They MUST be handled from the main thread. Interestingly in bmax image loading, despite creating a graphics texture, seems to work from child threads... Perhaps this is an intentional modification done to the loading process, I don't really know...<br>Events: The event que is not thread safe, and since you can't control when an event will be created you can't force it with your own mutex. One workaround however is to create your own second event que that you handle in a thread safe manner and dump that into the main que when you see fit.<br>Memory Changes: It is safe to read something in memory from multiple threads at once, however it is not safe to modify memory if it may be accessed. You can't change something from 2 places at once, and you can't change something WHILE it's being read from somewhere else. Safely managing access is the point of the bellow tutorials.<br><br>Another important thing to remember is that threads have overhead. Spawning 2 threads on a single core system will result in slower performance than just 1 since the system has to spend time managing both threads. However both will be working essentially at the same time, so if you can afford the overhead it may still make sense. More cores means you can handle more threads without them bogging each other down, however you still have to share time with the rest of the computer. This isn't usually too big of an issue for things like games where you can expect to have the user's full attention, but if you get sent to the background, or if you have a UI that allows the user to do other things (using windows instead of full screen for example) you may need to take into account what your child threads are doing and find a way to give time back to the system... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It doesn't know exactly what you are trying to protect with that mutex. It just prevents other things from running that would also lock that mutex by making their threads pause until the mutex is unlocked again. If you access a list regularly, but don't modify the list, just read it/iterate through it, you don't need to prevent multiple threads from reading it at once. If you're making changes to objects in the list you will want to ensure that no 2 threads modify a given object at the same time by using a mutex for the object in question.<br><br>If you want to minimize the locking time then you want your mutex as specific as possible (i.e. a mutex for each object). If however you want to minimize the time spend managing locks, or you want to simplify your code, you may want to just have a mutex for the list and operate under the assumption that if the list mutex is locked then the objects in the list should also be considered locked...<br><br>If you're accessing the same object from multiple lists, you probably want a mutex for that object so as to prevent access through each list to the same object multiple times. If those lists themselves can change from multiple points/threads they may need their own mutexes to prevent the list object itself from getting manipulated...<br><br>There's a lot of stuff with threading that you just have to figure out what is the best approach for you, in this project, for this task. All the locking etc. is a safety net to prevent crashes, if you never access the same things from multiple threads you don't need any of it since there is no access overlap... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

</pre><br>Note the "THIS CRASHES" line.  This code seems to run exactly as I expect it otherwise.  But here, why exactly is it crashing?  I would expect it to crash I think (occasionally at least), but I'd like to know why, because it will affect the way I do a great deal of code I think.  Is it because the list itself is not locked?  Is the list actually in use by the main thread all the while it is iterating through objects?<br>I understand now with threading that you want to be as "unsafe as safely possible" with locking to get the performance increase.  If I can understand a few more pieces of the puzzle I think I'll be ready to start using it. :)<br><br>And on a side note, I just installed 1.41, and it seems to have drastically improved the performance gains of threading.  I unhooked my code (15k lines) from all timers or delays and was running at about 4-5x normal speed before, but now it's literally 100x faster.  Hours of gameplay flash by in seconds.  I doublechecked my compile settings and all sorts of things and it really does seem the update did this.  I hope it stays this way, or that I'm not crazy. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You can read anywhere as much as you want, but if you change anything you have to stop everything related to that change. i.e. you can iterate a list from 3 threads at once no problem, but if one thread adds or removes from the list all the other threads must make sure the list is not being modified while they iterate it...<br><br>changes requires locking to be safe. anything that is reading what could be changed needs to respect the changing locks. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
