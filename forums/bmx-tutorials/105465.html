Click here to go to Mark Sibly's Patreon page.</b></a></u><br><br>--<br><br>So with <u><a href="/img/blitz3d.php" target="_blank">Blitz3D</a></u>, <u><a href="/img/blitzplus.php" target="_blank">BlitzPlus</a></u>, and <u><a href="/img/blitzmax.php" target="_blank">BlitzMax</a></u> now free we've got a lot of new people visiting these forums. That's great! It makes the forums a lot more active and makes them a more interesting and informative place to visit. Unfortunately it also means that we have a lot of new people who don't know where to start learning about the Blitz languages, or about programming and game-making in general. This is why I've put together the information below to help get new Blitzers started on their journey with the Blitz programming languages.<br><br>Feel free to post any suggestions regarding information that you feel should be added to the post below, as long as it's 'where to go to learn the basics' type information. Tutorials should be posted in the <u><a href="/topics.php?forum=88" target="_blank">Blitz3D</a></u>, <u><a href="/topics.php?forum=100" target="_blank">BlitzPlus</a></u>, or <u><a href="/topics.php?forum=112" target="_blank">BlitzMax</a></u> tutorial forums.<br><br>If you have questions about a specific topic that you want more information on then I'd suggest starting a separate thread rather than posting those questions below. This thread is intended to be about providing basic information to help new people get started learning about the languages.<br><br><br>--<br><br><br>To get a copy of Blitz3D, BlitzPlus, and BlitzMax you'll first need to register an account on this site  via the <u><a href="/Account/signup.php" target="_blank">'Signup'</a></u> link on the top-right corner of the page. Once you have your account setup you will be able to login via the nearby <u><a href="/Account/login.php" target="_blank">'Login'</a></u> link. You can then click the <u><a href="/Account/_index_.php" target="_blank">'Account'</a></u> link in the main menu bar and then the <u><a href="/Account/produpdates.php" target="_blank">'Product updates'</a></u> link in the sub-menu below the main menu bar which will take you to the page where you can download the products. Note that you'll need to be logged-in for the 'Account' and 'Product updates' links to work.<br><br>The best place to get started learning about a Blitz programming language product is in the help documentation that came with the product. To find the help documentation first open the editor for the Blitz product (the editor is also known as the IDE, which is short for <u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment" target="_blank">Integrated Development Enviroment</a></u>). Then click the 'Help' tab in the editor. You should see a list of topics followed by a short decription of the topic.<br><br>You can also find the <u><a href="/Manuals/_index_.php" target="_blank">command references for the various Blitz products</a></u> by clicking the 'Manuals' link in the main menu on this website. This online version of the Command Reference information is likely to be more up-to-date than the information that comes with the product download, and it includes user comments that may make some things clearer.<br><br>The first thing you should do before starting on a programming project, working with a code sample, or asking questions on the forum is to read through the help documentation and get at least a rough overview of what's available in the language and how the language works. You don't need to learn it all at once. Just skim through it to begin with and re-read it later on as your understanding grows and you gain a better grasp of the concepts involved. You can also find user-created online tutorials for <u><a href="/topics.php?forum=88" target="_blank">Blitz3D</a></u>, <u><a href="/topics.php?forum=100" target="_blank">BlitzPlus</a></u>, and <u><a href="/topics.php?forum=112" target="_blank">BlitzMax</a></u> that address various topics. Bear in mind that some of these user-created tutorials may include information that is incorrect, despite the best intentions of the user who created them.<br><br>Once you have at least a basic understanding of the language and how it's used then you should have a look through some of the code samples that are included with the help documentation (you should see a link to the folder they are in on the page that shows when you click the 'Help' tab in the IDE). Have a skim through them, run them, and then have a play with the running program. I recommend that you don't edit the original code for the code samples though. You'll probably want to leave this code in it's original state so that you can refer back to it. Instead, create a copy of the folder that a code sample that interests you is in. Or you may want to just copy the entire 'samples' folder to a new location. If you copy a specific code sample to its own location then you should be aware that some of the code samples may be dependent on external files that set their graphics mode, etc. For Blitz3D, the samples in the 'mak' folder all depend on the 'start.bb' file found in that folder for example, and you will get an error message if the 'mak' samples can't find that file. Some of the 'mak' samples may also depend on the 'b3dlogo.jpg' image file found in the 'mak' parent folder. A good place to start learning to code is to investigate the code to find out how those dependencies work and research how you can localize them to the folder the code sample is in.<br><br>Another good place to go looking for sample code to play with and learn from is the <u><a href="/codearcs.php" target="_blank">Code Archives section of this website</a></u>. This section of the site is mainly for people to post code that provides solutions to specific problems, but most of the code there also comes with standalone demo code to demonstrate its use. You can also find the occasional complete project there to play around with. The code in the code archives is all <u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain" target="_blank">public domain</a></u> code, so you can do whatever you want with it - which includes using it in a commercial product. To find the link to the Code Archives just click on the 'Community' link in the main menu bar and you will find the Code Archives linked in the sub-menu on any page in the Community section of the site.<br><br>Note that there's no search function in the Code Archives, so you'll need to use Google's 'Search within a specific site' functionality to search for a specific topic there. To do that, go to the <u><a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google search engine page</a></u> (or use the Google search box in your web browser) and type the text in the code box below into the search box (substitute the 'your search term goes here' text for whatever search term you're looking for).<br><pre class=code>site:http://www.blitzbasic.com/codearcs/codearcs.php your search term goes here</pre><br>There are many interesting and useful areas of this website, so take the time to navigate around and see what's here. Bear in mind though that some of the sections that feature off-site links may include a lot of dead links. A few sections that you may find useful are the <u><a href="/toolbox/toolbox.php" target="_blank">Toolbox</a></u>, the <u><a href="/logs/logs.php" target="_blank">Worklogs</a></u>, the <u><a href="/gallery/gallery.php" target="_blank">Gallery</a></u>, and many others.<br><br>A harsh reality of coding with Blitz3D and BlitzPlus is that the default IDEs for them are complete rubbish. They should have been put out of their misery and replaced with something better a decade ago. <u><a href="/toolbox/toolbox.php?cat=11" target="_blank">Fortunately many clever users have created alternative IDEs that are much better.</a></u> Many of these are free, including many people's favorite <u><a href="/toolbox/toolbox.php?tool=186" target="_blank">IDEal</a></u>.<br><br>The best way to learn how to create games and other coding projects is to start out with small, simple projects and work your way up to larger projects as your experience and skill grows. Focus on projects where you have at least a basic idea of how you're going to achieve the goals for that project.<br><br><br><b>-- Using the Forums and Asking Questions --</b><br><br>You can find the answers to a variety of Blitz related questions on this website's <u><a href="/faq/faq.php" target="_blank">FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) page</a></u>. The link to the FAQs page can be found in the sub-menu below the main menu bar on the forum pages and the site's <u>[a /]Home page[/a]</u>.<br><br><u><a href="/faq/faq_entry.php?id=1" target="_blank">You can find the Terms of Use for the Blitz website, forums, etc by clicking here.</a></u> <u><a href="/posts.php?topic=49197" target="_blank">You can find James's (BlitzSupport's) grumpy post about proper conduct on the forums by clicking here.</a></u><br><br>There are a variety of <u><a href="/faq/faq_entry.php?id=2" target="_blank">forum codes</a></u> you can use to make your forum posts easier to read and to also add links, images, Youtube videos, and a number of other things to them. You can find a link to the forum codes above the post boxes used to create a new thread, post in an existing one, or edit a post you've already made.<br><br>If you make a mistake in your forum post and need to edit it then you can find the 'Edit' link near the top-right corner of your post.<br><br>If you make a mistake in the title of a forum thread you've started and need to edit it then you can find the 'Edit' link near the top-right corner of your first post in the thread. The edit page should include a 'Topic title:' text box that lets you edit the topic title.<br><br>If you make a mistake and start a thread in the wrong forum then the best way to fix it is to contact Blitz support via the <u><a href="/Contact/_index_.php" target="_blank">Contact page</a></u>. You can find the link to the contact page in the main menu bar at the top of each page on the site. Note that it may sometimes take several days to get a response, so be patient.<br><br>If you want to post a link to a specific post within a thread then you can find the link for the post via the number preceded by a hash '#' character on the top-right corner of the post. Just right-click on the number and use the 'Copy link address', 'Copy shortcut', etc option in the popup menu to copy the link address.<br><br>If you want to search the forums for specific information then you can find a variety of options for searching on the <u><a href="/_index_.php" target="_blank">main forum page</a></u> as well as on specific forums. Before asking for help on the forums it's generally a good idea to try searching the forums first to see if the question has already been asked and answered. Many people encounter a problem and then rush to the forum to ask how to solve it without bothering to research further, which gets annoying fast.<br><br>Before asking for programming help on the forum, first make sure that you have at least a basic understanding of the programming language you are using and of the topic you are asking about. Follow the directions at the start of this post to learn the basics of the programming language and of programming in general. Use the forum search to find previous discussions on the topic. Use Google or other search engines to find articles, etc on the topic. You'll be able to ask much more intelligent questions and gain a much greater understanding of the answers you receive if you take the time to educate yourself on the topic in question first.<br><br>Basically, you're welcome to ask questions on the forums. We were all beginners once. No one's going to hate you for asking a question that you're stuck on and have put a reasonable level of effort into understanding and solving yourself. Just try to avoid asking questions that you could have easily found the answer to yourself, or questions that you haven't taken the time to research and don't have the background knowledge to understand as a result.<br><br>If you have any  problems that require you to contact Blitz Research directly (issues with your account, etc) then you can contact Blitz support via the <u><a href="/Contact/_index_.php" target="_blank">Contact page</a></u>. You can find the link to the contact page in the main menu bar at the top of each page on the site.
