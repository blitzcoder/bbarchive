Best would be if the context field is completely free and another one is only used internally. <br></div><br><b>SebHoll:</b><br><div class="quote"> Unfortunately, the <b>context</b> field in <b>TGadget</b> is there specifically for storing the parameter passed by <b>SetGadgetFilter()</b>. Perhaps you need a new <b>GadgetExtra()</b>/<b>SetGadgetExtra()</b> function pair? ;-) <br></div><br><b>jsp:</b><br><div class="quote"> It's off topic now and i don't want to harvest this thread could you may put it in an extra one? Also to ask others what they think about it.<br><br>Actually a <b>GadgetExtra()/SetGadgetExtra()</b> should have been there from the start (like for listitems), because now we have the problem with backward compatibility. My suggestion would be to take a new field for the SetGadgetFilter and a function pair as you suggested to set/get the context field. As skid approved that we can use it, probably a lot have it in use in their programs and changing only the filter for the TextField and the TextArea is much easier and would not hurt anybody.  If you could implement it now with MaxGuiEx that would really be fine, because than there is an official way we can go. <br></div> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Yes it would have been better if they were there from the start (because of the equally useful item extra fields), but No, I don't think that the <b>SetGadgetFilter()</b> context field should've been used instead.<br><br>Even for those people who have decided to use it for their own purposes, the new <b>extra</b> field won't break that functionality - they can still access the <b>context</b> field in the same way. It's just that the new proper place to store such object pointers would be in the <b>extra</b> field using the two new functions. With all these tweaks I make to MaxGUI, I don't want to get in a position where the code makes even less sense than it does at the moment, and we are in serious danger of doing that by using fields for different purposes for which they were originally intended.<br><br>I'm sure it was made clear that people shouldn't access the TGadget objects directly to ensure compatability with future versions - although it's tempting sometimes, usually alternatives can be found such as using TProxyGadget instead.<br><br><div class="quote"> If you could implement it now with MaxGuiEx that would really be fine, because than there is an official way we can go. <br></div><br>I've had a look into the implementation and seem to have a cross-platform working solution - the drivers aren't really affected as it's an internal change inside <b>MaxGUI.MaxGUI</b>. As originally described, it simply entails having two new functions:<br><br><b>SetGadgetExtra()</b> and <b>GadgetExtra()</b><br><br>The only problem I can see is whether or not we should pass this value along with gadget events (which don't already use the EventExtra() parameter) - my thoughts are that we shouldn't as we shouldn't be confusing the gadget and event extra properties as they won't always be the same (e.g. treeview events). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
