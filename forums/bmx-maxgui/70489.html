While all this is no problem when it stays intact in Logic Gui and calling an editor (as it is now), it could be a huge problem the other way round.

That means the menu-structure can change without recompiling the source. A user could add a hotkey of his own choice or you could reorganize your menu and move an entry to another place. <br><br>Import a language file! The problem with foreign languages is, that you may not know the correct word or spelling. So if you decide to go for a multi language application, it is may wise to have somebody who talks the language as mother tongue. The idea is now to spread the program together with the xml file and let people/user fill in the right words. You can then collect from various sources and import all pending languages without extra work. As the xml file contains also the 'comment' of Logic Gui you can give extra information for best results.<br><br>As usual: Check out the news on my website for all details and pictures (use the link from the signature) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I like it a lot but I have a few suggestions and a couple of bug reports. I haven't read through every post in every LogicGUI discussion, so sorry if these are duplicates.<br><br>Bug 1: Let's say I am editing a gadget called "Widget1" in the Gadget Control Center. I adjust Widget1's height, width, and so on, click "update", then hit the little green "run" arrow to preview my layout. When I close the preview window, Widget1 is still in the Gadget Control Center window, and the program allows me to change values and click "update", but no changes are made to the actual Widget1 object. I have to deselect and re-select Widget1 to make changes after running the code from LogicGUI.<br><br>Bug2 + suggestion: I have a vertical splitter. One the left, I have a tabber and a listbox. On the right, at the top, I have a panel. In the right-hand side of the splitter, under the panel, I created a scroll panel. When I tried to run the code, I got a "Duplicate identifier" error. LogicGUI generated the code like this:<br><pre class=code>
Local ScrollPanel1_Type:TScrollPanel = TScrollPanel.Create:TScrollPanel( 221,37,578,563,2000,2000,MainWindow:TGadget,0,19 )
Local ScrollPanel1_Main:TGadget = ScrollPanel1_Type.MainPanel
SetGadgetLayout( ScrollPanel1:TGadget,EDGE_ALIGNED,EDGE_ALIGNED,EDGE_RELATIVE,EDGE_ALIGNED )
Local ScrollPanel1:TGadget = ScrollPanel1_Type.VirtualPanel
</pre><br>If you look closely at the bottom two lines, you'll see they should be swapped. SetGadgetLayout creates ScrollPanel1 then the next line tries to create a Local ScrollPanel1. Now I cannot preview my layout. Whenever I want to test my layout, now, I have to generate the code, go into the editor, manually swap those two lines and then compile. That leads me to my suggestion (you may already be doing this, but the error above made me think of it): It would be great if you made sure the LogicGUI code was SuperStrict compatible.<br><br>A few suggestions: Drag-on rulers would be very useful. I am thinking along the lines of the rulers in Photoshop that you can drag onto the canvas in order to align stuff and give gadgets extra places to snap to.<br><br>LogicGUI really needs an undo command. Because of all the grouping and the complicated layouts that can be created, it is very easy to majorly screw something up by accidentally resizing or moving a bunch of gadgets. An undo feature would really be nice.<br><br>The "snap" feature doesn't work very well for me. I find it very hard to make use of snapping objects to the grid. Sometimes, items move very jerkily as I try to slide them to the left and they want to snap back to the right and most of the time, I end up off by a few pixels because it is really easy to move gadget after it has snapped. Even when I am very careful with my trackball, I find it easy to nudge a gadget one or two pixels even after it has snapped. I think this has something to do with the snap only working when you are moving in a certain direction, which is counter-intuitive.<br><br>Also, I would really like to see snap work when resizing a gadget. For instance, if I drag a panel to the right, I would like that right edge to snap as I drag.<br><br>It would be nice to be able to see the grid on top of the gadgets. Right now, once you lay a gadget on top of the grid, the grid is gone. It would be nice to have a "bring to front/send to back" for the grid.<br><br>FInally, I wish LogicGUI would warn me when I try to put a gadget in an illegal place. It took me forever to figure out that I couldn't put stuff at 0, 0 relative to parent gadgets. I would design a layout, hit "run" and my window would be empty. I finally realized that LogicGUI wasn't generating code for any of my gadgets because they were one pixel too far to the left or right, or one pixel too wide or tall.<br><br>I hope you find some of that useful.<br><br>SpaceAce <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Others out here who want them, i can push them up a bit in my list...<br><br>Interesting that nobody ever asked for a undo, i was waiting for it :) There will be an undo for certain functions, but i have no date yet.<br><br>The snap is snapping to the top left corner. When moving fast the snap is suppressed to avoid jumping. If you move slow the snap is snapping when in range of the grid. This range can be adjusted in the ini file. So when using a coarse grid you can position your gadget everywhere in between without problems, when coming close to the grid the gadget will snap. I didn't have any plan to snap to the right but can put it on my list. When using snap may use the magnifier to verify.<br><br>I never saw a grid on top, but that can be may useful and should not that hard to do. So – wish granted :) But i wonder if you could use the Layer Window. Please open it and select all layer on top and move the slider on the right towards zero. This will make your gadgets shine through and your grid underneath visible.<br><br>But for the last point i have to say sorry, there will be no warning. We had some discussion about that before and i took out all references in the code to prevent putting gadgets at 0,0 - i will not put them back. Once you know it should be ok (it's somewhere in the docs and is used by the parser), but can be also very useful, because you could 'park' your gadgets easily and fast just outside and there will be no source for them, best during trying several things out. Move them back and they are active again you don't have to delete them and re-create afterwards.<br><br>Thanks for reporting all this, very appreciated.<br><br>I can send you a new version this weekend if that's ok. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Logic Gui adds the SetStatusText command always gadget related, but you need it inside the event loop. Normally this is not needed as all events are handled and you could put any command in the specific event function, but you found a good example where it make sense to have also access to the inner loop itself to be event unspecific. I can add a raw event function or a add an inner loop file. I will check it this weekend. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
