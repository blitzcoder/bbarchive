However there is only so much one person can do, and the features many feel are missing from MaxGUI, such as colours (win32), more events, a decent linux gui (instead of fltk - brucey's gtk is brilliant), more styles (such as setting windows as always on top, SetMaxWinSize() ), more gadgets (such as hyperlink labels etc, dockable toolbars), and the odd stuff missing from BlitzPlus (desktop buffers) etc. I suppose Skid either isn't being payed, or doesn't have time to do.<br><br>At the moment, the Max3D module is still in BETA and MaxGUI is the only module BRL have officially released. Is it just me that feels BRL could allocate more resources to this module so it at least has a chance of competing with PureBasic etc? I hope I can continue my GUI-editor development in BlitzMax without having to convert to PureBasic.<br><br>Please post your comments and views here,<br><br><br>Seb<br><br>P.S. I know people say BlitzMax is supposed to be used for making games, and PureBasic is better suited to applications, but it doesn't have to be this way. BlitzMax's modular strcuture should allow the flexibility to become the language for whatever purpose it is needed for.<br><br><i>&lt;/rant&gt;</i> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Its far from what I would call crossplattform. There is stuff that only works on OSX (which strangly gets or got enough to too much attention. It has its 2nd or 3rd evolution *first one was the one created at the beginning which was dropped for OSX 10.3+ GUI* of GUI module although OSX is most likely the smallest userbase with most different OS behaviors)<br><br>I understand, that quite some users got their MaxGUI for free as BPlus owners. But I was no BPlus owner, nor do I get any price reduction in case I buy BPlus from what seen on the page, so I think its fair that I want my bought product to be supported and bug fixed. If the windows color / alpha problems can't be solved, no problem. Just remove the functionality from Apple as well until the problems on Windows are fixed or a new module for Windows (XP+) is created which does not suffer all the Win95 API UI problems. (On OSX, the 10.1 UI was dropped for "new" features, while on windows still stone age stuff is used. As example, the used textarea gadget is a Win98 version although there is a new version available for win98 which is default in the only current windows version) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

From the few applications I've written (generally to manipulate and display stats) it's been superb. The issue I see is many people are using Bmax for varied things. I would like some 2D enhancements, others are crying out for Max3D, some want a stricter OO approach,  while others, like yourself, want MaxGUI to be enhanced. <br>Go to any forum for any of this genre of programming language and you're likely to see the same discussions but on different issues.<br>As always resource to do these things is limited but, most frustratingly for me,  there is no visibility on what's in the pipeline. <br>In addition, I thought the enterprising souls might have come up with many additional modules : Physics, map editors, GUIs, particle systems etc. There's a few out there but it's all a bit haphazard and many don't get finished. <br>It's as if BRL have said "Here's an amazing, powerful, easily extendable language so get stuck in as we're not intending to do any more (other than Max3D)". Normally, as in B3D add-ons, it's some brilliant/driven individual that comes up with the extras. It just doesn't seem to have happened on the same scale with Bmax. I'm not one for community projects as they never seem to get finished but maybe we should mobilise ourselves more.<br>Anyway, lost the thread a bit and I don't have the spare time to commit to anything so I'll shut up. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I opened up a lot more events for GTK for things just like this (there's even an example in the GTK dist showing a hyperlink label implementation). It's something that should be easy to do for the other platforms too.<br>Exposing more events for ALL gadgets will add a *lot* more functionality to MaxGUI.<br><br>Hey Skid, if you do go the way of a table/multi col listbox gadget, I'd be especially appreciative if you could give me a heads-up on the API changes as you go, as it would allow me to  keep the GTK mod in sync with maxgui (rather than trying to play catch up). ;-)<br><br>Personally, I think MaxGUI is excellent, especially having the source-code available.
