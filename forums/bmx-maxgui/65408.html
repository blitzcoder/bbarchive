And before you answer: "a violin has more playing functionality than a piano", I could answer: "dedicated/special controls could offer more functionality than the standard ones".<br><br>With that in mind, what about my spinner (see some recent debate about it)?  It does offer a lot more functionality than standard OS spinners (which btw are not natively present in BMaxGUI), yet it's a 'dreaded canvas object', probably not designed like Microsoft and Apple would design it.
