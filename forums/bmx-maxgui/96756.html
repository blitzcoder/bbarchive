Using more than one hook is no problem, but is a little different way it works.<br><br><div class="quote"> The application I am making has 2 canvas', group boxes with device information (gps and proton magnetometer) and timers to handle streaming serial data (rs232).

With a hook you can react immediately on a certain event which gives a lot better GUI feeling, redraw of a canvas, moving of a slider, resizing a window to name a few. It is also possible to have a more OOP approach with hooks than without, but for small forms it is quite irrelevant, the more important for bigger forms. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I have created about 20 different custom gadgets. One example is a gadget proxy that doubles as a dialogue window that can be extended. There is a single hook for all dialogue gadgets that will filter events and pass them onto the dialogue gadget in question.<br><br>I have a property grid gadget, a special canvas gadget and many more. Each has a hook to manage and pass on events to their respected objects.<br><br>If you are only ever going to have a limited number of gadgets and not much complexity in your app then it is probably easier to just use one hook for everything.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Very helpful! Im using LogicGUI for making my app, so much easier using this than trying to start out by hand!

If you are planning to have something like a preference window or popup editor windows then it would be easier in the long run to have a hook just for these so you don't have to trawl through one gigantic select statement as your program code grows larger with more and more features! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It will show how it works.<br>You can get hooked independent types from Panels and Windows (with other stuff on top of course) and you can create as many instances as you need in your program.<br>It is may a bit more difficult because then you are going OOP with your GUI, but nice in the long run.<br><br>The standard is a normal WaitEvent() loop, but when you chose in the Properties Editor, Application on the left side and in the tabber on the right 'Gadget', you will see the Option 'Type Creation' , just check this option to have it done automatically. Make a copy of your form and experiment with it.<br><br>There is also a section at the end of the User Manual which cares about the type structure, so one better understands what Logic Gui has created and how to use it.<br>There are different chapters which can be important:<br>8.2.4.2 Gadgets , Look for the Type Creation section<br>12.2 How to ..<br>13.2 TForm<br>13.3 TFormTimer<br><br>If this is too much or you are unsure what all this means just let me know. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
