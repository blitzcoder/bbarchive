It's been a while since I've been around these parts as I've moved on from BMax development myself but I've noticed that a lot of people are still pining for various different enhancements/support for MaxGUI.  <br><br>I've yet to run this by Skid or anyone from BRL so I've no idea whether this is possible under the new open-source license agreement, but 'd be interested to see what the interest would be for me to provide, what would now be considered, third-party support?  This may require forking the current repo to my own branch, or maybe even starting a MaxGUI 2, but I wanted to check whether there'd be sufficient interest first.<br><br>I guess this would predominantly take the form of continuing MaxGUI support much like I used to, and maybe implementing some of the long awaited features such as multi-column list support and/or things like composite improved drag n' drop support and new controls.  But of course, I'd have to feel like it was worth my time.<br><br>So my questions to the MaxGUI community are:<br><br>a) Would this be something you would be interested in?<br>b) What would be the top 3 features you would want and how much would this be worth to you?<br>c) Any other thoughts/feelings on the matter?<br><br>With the release of Monkey I'm not sure what the future of MaxGUI would be and whether it is worth continuing to build on it.  I'm just concerned that a lot of people still heavily rely on it and at the moment, I feel like its getting no attention.<br><br>Finally, as I said, I've not spoken to Skid/Mark at all about this yet, and as such it may not be kosha with them.  I'm kinda just thinking out loud, so don't hold you breath.<br><br>SebHoll <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In case of upgrades this doesn't cause headaches...<br><br>I first would like to have implemented all current features really on all platforms. (of course if they supported by the OS)<br><br>Here only some issues I could not understand:<br><br>- Windows_Center of a big Window does not work on EEE-PC<br><br>- No optical difference at "Selected"-State in a icon-based Toolbar()-Gadget on MAC<br><br>- All Tabs painted together when first open a TABBER()-Gadget on MAC (picture= <a href="http://www.blitzforum.de/upload/file.php?id=10645)" target="_blank">http://www.blitzforum.de/upload/file.php?id=10645)</a><br><br>- Problems with SetGadgetSensitifity() on a ComboBox()-Gadget<br><br>So... for me it would be more important to have a fast responding support in case of bugs and other "features", who publish a update within some days (or weks) ...<br>Like Brucey does with all his MODs.

Thanks everyone for your comments. I'd be really keen to implement a multi-column listbox cross-platform and shouldn't think this would be too hard.  I'd also be quite keen for looking again into drag 'n' drop treeviews.  I'd also like to implement native scroll panels that work properly with mousewheels etc.<br><br>I've had a think about this and looked into the license details, and at present, I can't think of a model that would be fair on both the potential re-investors whilst complying with MaxGUI's new open-source nature.  Yep, I could fork a private branch (I think), but this wouldn't be fair on the community or Mark or Skid for that matter, who so kindly donated it to public domain. .net support sounds like quite an interesting proposition (I'm working in WPF at the mo) but I'd have to write a completely new MaxGUI driver for it.<br><br>The best idea I've come up with so far is to maybe sell an ongoing support-based service.  If I set up a private support forum where people can post queries and support tickets for MaxGUI and I'll handle them much like I used to over here at BB.com. Those buying into it would have the opportunity to post their own bug reports/feature requests and have immediate access to my latest revision in a private repository.  Then, after testing, these changes would periodically be pushed back out to the official branch.  This way, I think, everyone wins. :-)<br><br>The only problem I see with this is that all requests aren't equal and it would be at my discretion which ones get priority.  That is unless we had some sort of tiered member system, but then this sounds like it's getting complicated. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
