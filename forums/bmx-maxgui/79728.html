Flexibility?  Could you somehow embed the new parameters in the event?<br><br><br>These are very good answers.  I am looking for one missing link, and that is a way for GUI elements to 'read' global values once they change and adjust their displayed setting to match those values.    This is easy if you have each gadget redraw every cycle, but of course that is wasteful of cpu resources.  I suppose an event hook could call the appropriate gadget redraws, and the gadgets would read global values.  This is still not a 'universal' technique, because I would still need to link the appropriate GUI elements together in the source code.<br><br><br>A better solution might be to have some means of "watching" a variable.  Whenever that variable changed, it would notify all gui elements which are connected to that variable.  Of course, you'd have to build a list of which elements are associated with which variable, but that would be easy to perform just once during the initial gadget creation.<br><br><br>Hmm, I think I could do this in a custom type..

This means that your objects don't need to be global (=potentially messy), and one object doesn't need to contain a reference to another object (=hardwiring).<br><br>btw, if we split your RGB changer into 3 components (r,g and b) then each 'thing' you need is a composite of resetbutton, slider and editbox. Why not make that composite into a new object reacting on unique new events?<br><br>You eventually create 3 such components, or you don't bother and create 1 big RGB component with 3 resets, 3 sliders and 3 editboxes. Either way: such a big complete 'rgb machine' has these methods:<br><br>- Changevalue(component,value) ' component: 0:r, 1:g, 2:b<br><br>It sends out these events:<br><br>- Colorchanged (an event sent whenever you change the color, other objects elsewhere will hear this event and update according to the new rgb settings, you could add Self to the extra field of the tevent object to actually send the rgb values to the listening objects via the event system, which is not hardwiring, yet the listener does have access to the source!)<br>- Colorchanging (an event sent when you are moving sliders but haven't released these sliders, afaik this is not possible with native sliders, but it is possible with canvas-based new sliders. This may be useful, you could change a palette overview with this event and update a picture (which is more heavy to update) when you send out a Colorchanged event)<br>- Colorstartchange (an event sent out when you first touch the sliders, this may not really be needed, but you could signal a heavy section (like an image) to not listen to Colorchanging events until a Colorchanged event has been sent, to prevent timeconsuming updates while changing colors)<br><br>It can listen to these events:<br><br>- Changecolor (for instance, you colorpick somewhere in an image, and the resulting RGB values should be sent back to your RGB sliders, the event.extra field should then contain the object that handled the colorpicking OR simply contain an int containing the RGB value, which could as well be stored in the .x, .y, .data fields for all I care)<br><br><br><br>The nice bit is that you can have as many RGB sliders as you want, you only need to create them and place them, and they will work instantly, without connecting anything. Because it sends out events, it'll work right out of the box.<br><br>Also nice: you can take them away and your program won't be buggy, it just lacks features, but it won't give errors. It will send out events, but when no-one listens, nothing happens. If however you hardwire things, you will get errors! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I am beginning to view the GUI from a much more 'separated' OOP perspective, which is clearly advantageous.<br><br>This piques my interest over events.  There is more to them than I am immediately familiar with.  For example, I have not yet dealt with this "extra" field of the tevent object. I have only played with System Timer events, which send their own custom messages.  From your description, however, it looks like I can create a tevent object from within a method, set its fields to various values, and then emit that event to Blitzmax's event distribution system.<br><br>When I place an object in the 'extra' field of the tevent object, what happens?  Does the event send a message specifically to that instance/type?  If either of these are true, where in the object's code is that message received (i.e. what function/method is called)?  Or am I wrong assuming messages can be sent directly to objects?<br><br>If you wouldn't mind describing a little more about how to use custom events (or pointing me to a good in-depth tutorial), I'd be very grateful!

If so, I can create a 'base' interface for use in many projects, and then simply 'extend' it with a custom interface type that is specific for each particular program's functions.<br><br>It's probably not the 'best' OOP solution in terms of separability, but I think it suits my needs well enough.<br><br><br>It's past midnight here so I'm off to bed otherwise I'd answer my own question tonight.  I will test it out after work tomorrow afternoon.. if no one's responded.  Just was looking for a quick answer if anyone had ever tried something like that before..<br><br><br><br>EDIT:   I figured I'd include my current code, just for kicks.    Please note this is the 'base' interface class I was describing.   Eventually it will contain within it all "non-specific" framework functions, such as handling window open/close, menu function (i.e. opening up the options window which will allow you to change the resolution of the canvas), minimize/maximize events, window moving, etc.<br><br>After that's built, I'll extend an 'Application-Specific' Sub-Type upon the base class, which will add all the buttons, tabs, sliders, etc that pertain to my specific program -- not to mention the canvas operations (likely an OpenGL context). This is why I'll need the sub-type's gadgets to be able to child-group with the base class' window.<br><br><br>Note how the canvas moves around 'locked' to the 'interface window'.  That was Kev's idea (thanks again!) to use an event hook upon the EVENT_WindowMove, since MDI isn't officially supported.<br><br><br>enough english, more blitzmax:<br><br><textarea class=codebox name="code" wrap=OFF readonly="true" rows="15" cols="80">SuperStrict
