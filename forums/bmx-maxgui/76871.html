The official IDE needed to become a bit more robust as far as internal event handling was concerned (e.g. when compiling the IDE with Brucey's GTKMaxGUI module, buttons could be activated simply by moving the mouse over them because the event ID wasn't checked for incoming events - just the source. This was fine when buttons only generated one event but in the future they *may* [no, I'm not hinting at anything] generate more).<br><br>Also, the requesters just looked a bit untidy - the gadgets weren't aligned properly/consistently, and the gadget dimensions weren't suitable for all platforms. Also, they didn't work very well on Mac OS X. This update was basically made to fix these issues, to make the official IDE at least usable for first time BlitzMax users.<br><br>As for the <i>Find in Files</i> - it was half done already, and I had (up until now) used a separate program (Agent Ransack) to do this. Knowing that investing an hour or so finishing this off would save me many more in the future, I thought it was a worthy thing to finish off while I was at it - trust me, in the last few days it has paid for itself many times over<br><br>Rest assured I'm not trying to rival the CE IDE or anything - it was mainly a bug fix release than anything else.<br><br><div class="quote"> Fancy contributing to the CE IDE?<br><br>...unless of course Seb's got that planned? <br></div><br>I would if I had time (and had wondered whether I should set some time aside to hack it in for you) but since <b>jsp</b> has tried to get <b>MaxGUI.Win32MaxGUIEx</b> working with LogicGUI, I'm up to my eyeballs in Win32 API as a result of Vista/XP GUI incompatabilities.
