Extract the zip there and then drop the newer maxide.bmx (v1.43) over the old one (v1.40). I don't think it makes much difference though. Then open maxide.bmx and make sure the code at the top looks like below.

I didn't know about the newer MaxIDE, and your original post made finding and installing it quick and painless.<br><br>I'm getting used to the dependencies issue, and a search on the Blitz forums turned up most of the info needed. The main problem was that the package manager won't install some of the 32-bit packages, or even show them. I had to manually download and install them, and for a few, extract and copy the .so files because the installer refused to do it. Apparently there are problems (<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/aspell-en/%2Bbug/1096669" target="_blank"><u>1</u></a>,<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit/%2Bbug/1185771" target="_blank"><u>2</u></a>) with flag settings on some 32-bit packages.<br><br>Turns out the PC is actually running Mint 17.1, so I'm going to install 17.2, and try again in that. Hopefully it'll be more successful this time (and if not, there's always 32-bit linux in a virtual machine :)<br><br>I saw dawlane's script, or one very like it when installing 1.50, and it helped a lot, as well as mentioning <i>Import "-ldl"</i> (which includes MaxIDE). There's also a <a href="/posts.php?topic=101357" target="_blank"><u>thread</u></a> about the dependencies for bah.gtkmaxgui on 64-bit Ubuntu.<br><br>Thanks again for your help. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
