I'm really struggling to put together a half-decent looking app, and half the time it's my fault, I'll be the first to admit that.But the other half of the time, it's not my fault, MaxGUI is sorely in need of more gadgets and a lot more little details for the existing gadgets. And yeah, these are not a priority for most people, so I can't really blame BRL for focussing on Max2D and Max3D. I'm a realist, I know that's what the majority would prefer. So I'm wondering if anyone is using anything else.<br><br>I've looked around and seen various GUI toolkits for use with C++, but most of them would be a real bugger to wrap for Max. I'm currently looking at Ultimate++ which looks more Max-friendly ( nice clean interface, and a MinGW build ) but it's going to be an awful lot of work away from my game if I decide to do it, so I'd really prefer not to if there's an existing alternative with better gadgets.<br><br>I suppose it's too much to hope that there's a way to use VC# 2005's gadget toolset in Max somehow? I do recall someone saying you could use VC# 2005 DLL's in Max, but perhaps not to this extent? I don't care about the .Net Framework overhead, the game isn't going to use any of this GUI stuff anyway, just all my editing tools. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I struggle understanding the layout of the code, let alone anything else, but if anyone has information, tutorials, examples on working with MaxGUI, perhaps I could make it my own.

The game I'm working on, by itself, is probably going to take 2 or 3 years, so I'm not sure if I want to stick another few months on top of that for GUI development. Maybe I should just live with all the missing features and gadgets, since I'm the only person using it. It just makes life developing the game with my tools that much more enjoyable if my GUI is professional. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's a complete toolkit in which you can edit almost all aspects of the game, and I may even have a preview option so that the game plays from within the editor. ( Probably not, but it'll be close to possible. ) Either way, the entire game engine will be required to run the editor, so it wouldn't be practical to use a different language.<br><br>I don't have anything to share about the game yet, because it's just too far off completion and I don't want to do what others have done before and share information and beta's too early and have all interest in the finished game waning by the time I actually get close to finishing it.<br><br>Everyone I have dicussed it with thinks I'm entirely insane for taking on such a huge project on my own, and they're probably right. Most think it's far too big and destined to fail, and they're probably right too, so we'll just have to see.<br><br>EDIT: This isn't really about GUI programming, since it doesn't much relate to MaxGUI and it also related to using .Net DLL's in Max, but ok. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
