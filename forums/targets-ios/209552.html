The best you can do is to use core graphics to render a bitmap and display it, but I think there are serious issues on power drain if you did something like that.  I have found references on fps from a low of 8 to as much as 30fps, but animations are going to be a challenge.  The more I look at this the less likely I think we will ever see a Monkey X WatchKit target at least in the near term.  Back to xcode with swift and objective-c for now... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

And like you said, that probably stems from battery issues. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Get your WatchKit apps ready and submit them for review now.<br>Once your WatchKit app is approved and released by Apple, your existing iPhone users will receive the app update and customers will see your WatchKit extension icon and description on the App Store. A small group of people who currently have an Apple Watch will be able to use your WatchKit app before April 24, so make sure your back end systems are ready. If you prefer your WatchKit app to be available only after Apple Watch is available to all customers, set your release date to â€œmanual" and update it on April 24. <br><br><a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/watch/" target="_blank">https://developer.apple.com/app-store/watch/</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Monkey is a tool to generate games on several platforms, but the games themselves don't need to be completely portable.  The fact it does touch (iOS,Android) vs keyboard+mouse (PC,Mac,HTML5) vs joy/pad (PC,Mac,Xbox[?]) means some games do/don't work on different platforms.  And not all modules and features work on all platforms, and as designer/developer/programmer we make choices around the limitations. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
