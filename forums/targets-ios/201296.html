I would like to know if anyone here can shed a bit of light over the exact solutions to these things as I'm a newcomer in the iOS arena. <br><br>Since my problems are only two very little things I'm keeping both on the same post. Making two topics would be a waste of forum space.<br><br>My first issue relates to restrictions when it comes to textures.<br>In my tests iOS failed to load a 640x360 image. When resized to 640x320 the picture was read and displayed with no problem at all.<br>I had no problem loading the original 640x360 file under Android and HTML5 though. It definitely looks like a size restriction thing. Multiple of 32 pixels perhaps?<br><br>My second question is about timing. Is there any simple way of getting the time in milliseconds? I prefer to control sprite animations with time intervals rather than relying on frame count. Even Diddy's implementation is useless for that purpose as it has a resolution of 1 second only.<br><br>I would greatly appreciate any input on either of those issues. As I said before, I'm a complete noob when it comes to iOS.<br>Thanks. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I have had a 640x480 image loaded and displayed on the iPhone with no problems so I'm not sure why you couldn't see yours... maybe try making the filename all lowercase?<br><br>Millisecs() is what you are after I believe :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I blindly assumed that such function was not present in the API. When I started browsing the forums I saw a few suggested implementations made by users. Even the Diddy module provides such a function. I just assumed it didn't exist already.<br><br>Thanks again. The image-size mystery remains though. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
