Apple, Google and any web server company need away to contact you. And that usually means they need an email address and billing information. If they really want to talk to you; all it takes is a court warrant to get that information, and before any mention of Apple vs US Government over locked iPhones: that was Apple using the law to protect their IP.<br><br><div class="quote"> I really didn't want to know about the efficacy of emulation , I was referring Monkey Apps ability to be published/accepted by Apple , ie will Apple reject a monkey build because something is missing , legalities aside please because that is a great discussion for lawyers to have on a legal forum but I want to know about programming. <br></div>Your first post quoted below has no mention of  'would it be accepted if something is missing' and I told you in my first post one of the reasons why an application be it create with MonkeyX or natively in some other coding tool would be rejected. And yes, Apple and other Appstores will reject a build if something is missing, more so if its something that prevents them starting and testing the application. It should tell you in their terms and conditions for deployment; a legally binding document. And what you asked in the opening post comes under deployment and I gave you answer to that effect.<br><br>And just so you will know in future, at some point legalities always crops up in one form or another when writing and deploying software. If you don't like the advice and warnings; then go a head and release it and see what happens. It will either be rejected, or accepted and the chances are that its will be removed at a later time if accepted, and you may get contracted by the representatives of the IP; then you will soon find out about legalities depending how vicious the holder of the IP is at protecting it.<br><br><div class="quote"> <br>WILL APPLE EXCEPT AN EMULATED CONSOLE MONKEY GAME?<br><br>I have just setup monkey x and Monkey 2<br>I ported an older blitz max program to Monkey it took a couple of days, it's on my iPhone and Android phone already working without sound (soon)<br>Do emulated games get accepted by Apple ?

If you did and they actually responded; then they would more than likely want to know where you got hold of the ROM image. Even if you own the original ROM in it's original form and have made a copy as a backup is no guarantee from prosecution. The law on personal backup copies vary from country to country.<br><br><div class="quote"> This guy preaches about copyright laws on forums as "minuous1" and gets nasty when he thinks someone uses snippets from his pirated software, which he stole. He preaches very firmly "his copyright opinions" he believes if he publishes someone else's closed source project that it's legal because it's now open source" and of course he can distribute Roma so long as he follows "the rules" and have them in a seperate zip folder they are now legal downloads.<br><br>Do you see what I'm saying, if your not a qualified international copyright lawyer you are just presenting an opinion but these illegal sites are not closed down <br></div>So you are saying that what I have been trying to tell you is my opinion? Well here is <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/corp/legal.jsp" target="_blank">Nintendo's</a> opinion, and you cannot get more international than that with their legal team. Nintendo are known to seek out illegal distribution sites and where possible get them shut down with the occasional prosecution. There are also a number of other organisations such a Entertainment Software Association; this is a trade association which Nintendo, SONY and a number of other big software companies are apart of. They actually chase down those that pirate software, which is what the copying of a firmware ROM or software media really without is the IP's written consent no matter how old the software/ROM is. And as these companies tend to be in such organisations, so you can take it as read that they pretty much all sing from the same hymn book when it comes to enforcing copyright law. If you want to report copyright violations; then you contact these organisations as companies seldom respond to individuals. But even if the actually get these distribution sites shut down, it wouldn't stop such sites from popping up with illegal downloads else where, were there maybe no copyright treaties. And as for this minuous1, he is in for a very big shock when someone who he's been ripping off with some real financial clout see what he's doing and takes action. There is no such thing as open-source or freeware without the original author of the works giving their consent, this is usually done by a license supplied by the software. This is the thing that most people never bother to read that tells you what and what you cannot do with said distributed software.<br><br>And as for amigan.1emu.net; they are boarder-line with what they call Abandon-ware and as most of what they are serving appears obscure, the site has probably slipped under the radar of anyone checking for IP infringements. Abandon-ware is a term given to software where either the IP owner is no longer actively enforcing their rights, or who ever owns the IP is no longer clearly known. This doesn't mean that it can be legally distributed; there is nothing stopping the original owner of the IP from enforcing their rights again.  And unlike <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/" target="_blank">World of Spectrum</a>. The persons behind this site has not given any clear indication as whether or not they have made any attempt to contact the IP owners for permission to distribute such software.<br><br><div class="quote">  I'm a programmer no lawyer has advised me everyone has an opinion. <br></div><br>And if you still think that all of what I said is 'just my opinion' then you should have a serious talk to a legal adviser on such matters, just the same as I have in the past. They will basically say the same things that I have said. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Keep in mind though that Apple's App Store is more strict than Google's Play Store.<br><br>For iOS all apps must be compiled in 64bit, if using networking then it must support IPV6. They must also fully support suspend / resume. They can not use any private API's. Your app must not have a quit app option. Apple are also quite strict on emulators and there are no clear rules on what is accepted and what isn't. They are also very weary on content that may infringe on others copyright and are also keen to avoid a mass of multiple apps copying each other.<br><br>You may also find that your app gets initially refused but accepted on a second submit. So it's always worth submitting twice in a row and then dealing with any issues raised. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I listened to those that gave warnings and advice that had been through such situations themselves, checked up  (UK government web site has a dedicated section for information on Copyright/Trade Marks and patents) and spoke to those that have actually studied law and heeded what they had to say on such matters. I make it a priority to read any licence for software libraries that I wish to use for. If I don't fully understand it; then I seek legal advice. And I would never sign any contract that deals with copyrights or vast amounts of money without getting it first checked out by a lawyer, so that I don't end up getting screwed over.<br><br>Buy hey as Xaron says: "But just go on, do what you want to do, don't listen to us and make your own mistakes.
