A home version of it uses SQLite (since it records your time of response, successes, errors, for every game for every play) But the version i need to mod is for a University here in Mexico, they want to install it on a server and use the software with some kind of virtualization tool of Novel in their Local-Networked computers. So i'm forced to drop SQLite, in favor of a non-serverless SQL. I know little or nothing about LAMP (sorry bout the noob question, but this stands for Linux Apache MySQL PHP?), but i'll download them and give it a try :) But Now that Winni just scared me with the GPL licensing :O (BTW my proyect couldn't possibly exist if it werent for your modules, BIG thanks man... if i manage to sell copies of my software ill be sure to remember donating :) )<br><br>@Winni  You´re saying that if i use MySQL in my program, i have to opensource my app? Omg if that's true, then i can't use MySQL...Then i'll look into postgresql and oracle... i have 2 weeks left to make this so i'll better start studying <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

With this rule, I can static-link my own code and give it any license I choose.<br><br>If a library is GPL, unless there is a clause somewhere which allows runtime linking, your own code has to fall under the umbrella of the GPL.<br><br>As an example of this. Qt used to have a GPL license on Windows. This meant, unless you were using the commercial license variant of it, your code would have to be GPL'd too - even if you were only using the DLLs.<br>This is why they recently changed their license to be LGPL, because it is slightly more permissive, and is likely therefore to have wider adoption.<br><br>Anyway, if you peruse the many webpages and posts on the subject, you'll find there's much confusion on how to interpret the GPL.<br><br>The GPL is viral, and I try not to get involved with it if I can help myself.<br>I much prefer MIT/Apache/BSD style licenses, and occasionally LGPL if the library is easy to build (myself) for MinGW. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
