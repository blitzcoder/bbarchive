<table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr ><td class="posthead"><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr ><td >Brucey</td><td align="right"><font class=tiny>(Posted 2007)</font>&nbsp;<a href="#1">[#1]</a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr ><td class="posttext"> As some of the more observant <a href="/logs/userlog.php?user=8077&amp;log=1434" target="_blank">may have noticed</a>, I'm currently messing around with creating <b>another</b> GUI module for BlitzMax. (ie. a proper GUI, not graphics/canvas based).<br><br>Some facts :<br><br><b>It is based on wxWidgets</b><br><a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org" target="_blank">wxWidgets</a> is a GUI toolkit supporting all kinds of weird and wonderful controls/features.<br><br><b>It is cross-platform</b><br>Something I always look for with a BlitzMax module.<br>And with wxWidgets+BlitzMax it's cool to take an app you've built on Linux and see it running in the same way on Windows :-)<br>I have some issues with OS X currently, mostly to do with the way BlitzMax creates its own App menu - which interferes with wxWidget (probably trying to do the same thing!). I have a workaround, but I'm hoping that Mark might be able to think of a better way than my hack ;-)<br><br><b>It is not MaxGUI compatible</b><br>Rather than attempt to tie myself to the constraints of MaxGUI (its event model, limited gadgets, etc), I decided to do a straight port of wxWidgets to BlitzMax. Where there is a wxFrame class in wxWidgets, there's a wxFrame Type in BlitzMax, with as near to the same API access as I can make it.<br>The event model also works in the same way as wxWidgets. You Connect() a function to a specific event, and the function is called when the event occurs.<br><br><b>wxWidget library is huge!</b><br>Some of you might have problems with the "size" of it, but it's not really so bad. Unless you intended to use *every* feature of its API in one application, then you might have something to worry about.<br>There are TWO ways you can go when building an app that uses wxWidgets. The first is to have at hand the DLLs for the whole toolkit, and link to them at runtime. The second is to have a set of static libraries and link in only the functionality that you need for your application, without the need for external DLLs.<br>I have had it running with both options, but I currently use the static linking method. The auidemo app is currently around 3meg on Linux/Windows. Which isn't so big really. Certainly not the biggest binary I've ever seen.<br><br><b>Lots of modules!</b><br>Rather than building a single module which encompasses the whole API, I decided to split each functional part into its own module. This has lots of advantages. The primary one being that you only Import the parts you need, which therefore dramatically decreases the final binary size.<br>It also makes maintenance that much easier, because everything lives in its own place. To fix something on one control is a case of making a change to one module. Then a Build Modules recompiles/links that and any of its dependent modules - which is quick!<br>At this time there are around 60 modules, using the wx namespace.<br><br><br><br>I've done quite a lot so far, but there is still a rather large mountain of API to do. (no, really!).<br>I haven't yet touched on the wxGrid (which is a huge beast by itself - although it is very fully featured as a table/grid control !!)<br><br><br>I'm curious as to the interest of such a module.<br><br>If I was an entrepreneurial type I might consider selling the it for a small fee, but that would require an increased effort with regards support that I may not be able to give the time to.<br><br>So another option would be to create a repository on say, Google Code, and completely open it up to the community, and perhaps get some help in completing/maintaining it. (and while I mention it, would anyone be interested in helping get it done?)<br><br>There is also a wxScintilla widget around, which adds a scintilla text editor to the fray. If you haven't seen Scintilla, it's a *very* cool cross-platform editor control with folding, line-numbers, and all the usual things you really want in a code editor. Something like that, with the Aui framework could make for a really groovy BlitzMax IDE ;-)<br><br><br>Anyhoo... as usual, your comments and suggestions are always appreciated :-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You said it was partly to do with a conflict between Carbon (what wxWidgets uses) and Cocoa (what BlitzMax uses).

What platform?<br>I develop mostly on Linux, and do clean builds often (that is, all wx mods are stripped of binary data and recompiled). I then   build on Mac, and at work I have it building fine on my Win2k box.<br><br>If the instructions are not clear enough as to what you need, and what needs to go where, please tell me and I'll improve the guide.<br><br><div class="quote"> Can you distribute, the mod compiled? <br></div><br>Well, it's not finished yet, nor anywhere near it, which is why the instructions only point to the Subversion repository.<br>Consider it bleeding edge development ;-)<br>I do always try to have the repository code compiling without errors before I commit anything - so fingers crossed, it is always usable as I add more features.<br><br>Once much of the functionality is there, then I can start spending time packaging it up properly, but doing it now (and as often as I am committing), it would slow down my development cycle far too much.<br><br>Of course, if someone wants to provide pre-compiled sets, they are welcome to. (that is, excluding headers and libs).<br><br><br>Thanks Seb.<br>If you follow the wxMax Group, I've got the commits posting there too, which might give you an idea of recently added functionality.<br>The problem with porting up the samples, is that they tend to touch on all kinds of different functionality, rather than just the one thing (like the menu sample requires wxTextCtrl and logging to be working). So I bounce around adding bits here and there while working on a sample, and otherwise diving into a specific widget.<br><br>As for wxCocoa, I believe its functionality is too far behind/untested for me to be worrying about for the moment. I would much rather concentrate on getting the library working now, than spend time finding bugs in wxCocoa.<br>Still, if they can get it up to scratch, it would be nice to have.<br>Whether Cocoa is better or not, it depends what side of the camp you are in. For speed of coding (if one came from a C/C++ background) I imagine that Carbon is the best choice. If you were coding something from scratch, then sure, Cocoa might be the way forward.<br><br>Anyways, I'll stick with what works for now :-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The OOP is much better than the MaxGui one.<br><br>@Filax or @All:<br>I don't know if filax has solved the problem with big (full frame filling) button. The solution is very simple: <br>The wxFrame has a special feature, as long there is only 1 control parented to the frame this control is sized to the clientarea. There are 2 ways to solve this behaviour (which isn't bad). First add more than 1 control ;) , 2nd always use panels to as containers. Thats also the advantage of this behaviour, the panel is attached to the frame as its only child so the panel is resized everytime the frame is resized. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'm mapping the C++ classes one for one, which makes wrapping very much easier. The wxWidget's folks I feel have a pretty good design.<br><br><br>As for the control layout, there are things called Sizers you can use too, which allow you to design scalable positioning (not unlike what MaxGUI tries to emulate). And of course there is the traditional exact positioning option, but this can have problems when you move across platforms - those platforms having different HI guidelines to follow.<br><br>The chklist sample gives you a (small) idea of how the sizers work. Note that you don't give x,y or specific sizing of the controls. This way you don't need to worry about having to add 4 pixels to a button height when running your app on Mac, for example.<br><br>:o) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

multiple definition of `typeinfo....
</pre><br>usually means that the compiler you are using is not of the same version as the compiler used to compile the static library.<br>The current version in the Downloads section was compiled for BlitzMax 1.26 (MinGW 5.1.3). If you are still using 1.24, you can find the MinGW 3.1 compatible libs by choosing "Deprecated Downloads" in the combobox provided.<br>If you *are* on the latest BlitzMax, then you may need to copy over ar.exe and ld.exe from your MinGW/bin folder to your BlitzMax/bin folder. These are the archive/linker apps that are required for part of the compilation process.

(The ABI version difference as well as the number on the end of libstdc++.so imply this).<br>The static libs are also compiled with gcc4.<br><br>Do you have gcc3 and gcc4 installed?<br>I know that by default on Linux, BlitzMax wants to build using gcc3.3, but most systems these days ship with gcc4. It's pretty easy to make it build with gcc4 instead, and this may be what you need to do in order to go further.<br><br>However,<br><br>Perhaps adding this into wx.mod/wx.mod/common.bmx will fix the search order, and get around the attempted link to the system libs:<br><br>After ?Linux  add this line<br><pre class=code>

As long as when you change to using gcc4 from gcc3 you Rebuild All Modules, you'll be okay.<br>The reason there are problems with the two versions is that the GCC guys changed the internal vtables in gcc4 so that you can't link code from one to the other - for static-compiled apps, that is a Build-time issue. For Apps that used shared objects you need to have the compatible .so's on your system. (note that original warning about libstdc++) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
