But I don't like to login anylonger - just to see which old classmate of 25 years ago wants to get my "friend" - or whats friend of a friend wants to join the small group of my friends just to share months-old-viral-videos, pictures or game experiences... no thanks.<br>So my comment about "have to register" was more a general thing: it is like linking to a post in your board within a subforum requiring to be registered to enable reading.<br><br>This leads me to another aspect: discussion without registering : your "posts" on Facebook cannot get answered by guests.

I could get some off the shelf thing, but off the shelf software doesn't do a great job unless you customise it - and standardised software tends to get standardised hacks.  I fell into that trap years ago with phpbb and phpnuke and wordpress - they all have the same failings - it's easy to do a site that isn't worth having and then you get hacked....  So I'll do one, but first I must do the game.<br><br>Where facebook wins is I could quickly and easily create something, where there are potential customers already registered, and I dont have to work at maintaining it except to talk occasionally and try to engage my audience.  From a time management perspective it's ideal and suited my needs at that stage.<br><br>However it is limited, the reach isn't great and if anything users have slowly trickled away over the year instead of grown - to grow it I would have to promote it - doing so inside FB costs money, doing so outside of facebook, and that is where Facbeook fails - because of the facebook resistance....<br><br>So to me it had it's purpose and it had a place - but ultimately I am aware the game will need a site - and an FB presence will just be part of the online portfolio I will maintain during the active promotional period.<br><br>It needs a UI, some gameplay work and a bit more modelling done first. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
