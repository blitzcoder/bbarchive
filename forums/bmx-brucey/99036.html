The only thing I can recommend is to set all paths correctly in the env variables, I'm sure you have to move some files about, 3 files from one folder in MinGW to the MinGW/bin (Edit: All the .exe files in MinGW-&gt;libexec-&gt;gcc-&gt;mingw32-&gt;{version}/), also, if I recall, there's two files (Edit: ar.exe and ld.exe) you need to move from MinGW/bin to the BlitzMax/bin folder, and you may need to add some unicode dll (Edit: unicows.dll) to MinGW/bin (Or is it BlitzMax/bin)...<br><br>See, the whole thing is a mess!<br><br>EDIT: Untested mind, but, that may help!<br><br>Dabz<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
