Although I preselect the OpenGL button as the selected one with SetButtonState(render_opengl, True) the render_software radio button is being selected because it was created first. So when I get to my main loop checking out the EventSource() of EVENT_GADGETACTION it executes the code of the render_software radio button. Which changes the rendering mode in my configuration. After that it selects the render_opengl radio button, but it doesn't execute it's code.<br><br>So the application launcher is telling the user that OpenGL will be used (since it's selected), but it was actually told to use Software rendering.<br><br>I fixed this with calling SetButtonState render_software, False and SetButtonState render_opengl, False right after the buttons were created.<br><br>Wouldn't it be best if the GTK driver would behave like the other drivers?

I imagine I'll have to do something similar at some point.<br>...which means I'll need to track radio buttons for the parent in order to somehow disconnect the events, and reconnect them afterwards... oh Well :-p <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Yay!<br><br>Found a few more bugs to keep you busy...<br><br>&gt; Disabling menus doesn't appear to work.<br>&gt; Tabs don't look right for some reason (see IDE options). I think this is because of the way GTK handles tabs which is more automated than the MaxGUI API of hiding and showing your own panels. I think you tackled this problem by resizing the effective tab area to a thin strip that just contains the tabs, but Skid got around this in FLTK by creating a single client to which all tab children are added to, and then calling the FLTK <b>setParent()</b> method, reassigning the panel to the currently selected tab-widget. This seems to work quite well and this way, you get the full tabber widget drawn. <br>&gt; Child windows (windows with a group specified - the undocumented WINDOW_CHILD flag is obsolete now and is ignored by most of the MaxGUI drivers) aren't staying in front of parent windows.<br>&gt; The only way to keep the context menu open in the TextArea is to hold down the right mouse button. Clicking the right mouse button causes it to show but then hide again in quick succession.<br>&gt; <b>LookUpGuiFont()</b> - I think we're gonna have to get GTK to return more suitable fonts than the hardcoded presets, as the navbar and output fonts chosen just doesn't look write with the rest of the GTK themed controls. I'll have a mooch around the GTK docs tomorrow if I get a chance.<br><br>And finally, a minor point, but on my PC the GTK IDE seems to take quite a long time to start up, getting stuck at a particular point on the splash-screen compared with the FLTK IDE. I'm guessing its the population of the treeview, but I'll have a deeper look into this tomorrow. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I don't recall if this tweak felt like a sensible fix, or just a hack to get things going - you may want to check it out?<br><br>2) In finding issues with treeviews, I found slightly different behaviour between FreeTreeViewNode and FreeGadget, possibly solely because one had been over-ridden with locale functions, rather than a genuine difference.  You might want to check that both commands do the same thing.  (I think this was my bad, but noted just in case useful!)<br><br>3) In treeviews, I did find and fix some CE IDE code that was calling nodes after they had been freed.  Although I agree this shouldn't just be ignored, it also didn't fail very nicely on linux.  The root cause was iter=Null inside the populatelistrow generating errors when calling gtk_tree_store_set_value.  I suggest adding a Debug.Assert iter&lt;&gt;Null...and / or maybe consider ensuring same across other platforms?  This may have been related to 2.<br><br>4) I was at times getting gtk critical errors on SetGadgetShape on a panel.  This was intermittent, and by this stage vastly obscured by the accellerator keys issue, and it was at this point I gave up before.<br><br>Firing up the linux beast now... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
