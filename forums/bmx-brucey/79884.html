</textarea><br><br>At first glance wxWidget's sizers can be very confusing, but they are a snap when you use wxFormBuilder (no sizers in the example above).<br><br><div class="quote"> I understand that wxMax has much more to offer, but what if I don't need all the extra gadgets etc? Is it overkill, and more complicated? <br></div>No, its a very straight-forward design. You wont have a bunch of overhead if your not using all the features. In the example you can see that when we need a feature we simply Import it. So, for example, if you don't need a button on your frame you just don't Import it.<br><br><div class="quote"> I know many people complain about Blitz's take on GUIs (b+ and now maxgui) but I've always enjoyed using them and not really been that troubled by what is missing. <br></div>Some applications just need more features ;)<br>MaxGUI isn't all that bad, the event handling is just fine, unless your writing a huge application, in which case its a pain in the arse. I mainly came here because everything WORKS cross-platform, and because it actually has a good form designer.<br><br><div class="quote"> Does wxMax support any form designer? or XML layout format? <br></div>Both, <a href="/posts.php?topic=79750" target="_blank">XRC</a> and <a href="http://wxformbuilder.org/" target="_blank">wxFormBuilder</a>, wxCodeGen (specific to wxMax) can turn a wxFormBuilder project into code.<br><br>Overall, I'd say wxMax and MaxGUI are geared towards different type of people. For the people that need tons of crazy features and prefer object oriented programming wxMax is the one, for people who are just playing around on Windows or Mac (arhh FLTK is evil) or those who prefer the classic blitz-style programming MaxGUI will do. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Any caveats? <br></div><br>The only caveat I know of, is troublesome fullscreen graphics context handling - I've had difficulty with input (key/mouse) event capture once you go fullscreen. Graphics Context in a window works well though.<br><br>But wxWidgets is aimed more for applications than games, and not many apps need to go fullscreen graphics, as far as I know.<br><br>MiniB3D runs fine using a wxGLCanvas - which is just a GL context (there are some examples around the forum and in the samples of doing GL things in wxMax).<br><br>Blitz3Dsdk is different though. I did a proof of concept a long time ago, and it was drawing in the window, but at the time there were event issues with the SDK - I'm not sure if those were fixed *in* the SDK though - I don't have it.<br>You can access the HWND of a window/panel via a method call, which I believe is enough to attach an SDK context to. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

For example, a wxFrame extends a wxTopLevelWindow extends a wxWindow etc... It's all pretty logical.<br><br>The event system in wxMax is very much more under *your* control. You "Connect" a callback function to a particular event, and wait for the system to call it. There's no need for long Select/Case or If/Then/Else statements. You will instead end up with a group of functions which you will generally give useful names to - OnClick, OnListItemSelect, etc.<br><br>Yes, wxMax is much larger... so at first you might feel a bit lost with the amount of functionality  at your disposal. But of course, that is a big advantage, since you have all that at your finger tips. There are a few large sample apps, as well as a comprehensive tutorial to help you get to grips with it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The app also shows how to use the localization, drag-and-drop, file-config support, and other wxMax functionality :-)<br><br>wxWidgets can utilize an XML layout format called XRC. I'm currently integrating this into wxMax. There are some samples available that show it working. It's actually an excellent thing I've found, since you simply don't need half the code you would normally use to create an application - only code to implement event handling and the likes. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
