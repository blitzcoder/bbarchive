One part which caught my eye is that the docs say you shouldn't try to recode paint event handlers of standard widgets.

Shapes and fills (especially bitmaps and gradients) combined with regions ought to get me far.<br><br>Widgets like tree and grid seem flexible enough as to not requiring coding of my own custom widgets for their use. On the other hand wxHTMLListBox seems to be missing from wxMax.<br><br>What I didn't yet get fully is how to use things like events and items with your own custom widgets, but as that stuff is covered by the docs I expect to get actually coding things pretty soon.

Judging how some wx widgets repaint themselves only partially (like for example slider) I guess wx simply isn't designed for use where there's any kind of background other than single solid color.

So instead of making for example a round button widget, I would make a function that draws a round widget on a passed DC and returns some dimension information for internal event handling (mouse clicks etc). A "super widget" would then handle all the drawing and event handling internally.
