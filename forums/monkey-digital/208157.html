Flash is still widely used (youtube, facebook) and still getting active updates which is keeping it relevant.

I have not found since the inititial release of html5 a single fully-playable game for mobile, one that was near interesting, and the fact almost none of them are set to have mobile full screen support, why even bother?  <br><br>I try playing something and if I accidentally tap and drag outside the canvas area and the webpage scrolls, with all these issues I'm certain a lot of people can agree why flash isn't dying all that quickly. The death of flash will require a boatload of Html5 games that aren't shit and that can be reasonably played on a mobile device, and that's IF it even happens.<br><br>There are a lot of great flash games that took years to make.

To me reading comments like this says that you don't know that there's still a number of people who aren't interested in everything mobile. A lot of acquaintances I know would rather use Laptops than Tablets and these aren't tech savvy nor tech ignorant people. Also, what TKG said. HTML5 runs at about 2 FPS on mobile devices. That's absolutely true for the PS Vita at least and it's supposed to be a gaming system.<br><br>----<br>Aside from the points I made before, ActionScript is also a way to obfuscate code from being reverse engineered easily. With JavaScript you can pack it...but the unpacker side is everywhere on the net. Trying to obfuscate JavaScript is horribly difficult. This is also a negative for HTML5 as a viable platform. People will get edgy about people being able to steal their code and resources too easily. I genuinely never saw HTML5 as a strong commercial platform. I'm assuming others here strongly disagree with me, but we'll see right? All in time we'll see who was predicting it correctly because as far as I'm concerned we'll all disagreeing about currently unprovable hypothesize. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I just read that Flash as a whole was dying and disagreed. A sector of its market dying is inevitable as new markets arise from the digital age. However, even with that said, while Flash games may be taking a hit, I don't think it'll just up and die with the loss of one advertiser/publisher. Then again, who knows. It hasn't actually happened yet. I'm awaiting several flash portal sites to suddenly take leave since they will apparently no longer have any games.<br><br><div class="quote"> You may not have heard of Mochi Media before, but if you have played *any* flash game with an Ad - you bet that was Mochi. <br></div><br>I felt like I had to quote this to mention that I don't play these kinds of games. In fact, I barely play games at all. People around me find it kind of strange that I enjoy making games but am not huge on playing them.<br><br><div class="quote"> HTML5 isn't yet capable of half of what Flash could achieve. <br></div><br>Uh huh. Live streaming is the next thing HTML needs. Twitch TV for instance couldn't just live on HTML5 video. Then standards on what type of music files the browsers can use (they've been at war on this one). Etc, etc, etc. The committee/organization behind the web standards is notoriously slow. They like to get input from Apple, Mozilla, Google, and Microsoft, who all generally have vastly different ideas on what should go next. For an idea on what I mean, lookup the Dart language and then those company's response to it. This is what you get when large egos clash.<br><br><div class="quote"> Pascal is still taught at several places, that doesn't mean it's "alive and well" =/ <br></div><br>Coincidentally Pascal was removed as a class from the local school in 2012 for being outdated. With regards to Flash as a whole, it's being used to animate all sorts of indie cartoons on the net. It's not dead as an animation tool. Although that is another market that could be corned by something else that's better in time. When that happens then the only thing Flash will have left is live streaming, music, videos. In short: media. Flash will just be a tool for media on web browsers since W3C can't get their stuff together.<br><br>And now I'm going to sleep as I feel my writing is drifting off-topic a bit too much even for me. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
