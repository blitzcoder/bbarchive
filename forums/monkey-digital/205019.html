I recall several years back (around 2005-ish when 3D engines were all the rage), i got into a huge flame war on their forum regarding what 3D engine can build a "professional" game and what can't. Obviously, the folks at TV3D felt that their engine was a true professional engine since it supported professional languages such C++, C#...etc..etc. I argued that any 3D engine (blitz3d, darkbasic3d, 3DGS, 3DRAD) can be used to make "professional" games as the end result is what matters as the gamers could care less how you made it, just as long as the game is great. But to my surprise, no one there was having it and even the mods stepped in (and sided with them of course) to shut down the thread with the final statement along the lines of : "TV3D is a professional engine, all the others are just toys.." <br><br>Wow..nuff said :). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
