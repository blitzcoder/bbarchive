Blitz itself (IIRC) produced Gloom, a smoother-moving and perfectly-playable Wolfenstein clone.<br><br>I have always said, though, that it was the combination of Windows 95 and DOOM that killed the Amiga.  Windows finally caught up with pre-emptive multi-tasking [and while one program on Win95 could easily crash the whole system, the hard fact is that the Amiga with zero memory protection was worse], and there was a hit game that the Amiga could not reasonably represent.  Even though the Miggy played arcade-style games more smoothly, it had lost its USPs and it started to be seen as limited. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I made a couple of Amiga shareware games with Blitz (so much nicer for my programming style than AMOS which I started on), but the market wasn't there then.  I had more success later on the PC, though for that I moved to C++.  Now I'm stuck again in this tacky new market ;)<br><br>I loved Rainbow Islands (came free with my 500).  Other favorites: Might and Magic 2 (breath of fresh air after the slightly po-faced BT series); Dungeon Master; Civilisation (loved the little animation of a spherical Earth with dinosaurs etc. while it was generating a world); Sim Life.<br><br>Not sure how fast RAM would have helped that much.  The CPU was slow anyway, and IMO fast RAM would have given a max increase of about 2x speed while interfering with the Blitter and other hardware.  At least that's how I always thought of it, though I am not a hardware guy.  My impression was that the Amiga benefited from the fact that you didn't have to care about caches etc. - the RAM speed and CPU speed were close enough that you had a fairly 'flat' model with the whole of the system open to you.  It was only when the x86 powered ahead towards 100 MHz or so that it was clear that that architecture was ultimately superior.  But like I say, not a hardware guy so feel free to tell me I'm all out to lunch on the foregoing! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
