Giving a game away is no more moral than some person spending $50 a day on a game. People can choose to do what they want to do and as long as you are not forcing people do to something with physical threat to their body then good/bad has nothing to do with it.<br><br>When you put qualifiers ahead of your statements on what you think should or should not be a way to make money you are only limiting what opportunities you have available. If you make the game free and everything in the game easy to get you do not have a game easy to monetize. Even if you have the game free and things very difficult to get (time consuming) you will never monetize as well as if you have a free game plus things which can only be gained through payment (the best options of which are ones where gameplay is allowed to happen in unique ways other than the primary method of play). There is more than one way to define "progress" and many people play the same game for different reasons and in different ways than others, even ways a developer had not intended possible.<br><br>Another thing to watch out for is when you set yourself as an example on spending money. If you look only at your own play and spending habits then you miss out on understanding everyone else in the world. As game makers we are already in the scare minority of consumers. If you do not spend money in games routinely, if you do not buy many major games, if your spending and play habits do not follow then trends of the majority out there then watch you! You could be on the path to making things only you want to play.<br><br>As game devs many of us have strong opinions, but the reality is many people on the outside are happy to pay for power (P2W) and are fine with investing money into what they see as a hobby - their current favorite game. They show it with their actions - even when some minority on forums say they "hate p2w games" the numbers speak for themselves. It's either selection bias in the forum population, or they are all liars who are only saying they hate something to save face, meanwhile having fun with more power in game.<br><br>When people say others are falling for "coercive and manipulative" methods what they are really doing is objectifying those people by refusing them agency to making their own choices. They are assuming they are children because they are choosing to do things they, the obviously smarter person, would never do.<br><br>If you want to win then follow the data. Have some guts and try things which other people are hating on. If you are making more money, then invest that money into dream projects you've been wanting to make, which without money were impractical.<br><br>If you want to be the nice guy and not allow people to spend money, not optimize your game to be both fun and make unlimited money, and not make money that's up to you, but don't expect people to reward you for being so generous. Zynga makes more money than any of us here, because they are viciously analytical with optimizing making money. It works - they make lots of money. Their strateies may not work forever in their current form, but the methods still work for others in mutated forms. I don't really like the games purely based on optimizing money making, because I think they lack at least some heart, but the people who own those properties are still making more money than the rest of us, and keeping the attention of a major majority of the market.<br><br>For the record, games like LoL or Dota 2 I like how they monetize, but I bet that LoL will forever make more money as they sell methods of differing play (indirectly) with their character sales, while Dota 2 gives everything for free, and only sells cosmetics.<br><br>There are a lot of things about the article which make me cringe. The assumption that only children would like cartoon graphics. If a child is spending money that is not theirs to spend then it is a failure of parenting. A child can take a parent's credit card and spend money on anything if they know how, but children never spend money on things "targeted at adults", right? Call of Duty games, with their attempts at high realism, only sell to people over the age of 25, right? The assumption that people cannot spend real $ on a premium currency with judgement - hey, when someone buys a bag of candy and they trade those for a sugar high are they no longer able to judge the value of that transaction as they consume the candy? Probably not. It's the same with any consumable, but you would think people would be able to make a value judgement on the original transaction. Also, ban everyone under the age of 25 from being able to spend money, because they are purely incapable of decision making, and also ban the majority of people who spend money on luxury items... I'm not even going to say which demographic that is, but it's not people under 25. Finally - his appeal to only make games of skill - not everyone wants to play all games in the same way - stop trying to influence others so that they only have limited experiences available in the way you personally approve of. Please see the "I'm better than all of you and would never make a F2P game" crowd for what they really are - a similar crowd to those who blame school shootings on violent video games.<br><br>Final thoughts: Not everyone is going to buy the cheapest toilet paper just because they are cheap - some people are willing to pay a premium for the greater experience, even if functionally they don't need to spend as much to gain the same ultimate value. Some will spend $1,000 on a pair of pants they only wear once, while others will only ever buy their clothing second hand. People do what they want. They are not as endlessly manipulable as some think. To think people are stupid because they do not value the same things you do makes you the really ignorant one who does not understand that different people have different value systems. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Those who refuse to adapt to the changing market will lose. There will still be exceptions, but already we can see the shift with ALL top grossing games consistently being F2P for most of the time, and the devs who do make F2P but make cosmetic only options not being as able to compete (there are of course exceptions, but I've seen stats from comparable games and the ones which do the things people hate on (paying for game related stuff) make more money more often), while devs who have paid gates on features or content are winning.<br><br>What about this: you can download an app and pay some money instead to unlock everything in it. Is that morally reprehensible? How exactly is that different from Candy Crush?

If you wall yourself from opportunity on emotions you are only hurting yourself. At least keep an open mind for the good opportunities available. There was a dev a while who refused to listen to reason. He didn't want to make a F2P game, but he also didn't want to make an outright upsell screen. So, as to avoid looking like a scumbag (in his mind), he hid a buy screen deeply in his menus. The result? With many downloads he made almost nothing. That's what happens when you make decisions in appeals to how others work up your emotions.<br><br>I would like to see many more Monkey devs being very successful.

Candy Crush is designed to be an endless game, and its design is to be ever increasingly difficult. No one is forcing people to play it. There are tons of full purchase match 3 games available. It is peoples' choice, for whatever their reasons are, to keep playing that game, and in some cases pay to have an advantage. That advantage is value to people - they want it - they like it. That you do not understand that value does not mean it doesn't exist to them. Do you buy top of the line luxury clothing?

They are choosing to do it. If you deny someone has the agency to make the choices they want then you are objectifying them as not a person. Just because their personal choices do not line up with your personal ideals of what you would choose does not mean they are being forced against their will to make their choice.<br><br>&gt;I am starting to wonder if either your simply not understanding my point of view or were just getting our wires crossed.<br><br>It must be that my English is not clear enough. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That specially true for the Android market. I've tried that lite/full thing a lot in the past and there might be games out there where this would fit better than the f2p model. More complex games are in that lite/full category I guess.<br><br>Starting a match-3 game today and make it a paid game you won't see any money at all. You have to make it free and use ads or make it f2p... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Look, I added simple admob banners into my games which don't annoy anyone today and they do pretty well. Make about $200-$300 per month with my sea battle game for iOS and Android (lite versions) which have about 100 downloads per day each which is not thaaat much.<br><br>I can imagine that a game with 1000 downloads a day which is really played and fun can make some nice money with admob banners alone.<br><br>I never understood why someone should give a game away for free as I always had the impression that banner ads simply don't work but they actually do! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Look at the top grossing games on each platform. They all make bank.<br><br>The thing is they spend countless thousands every day on maintaining their dominance. But if you can make $2 for every $1 you spend you'll be spending those $1s as quickly as you can.<br><br>For us, we are keeping a balance between F2P and Premium games. I like when games are not F2P as a game, but I won't deny that they make money and are worth doing if you can do them right, which is in itself tricky with no guarantees. Some product types simply do not work as F2P. In all cases with my own projects, I want to always try to make things which fail gracefully and are still mostly if not completely playable without an Internet connection, but even that in does not work with specific designs of great potential.<br><br>I also have ZERO problem with Pay 2 Win games and I don't have any sympathy for people who complain about these games. They are wasting their time, and some people like paying for power, so it boils down to "stop liking what I don't like" endlessly. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
