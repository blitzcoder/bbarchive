Unity allows this in a much faster cycle than Monkey. If Monkey had a live editor, this would accelerate things and put Monkey on par to allow that fast iterative cycle. (side note: this is why i've been looking at a monkey extension for Brackets)<br><br>My other thought is creating better pipelines for the assets. An example would be that I am working on using Blender as a level editor for miniB3D. so if Monkey can somehow leverage existing software that does the level design and asset creation, then proper importing and exporting allows faster iterations as well.<br><br>I mean, Unity is basically a level editor, is it not? at some point you need to code the game.

The Unity player runtime for iOS is about 13mb without the pro stripping capability.  I think the Unity splash could become an asset, however, if it only appears on bloated slow to download and slow to start up apps it could come back to bite.  In other words, seeing the Unity splash screen could be a red flag saying, "warning, incoming bloated software delete immediately :)".<br><br>Consumers are quick to figure these things out, for example AIR apps for iOS and Google tend to get negative reviews if they are determined to be AIR apps, I would think the same thing would happen with Unity games deployed with the free version.  Also, for 3G iOS downloads I think there is a cap at 20mb, otherwise the app has to be downloaded via wifi.<br><br>At the end of the day, Unity needs to make money so there shouldn't be a problem paying the license fees for the pro version.  The problem is during development, it would be nice to have access to develop with all the pro features and only be restricted for deployment.

Everything about Unity can be spun as a pro or a con. <br><br> * Feature-rich - Overly complicated/bloated<br> * Consistent framework - Constricted development<br> * Unity Player improves cross-platform standardisation - People don't like plugins / increased download size.<br><br> On the same theme a big draw for me is that C#/JS and Unity itself are recognised and saleable skills. If programming is your career then it's hard to ignore the fact that Monkey/Haxe/Lua based cross-platform engine experience isn't going to shine as much on a CV or present the same level of contract opportunities. On the other hand if you're not a coder (or, I guess if you are but happy just doing games as a hobby) then that's irrelevant or a negative if you don't like C#/JS.<br><br> What I would argue is that people shouldn't just ignore the likes of Unity out of Monkey loyalty or because it's editor-centric rather than code-centric. There are some great ideas at the language, framework and editor levels that could be brought over. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
