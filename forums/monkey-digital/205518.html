Handling moving/falling tiles whilst allowing the player constant freedom to play further moves - even while a lot of the board is moving, is a complete nightmare.<br><br>Anyway, that said - Candy Crush Saga has had tons of marketing - even to the extent of running TV ads in the UK (seriously, they do).  However much money they're making from it, is only because they've already spent £millions promoting it.  It is advertised everywhere, there is barely a day goes by where I don't see it advertised some place or other. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

One of the hardest things I had to overcome was keeping the gameplay flowing , it all depends on how you set things up and it can and should influence your design from the start.<br><br>I think the best route to take is to ignore the art, design the game with basic art so that there is no real theme just work on making it work, making it flow and try and avoid blocks to the gameplay, nothing worse than forcing a player to sit and wait for all the tiles to stop before they can move again, I would also avoid covering the whole screen with FX, people like to scan the board all the time and if you cover it with particles they get in the way of that, so keep your FX quick and clean...<br><br><br>Once you have a descent working game, coming up with the art and style and theme is a walk in the park, you can even theme the game more than once and sell them as different games, some people might like their match 3 games to look like a cartoon while others might like games that look real, a simple Ruskin lets you target those different audiences while not requiring a recode.<br><br>This is a lot of the same stuff I had in mind when making mine and its the same things I will be doing when it comes time for me to port my old match 3 into monkey.<br><br>Hope it helps. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I was (and actually still am) very excited about it and even game reviewers gave some very good reviews: <a href="http://www.theiphoneappreview.com/2012/01/blotty-pots-iphone-app-review/" target="_blank">http://www.theiphoneappreview.com/2012/01/blotty-pots-iphone-app-review/</a><br><br><i>When it comes to games for iOS, it often feels like there just arent any more roads to run: As if everything has already been done, and everything since that hypothetical point has been re-runs and rehashes. However, its games like Blotty Pots, by developer Cobblecrowd, that restore our faith in the platform, bringing along innovative gameplay with a simplistic twist.</i><br><br>So well, the results in terms of downloads were devastating, even the free lite version! The main problem obviously was (beside the name) the fact, that users simply don't find it because it's hard to describe what to look for!<br><br>After that I thought by myself, well why not copy something which already exists. So I did BattleShip an hell, it did sky rocket compared to my first one. In 2012 alone it made about $10,000 in revenue for the paid version. Even though it's not that much I consider this already a success.<br><br>You don't have to invent anything new and unique.

(Doing this before and after a swap is attempted, as well as while pieces are falling and players are still playing)<br><br>- Animating the various touches, moves and tile removals<br><br>- Animating the dropping of blocks so that you can keep playing while they drop.<br><br>- Handling tiles being removed while others are already dropping, re-adjusting where the dropping tiles go if some are removed below it in the process.<br><br>- Constantly making sure that there are no un-found matches while the action is happening.<br><br>- Implementing the various game styles, from "endless/classic" to "timed" or "leveling" modes.<br><br>- Making cool graphics :)<br><br>EDIT:<br><br>- AI needs to look over the initial board for matches, and have at least 1 match (depending on your AI)<br><br>- Touch events.  What do you do when they slide their finger?  Slide it over an animating tile?  Lift up the finger? etc.  Coordinating any touch or click events and what the user expects the behavior to be can be a challenge as well.<br><br>EDIT 2:<br><br>- Tying in animations around multiple moves happening at the same time.<br><br>- Adding the effects of bonus or special tiles on the overall board.<br><br>- The glitter - like particle effects when tiles go away, or bonus effects, or just displaying the score when you get a piece.<br><br>===================================<br><br>And there are many more that I'm not thinking of right now.<br><br>So, if you're interested in a pretty fun programming puzzle, match-3 is definitely a good one to go after.

In the classic match-3-scheme you just combine 3 and they collapse, you combine 4 and you get some "special" jewel, combine 5 and you get something more special and so on.<br><br>An idea would be to differ from that. So 3 jewels together won't collapse immediately. If you add a fourth one it starts to "react" a bit (shown as pulsating), if you add a fifth and more it starts to become instable. So it's more a matter of time. The more jewels of the same kind are together the more unstable this block becomes till it collapses by itself. You can always collapse a block by tipping on it (like in Diamond Dash or Collapse). So the goal would be to combine as much of the same jewels as possible until they collapse due to their mass. It's more like a nuclear reaction where you just add and add till you get the critical mass. Don't know if that is clear? I mean that way you have some "time pressure" to build up large blocks. Look, 3 jewels together would be stable, 4 would take for instance 8 seconds to collapse, 5 jewels 6 seconds, 6 jewels 4 seconds and so on.

It seems to be a really common problem here, I wonder why that is.  But then you are the expert on reskins so I have to defer to your game development expertise.<br><br>Come on.  You've put out a few extremely substandard, lackluster rehashes of games that have been around for decades, in two cases before computers were even developed.  You're selling Solitaire-- not one but two versions of the same game, reskinned-- and you're accusing me of being a crook for putting out clones?  Remember, I'm not actually doing it.  You are.  Perhaps a bit of projection going on there.<br><br>How much time did you put into that?  Oh, so it's got a crime theme.  That must have taken you a great deal of design effort.  It really shows in the end product!<br><br>Remember, I didn't say I was going to do that.  I said if I did do what you were doing, that is what I would do.  I would outsource the art and music (but to halfway competent creatives) and I would modularize the "big differences" in gameplay as much as possible.<br><br>You're the one actually doing it.  Your entire impressive catalog is reskins of games that someone else thought of. Games that have been repackaged and resold literally thousands of times.  How's that working out for you? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I mean consider a collapse type game where you collapse blocks of equal colors on a quadratic field. Now you can rotate your device (from portrait to landscape) and all blocks just react to this new gravity location and fall down to the new "bottom" which was the side before. How would you like that? Could it be fun to include device rotation as another "input"? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
