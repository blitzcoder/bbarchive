I provided the palette, image sizes, rough sketches and descriptions, and number of animation frames needed. I paid $170 for the graphics work I contracted out.<br><br>Outsourcing a lot of the graphics is another reason I stayed out of the jam. I just wanted to make a decent Halloween game and knew I needed to contract out a good amount of the graphics in order to complete it in time for Halloween.<br><br>However, this game was really just the start of the full game I envision. Next year I will revisit it and scale it up adding multiple stages, probably a boss battle and other stuff. I wouldn't invest in the graphics for just a 2-week "throw-away" game. lol<br><br>For me it is entirely reasonable because (a) as someone who is much more of a programmer than an artist art takes me a long time to get right and (b) games need so much art trying to do it all myself would add a lot of time to any project I am doing.<br><br>It probably would have easily taken me a week to complete the graphics I contracted out. When you're doing this stuff part-time gotta maximize the amount getting done as much as possible.<br><br>For my current Christmas game project I am doing the same thing. I have 3 artists working on this project. This time I am targeting Sega Genesis/Megadrive graphics quality. I just started this project about 2 weeks ago and so far have paid $310 for graphics work.<br><br>I have 3 more artists on standby just in case I need to outsource more work in order to get this game done in time for Christmas. Honestly, I just get tired of all of the graphics work. I have enough to do with the game design, programming, sound FX, music and so forth. lol<br><br>Again though, this is the first in a series of Christmas games I plan to make. Each Christmas I will revisit this and build it out more. So I'm basically building a bigger game than what anyone will see until maybe 2 or 3 years down the road. Just taking it in 6-week sprints each year. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It is very frustrating when you need graphics for your games and just don't have the time to put into doing it and also don't have the money to put into it.<br><br>I've been in that situation. And also in the situation where although having money to invest I could not find any artists.<br><br>Fortunately, the situation has changed dramatically the past few years. It is one of the few good things about so many people pouring into game dev trying to strike gold. There are now a huge number of these artists seeking to make money by taking on contract art work for games. Because there are so many of them the prices (just like games) have dropped down considerably to where it is now affordable.<br><br>Take a look around out there and you will find many artists looking for work. And a lot of them will say right in their ads CHEAP! Of course, cheap, affordable and low-cost are all subjective terms. I get that. Still it may be worthwhile to have a look around.<br><br>What I do is look for artists who would be spending their time just drawing for fun. People who just love making game art. For those people, if you're already spending hours per day just drawing for fun actually being paid to do it is like a dream come true.<br><br>I also still do a good amount of my own graphics work. Like in my Halloween game the graphics for the text LIGHT THE FIRES &amp; STAY ALERT!, all of the graphics for the status bar, the big tree, the shadow tree backdrop, spiderweb line, the orbs of dark energy released by killing enemies are all things I made from scratch. Like I said, there is just so much graphics work needed for games. I contract out some (these days most) and do some myself.<br><br>Everyone can make some decent graphics and I just posted this same kind of thing over in the GLBasic forums a couple weeks or so ago.<br>Here is a paraphrased version of that post:<br><br>--------------------------------<br>Every programmer can draw much better than they think they can.<br><br>The biggest reason most cannot draw very well that I have seen is because they don't use reference images. And yet every artist I know does use reference images. Many references in fact.<br><br>If I needed to create some images for a car for a driving game I'd literally get up in the back of my pickup and take photos of my car. Then turn the wheel in the car and angle the car and repeat. With those as reference images I could then draw a car in the view needed. Or get a matchbox car or RC car. Put it in the viewpoint I need and use that as a reference to draw it. Alternately, just go online and get screenshots of games that have the kind of things you need in your games. Use those as your reference. But not just sit there and start drawing with no reference at all trying to just pull it out of my head.<br><br>The second biggest difference I've seen between artists and programmers is the amount of time they spend on an image. I've done a lot of programmer art. And worked with several artists on projects. I'll draw a tile in 2 minutes or a character in 10 minutes. They'll draw a tile in 5 to 15 minutes and a character in 30 minutes to hours. One artist I know who does fantastic work told me he can easily spend up to 1 hour just on the arm of a single animated character sprite. The entire character may take a full day's worth of effort.<br><br>I don't and can't possibly spend that kind of time on my graphics work. I also tell the artists I hire to do it in as quick n easy of a way as possible for them. Because any good artist will still produce good quality graphics and I don't want their work for me to be some burden laboring for hours for low pay. But still artists spend far more time on their artwork than programmers do from what I have seen. And they have also spent far more time creating artwork than programmers have. Literally thousands or tens of thousands of hours. Many have been drawing their entire lives.<br><br>So.... use references and take your time! You'll probably find you can make much better game graphics than you think you can!<br>-------------------------------- <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
