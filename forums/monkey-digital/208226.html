When it came to the punitive damages, the jury found that McDonald's had engaged in willful, reckless, malicious, or wanton conduct, and rendered a punitive damage award of 2.7 million dollars. (The equivalent of just two days of coffee sales, McDonalds Corporation generates revenues in excess of 1.3 million dollars daily from the sale of its coffee, selling 1 billion cups each year.)<br><br>McFact No. 7: On appeal, a judge lowered the award to $480,000, a fact not widely publicized in the media. <br><br>McFact No. 8: A report in Liability Week, September 29, 1997, indicated that Kathleen Gilliam, 73, suffered first degree burns when a cup of coffee spilled onto her lap. Reports also indicate that McDonald's consistently keeps its coffee at 185 degrees, still approximately 20 degrees hotter than at other restaurants. Third degree burns occur at this temperature in just two to seven seconds, requiring skin grafting, debridement and whirlpool treatments that cost tens of thousands of dollars and result in permanent disfigurement, extreme pain and disability to the victims for many months, and in some cases, years. <br></div><br><br>&gt;Kickstarter is not a buying-selling service<br><br>In part it is, another part is just paying money people without expecting anything in return. There is no expectation that people who give money have a stake in the company, that they own anything not being sold to them explicitly, that they deserve compensation that the company they supported sold out. <br><br>This event may make people think twice about supporting companies on KS. Many companies which are good at marketing as the cool people will sell out given a good price, and even more than 1B is crazy money.<br><br>There will be more VR companies. OR doesn't have a monopoly. Facebook buying OR may make other investors fund new competitors, which will be good for devs and gamers alike. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
