The card game can have a few players and one dealer.<br><br>I started writing down all the attributes I foresee the Player class and Dealer class having. I noticed both classes have some of the same attributes so I put those attributes under a Person class expecting Player and Dealer would inherit from it. I then noticed all of Person class attributes were the same as the Dealer class attributes with no additional attributes.  So I scratched the Person class and decided Player could inherit from Dealer. However, a Player IS NOT A Dealer in my card game. (NOTE: I have not considered the behavior in each class but lets assume the Player class will have all the behavior the Dealer class has plus more.)<br><br>Should a class extend another class because it has the same attributes and behavior?

And the only design pattern I know at the moment is Singleton taken from Mike Hartlefs book, "Monkey Game Development Beginners Guide".<br><br>muddy_shoes, your two points are valid...<br>1) If Player class extends Dealer class then from an OO perspective a player "IS A" dealer but in my card game a player should never deal. So I take it, Player class should not extend Dealer.<br>2) It's likely Dealer will have some behavior that Player does not, such as a DealCards method. So again Player class should not extend Dealer.<br><br>Do I go back to using a Person class having attributes and behavior that Player and Dealer have in common?

There's really no one answer to this question. Also, as you've not mentioned the nature of the card game, we can't really offer precise feedback.<br><br>If a player can't deal then clearly they shouldn't extend Dealer. If a Dealer can play then maybe they could extend Player. Equally, you could just have an abstract concept of a GameParticipant as c.k. mentions but not inherit from it at all, rather provide it with a behavioural Role. It all depends on the nature of the game, and your needs in terms of flexibility/extensibility. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But that would follow my general approach to card or board games in which any player can in principle be a human or an AI.  If the dealer is always the computer, you have not much reason to make them the same as they may not have much in common except a bankroll and one or two functions.  You might even consider making the dealer a function of the class that controls the game (and deals?) and arbitrates the legality of moves.<br><br>There is never any perfect OO design - if you can't choose between two they are probably either both okay, or both too detailed.  <br><br>I find all that "is a - has a" stuff to be a bit too abstract as a criterion.  I prefer to think about what will keep my data coherent and encapsulated, and put groups of related functions in one place. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
