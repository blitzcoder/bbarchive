I thought I'd drop in and meet some people and see what it's all about - I've been to conferences in other business areas, but never casual games.<br><br>Anyone else going there and want to have a chat about the relative greatness of Monkey, or complain about how hard it is to get noticed, or anything else? I'll just book a few meetings over the days - so my schedule will be pretty free.<br><br>Or maybe you've attended Casual Connect events and could offer some hints about how I could maximize my time there? My goals are to catch any low-hanging fruit for distribution possibilities, to investigate what genres I could move into for optimizing performance, see if it's worth going into social casino games, and possibly find developers to cooperate with (or outsource development work to). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Try to talk to your neighbors in the Indie Prize area, you're bound to make some new friends :)<br><br>Don't forget to take lots of business cards - they'll fly fast.<br><br>The only day I had meetings was the last day, usually the "calm day", where everyone is already very tired - so not so many people to talk to.<br><br>Also be ready because you'll talk to a lot of people trying to sell you ads for your games.<br><br>All in all, Casual Connect was really fun - I had the pleasure to meet some fine people over there!<br><br>Edit: One thing that worked for me on the first day... is that I was *in costume* - to represent my "Escape from Alcatraz" game, I used a stripped shirt, and a small hat - and voil√°, instant prisoner ;)<br><br>Look at me over there: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2A4bK_BEpw" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2A4bK_BEpw</a><br>(Sorry for my awful english...!) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Business cards are ordered, and I'll prepare some elevator pitches and standard talks about the game :)<br><br>I'll have to think about how to handle the meetings vs lack of time. I'm dragging my wife along - and she graciously agreed to stand in now and then if I have to run off. But if it's as busy as you describe I may not get the chance anyway. I was actually hoping that Belgrade would attract fewer people than SF. (But then again, I assume I'll get even more choked with people trying to sell ads or services in that case. Prejudiced, me?! Never!)<br><br>The note about being in costume sounds awesome! It looks great in the video, and I can definitely see how it's a marvelous attention grabber. Since I have a superhero game it does make perfect sense for me too... I just don't know if people want to see me wearing spandex. :) I wonder if I can get one of those fake washboard things to have underneath the costume...<br><br>Cheers, and thanks a bunch! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
