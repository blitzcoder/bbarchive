This was somewhere in the 2007 timeframe. <br><br>The results were astounding with what we could make in that small amount of code :) Plus, it tests every competator's abilities and shows off the shear power of the language :) What a blast.<br><br>Someone made up the rules and timelines for the competition. Then they could post their code in a codebox for everyone to see. Everyone that wished to compete would simply make their code and post it back to the same thread. <br><br>The judging I thought was a bit closed, and I'd prefer that we had a voting system of some sorts. Perhaps at the end of the post after the time elapsed, the forum votes by posting their vote? Even give the judging a timeframe. After the timeframe elapses, the person that created the competition would tally the results and post the winner(s).<br><br>Take a look here (if you have access to the BlitzMAX forums):<br><a href="http://www.blitzmax.com/Community/posts.php?topic=67848" target="_blank">200byteDemoChallenge!</a><br><br>For those that can't access the forum, here's the opening post:<br><div class="quote"> <br>edit: ekk! the titles wrong! 250 (255 if you must!) not 200!!!<br><br>heres the rules<br><br>your source code cannot exceed 250 bytes<br>it can only use standard brl and pub modules<br>it should not be OS specific<br>your demo can not load or otherwise download media<br><br>heres my submission (should be easy to beat!)<br><br>Graphics 640,480;b=999;d#=24;h=16;For n#= 0 To b;d:*.997;Plot h+d*Sin(n),h+d*Cos(n);Next;p=grabpixmap(0,0,32,32);h:*3;While 1;cls;o:+1;d=400;for l=o to o+b+b step 40;d:*.99;drawpixmap p,h+d*cos(l),h+d*sin(l*1.2);next;flip;Wend<br><br><br> on a single line it comes to 226 bytes <br> <br></div><br><br>Here's where later in the thread he set some time limits and spoke of judging:<br><div class="quote"> <br>holy bytes! coder boy!<br><br>This is an amazing thread, I've been a bit busy for a few days and expected to come back to it with just one or two new entries<br><br>I've decided there should be an end date! 2007-03-18 23:59PM GMT<br><br>time permitting a few days later I will come up with a winner (somehow!!!) but its going to be a hard job picking just a single winner, I may end up picking several winners in different categories<br><br>So you have till the end of the weekend coming guys get cracking, here's a clue colour soap bubbles and Twin Nucleus are both very defiantly in with a very good chance.<br><br>I have to say the over all standard has really impressed me, and there are certainly no losers here. <br> <br></div><br><br>Just adapt it for Monkey :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Its related to the topic, but not as a DEMO per-se. It IS demo-ing the capabilities, but in a very different way. The smallness was never intended to demo nice looking effects, but to see what kinda of creations developers in the community could achieve. The size limitation WAS the point to that particular challenge. Each challenge was different. One time its size, another time it could be you can't use anything but native commands to the language, and no external libraries. It could be anything for the challenge. This one I showed you was just an EXAMPLE.<br><br>The limitations were applied to give every one bounds by which they had to achieve the goal. Its just another little fun test of abilities. Its also a cool little way to get away from the normal day to day routine of coding what we all normally code. Go have some fun with this little contest of ability and creativity.<br><br>Granted, if you want to show true creativity, and really show off neat features, let the sky be the limit. Make the challenge interesting. Or Make the challenge be something like "What can you make with blah, given x amount of time." You don't have to win anything, other than the fact yours was chosen to be the best. You could have bounty based challenges too, where different companies sponsor the event - for this community, it could be any of the developers that decided to pitch in something for the winner(s).<br><br>Just ideas. Just fun. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
