I still am not sure how this helps the Indies?<br><br>I see they also have a Pro Subscription now for $79 per month, so you could get to the 90% level, jump on a subscription and finish the 10% as quickly as possible?<br><br>IMO the biggest thing standing in the way of using the "Free" version for mobile deployment would be the lack of Build Size Stripping.  An annoyance would be you can't create a custom Splash Screen so your app will always show the Unity splash.  But I think the Build size could get in the way of mobile success.<br><br>You can review the comparisons of the two versions here:<br><br><a href="https://store.unity3d.com/" target="_blank">https://store.unity3d.com/</a><br><br>IMO, the revenue share model is better for Indies, something that kicks in when revenues hit $60,000 or higher off a given title.  I do realize though that this sort of program is a lot more difficult to manage, but if you go Pro, you pay the same price (probably more with volume discounts) per license compared to the large studios.<br><br>Just FYI, the base empty iOS Unity Player code on an empty project is about 13MB, you can get that down to 6MB by using the Pro version's "Build Size Stripping" features.  I haven't built an iOS app with Monkey yet, but I am assuming a "hello world" Monkey iOS app is going to weigh in at something like 1 banana or so, nonetheless a far cry smaller than bundling a Player like Unity. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you already have a massive mailing list of people built up from doing other things than Unity projects who are target for the thing you would make with Unity that is a whole lot better than shooting in the dark. Following trends and making things people will obviously want is a hard way to fail. But it's difficult for people to look past themselves and their own tastes so often you have crap apps which no one wants because the developer made something just for them without getting any feedback or listening to negative feedback. There are tons of things you can do to move closer to being more likely to succeed.<br><br>No one knows you? You have no capital? You're clueless about making things which people want?

My primary source of income is selling the stuff I make. I've considered buying Unity but I just don't need to. Monkey does everything I need right now.<br><br>$5k is a big deal on its own to most indies, but if do your market research, build a large list of fans, do your due diligence then you can make smart investments which pay out. There are still people out there who spend the money and then do everything else wrong. Just buying Unity isn't magic, but it is a tool which can allow you to do certain things relatively easily and allow you to make more money than the license cost if you are driven to do so. <br><br>Tool makers targeting hobbyists is dumb pure and simple for the reasons illustrated in this thread. While I appreciate the low pricing of Monkey, it could be sold for much more and marketed better to sell better. Unity charging a higher price allows them dominate financially. They make a ton of money from licensing. There are a lot of people buying. Their community vastly outnumbers Monkey's even with Monkey's lower price. There are a lot of people using Unity in hacky ways to make 2D ways and it's needless, plus they spend thousands more from the licensing and the extra content they probably purchased to make 2D less painful, but they are the people who want to do this professionally and they are willing to invest the money even when it's not a clear path to success. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
