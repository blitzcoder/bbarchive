If so, what are your thoughts on it?<br><br>My experiences, after the initial awe wore off, reduced to the following issues:<br><br>Low resolution – “Distanced” objects and scenery appear very “blocky”. Unless the consumer version features a significant resolution upgrade, this will be problematic for those of us used to high resolution gaming experiences. Will 1080p be enough? Not sure. 4k would be better, but you'll require a decent computer to deliver that amount of pixels at 60fps.<br><br>“Motion” sickness – This is killer for me. I can endure only 10 minutes of immersion before I have to stop. I'm not ordinarily susceptible to motion sickness, in cars or in FPS games played on a screen, but the Rift really affects me. Some people adjust over time through subsequent sessions, unfortunately not yet for me. I'm hoping the consumer version's lower latency and other technological improvements will negate the problem.<br><br>Complete immersion – When the rift is strapped to your head, you're completely cut off from your real world surroundings. This is fantastic, yet at the same time actually bad, for several reasons. Ever tried typing on a keyboard while blind? It's difficult, even for experienced touch typists. Use a game controller? Yes, that solves issues of movement and basic interaction, and is suitable for certain game types, but not all, as I'm sure you can imagine. Another reason - it's nice to know what's going on around you in the real world, even on a subconscious level, lest you trip or fall or knock something or someone over, or get tangled in cords, etc. LOL.<br><br>Ergonomics – The Rift's ergonomics are actually fine unless you want to share the unit with multiple users. Swapping lenses in and out, diopter adjustment, head strap adjustments, wiping sweat and condensation from lenses, etc. Probably easier and more fun just to play the Xbox or PS in a family or party gathering. IMO.<br><br>In summary, I guess I'm not yet convinced the Oculus Rift will be the revolutionary gaming device some think it will be. It will depend on how improved the consumer version will be, but I am sceptical they can solve all the issues as I see them. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

To me, seeing the history of the older game makers on this forum and blitzbasic says more to me where gaming was and where it is going. in other words, it's not going anywhere, it's only going to mutate like any other industry, with boom times and down times. perhaps those that do well understand the mechanics and balance of coding and marketing.<br><br>also, to shoot for angry birds is a little over-reaching in my perspective. that was a one-in-million shot, and yet there are many far greater examples of indie developers living on a sustainable budget rather than those like mojang or rovio or new star soccer. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

IMO. <br></div><br><br>Everything that was mention is pretty much on point - for the <i>very first dev kit</i> that a lot of us have. Oculus has already stated many times that the current dev kit is no where near what they are planning for the consumer product. They're also very aware of these issues are already many steps ahead in solving issues that we haven't yet brought up yet. Their latest "Crystal Cove" dev kit their next release thats moving closer to the direction of consumer ready product, which makes progress in alleviating the blurriness and motion sickness issue. Not to mention positional tracking now!! But even with this version they've stated its not yet close to what they are targeting for either. As far as controls...thats up the developers on how they want to implement that. I have no issues the 360 control pad, and looking forward to that Omni Treadmill also. Never had the need to look at the keyboard unless i wanted to quit one of those Unity3d demos doing alt-f4 :p. <br><br>I mentioned last week that i loaded up the Oculus again and went for a spin on Euro Truck Simulator 2 and it was definitely one of the most immersive experience i've tried yet on the Rift. Last night i tried out this new demo called "The Cave" and this just takes the cake on the coolest demo ever and shows what good quality design and effort can produce visually even with the current dev kit's low resolution. My faith has been restored in VR. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
