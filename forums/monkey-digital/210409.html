Far better then Windows or OSX and without the data tracking and privacy invasion of Windows 10. It's freedom and it's free.<br><br>I should also point out that my current Alien Phoenix project is solely developed on Linux Mint from which I can build Monkey application for both Android and the desktop. Once the dependencies (<a href="http://www.monkey-x.com/Community/posts.php?topic=10088" target="_blank">see this easy guide</a>) are out of the way it is a breeze developing with Monkey on Linux Mint.

At the end of the day using Windows 10 at the very least is a vote for apathy. Many though feel strongly enough about privacy, control and alike to avoid it and the recent 'lets brute force users' into using Windows 10 is evidence of how off the mark MS is. Those how want to free themselves of data collection and forced control of their device will seek alternatives like Linux. The world of OS's is breaking down to Windows, Android, OSX, IOS and their controlled consumer model where the users has few options and is forced to surrender the intimate details of their lives . The only open environment for content creators is Linux where the details of your life are 'not' for sale to the highest bidder.<br><br>I have had fewer issues using Linux Mint then I did with Windows 7. Which from a new Linux Mint users point of view is pretty sweet. I hear lots of accounts of this does not work or that cant happen, which in my experience is just not the case. Overall my experience with Mint has been just great. I have it running on both a desktop system (Asus/Phenom II/Radeon 5770) and an Emachines laptop and both systems have preformed solidly and any issues I have encountered were solvable with a little research (and help from my buddies here in BRL land). So if you are reading this wondering about Linux don't reject it out-of-hand when you see the standard negative comments. Give it a try for yourself and see if it is a sweet alternative to what you are using now. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you use Linux software you won't have problems running it on Linux. If you need a Windows program, you can still use Wine to run it – a lot of windows programs run on Wine – even Games. Those who criticize Linux because Windows applications do not run on it as well as they do on Windows – just try to run a native Linux application on Windows :)<br><br>So why is it that most people use Windows instead of Linux? Linux leads in most fields – servers, mobile, embedded systems, … So why not on the Desktop? It is not true that it is hard to use. Lots of older people have even more problems using Windows than Linux. So why does everyone use Windows?   -   Linus Torvalds gave a very simple answer to this: It is just because Microsoft controls the market and most of the desktop PCs come with Windows preinstalled. And most people don't install any different system on their machines. Imagine 90 percent of the PCs would be delivered with Linux. How many people would buy Windows as a second operating system if they already have one? If lots of PCs would be delivered with Linux preinstalled, companies would also start writing Linux software because they want people to use their products. You see – the OS war is nothing else than the old conflict between capitalism and the peoples wish for freedom! If you find Windows comfortable – it is OK. In the old roman empire there were also slaves who lived a very comfortable life compared to the life they had before – some of them were really <br>satisfied.

The best Linux based things seem to fill a niche that isn't already served by Windows or Mac, and have distros which are specifically tailored for that application in mind. That's why I can't imagine using a phone without Android, a pi without raspbian, etc. These have corporate backing for their target application, and as a result you'd expect all the rough edges to be ironed out where the OS is commonly used. Linux has no such backing in the desktop world, so it will always be a second hand experience.

There are many factors that are and will change the path ahead and chief among them is security and privacy. Linux offers a path that is not available in the mainstream with distributions like Mint recording 'no' telemetry and offering a secure environment. Meeting what I would call the minimum safe environment. Beyond Linux are the mainstream OS's and the recent Windows 10. <br><br>Windows 10 to me is a seed change involving these very topics of security and privacy. On the one hand Windows 10 offers good security in general but this comes at a cost. The cost is as much discussed privacy. You can extend this to the other obvious OS's and it should become clear that there are two choices here. One where you can operate openly and privately and one where you can not. There is a real branch point I feel that we are all at right now and that maybe supporting the seemingly one OS (kernel) that meets that minimum safe environment is a good idea. <br><br>My recent experience with Mint compared to an attempt at Debian some years ago is astonishing better. Simple to install, use and ultimately get just right. For the audience here well within the learning curve. Monkey X1 and X2 work great on Mint and are easy to get running. I guess my point here in this thread is first, if you have not tried Monkey and Linux Mint that perhaps you might want to give it a try and see for yourself that you can support Linux and with a relatively small investment in time. It's a path worth exploring and wholly viable and for the most part can bring a loyal following to your project. Secondly choosing to use Linux in the current privacy setting is a vote for sane privacy practices. Not the only reason to use Linux but I believe one benefit worth supporting. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you only want to do some office work, Image manipulation, web browsing, etc. you do not need the command line at all.

Windows 10's amount of "connected" functionality can be somewhat disturbing for privacy advocates.  I find it acceptable for my use once I disable most of the personally-identifyable stuff like cortana and the keylogger.  The fact that it logs what people type into "non-connected" query boxes all over the OS is pretty disturbing, but it's also something that appears to be an "always-connected" inevitability considering that many of us have already given up that privacy using GMail or ChromeOS.  People will give up their privacy because they don't see how it is an invasion anymore, and instead what they see instead is an "impartial" algorithm giving them better tailored results.<br><br>OTOH, what you trade for your privacy on Linux isn't just the type of experience you might expect on a previous version of windows (before everything was "connected"), in some ways it is much less polished than even that.  What you have is an advanced piece of kit which works fantastic for certain tasks (as others have pointed out in this thread!) and would take an incredible effort to configure for certain other tasks.  Privacy is more like an "icing on the cake" inherent feature of an open source system, although that was not necessarily the original intent.  Merely a bonus you get with the fine control you have over the OS.<br><br>One day I hope Microsoft will continue to move on with Windows beyond the phase where it is considered a product in itself to where it is a service only, with no vendor lock in for the underlying system.  To that end, they always seem to develop new kernels with cross-platform  in mind, only to settle back to the comfortable position of "well, most people appear to be using just this platform for our stuff, so we should go back to concentrating development there".  NT, CE, RT, Azure, yadda yadda.  When they become like IBM and the desktop stops being their core market is when you'll see Windows finally recede into being just another operating system that anyone can roll a distro for. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Sometimes you have to wait over an hour because Windows installs tons of updates at startup – and when it is finally done, the first thing you see on your desktop are two or three pop-up messages telling you that you should update Java and some Adobe stuff – because Windows does not update this software! Linux on the other hand updates most of your software and while the updates get installed you can continue whatever you want to do.<br><br>An other thing that is really complicated on Windows is customization. It is not easy to change the look and feel of the system. If you want to change some system icons and the graphics of your windows, you have to use the registry editor, hack inside system dlls using resource editors and do tons of other complicated stuff. And in the end some system update overwrites the modified dlls and destroy all your hard work. On Windows you must be a hacker to change the appearance of your user interface – and people say Linux is complicated :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Examples of data we collect include your name, email address, preferences and interests; browsing, search and file history; phone call and SMS data; device configuration and sensor data; and application usage. <br></div><br>The phrase "Examples of data we collect" is nonspecific and by many accounts really describes nothing in detail.

The phrase "we may collect information about the file" is nonspecific. The phrase "such as improving performance" is nonspecific and open ended (such as) and really describes only one aspect of what they can do.<br><br>I could go on and on but I hope you can see my point and the point of many others out there that have a better grasp on the legal aspect then I do.<br><br>Edit: I'm checking to see if the copy I have has been updated just in case. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
