It could well be a simple configuration issue if their site is really as minimal as you say.<br><br>If they're not happy with Dreamhost and want to try a sideways move to a similarly priced service then I recommend Webfaction. They focus on being developer friendly, which means very configurable hosting and knowledgeable and responsive support staff. It also means they're on the ball with issues due to shared resources being hogged by individual users. I don't host commerce sites with them but I've rarely heard a bad word said about their uptime. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I know of linode and love it, but I've only used VPS there. It may be a good option too, but I think the managed service is expensive, and I don't think unmanaged is an option for my client. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
