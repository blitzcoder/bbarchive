If you don't have browser plugins installed, and don't run untrusted programs, your chances of your computer getting infected are slim. Even then a large number of Windows users do have AV on, while the same can't be said for Mac/Linux users as their common uses have a false sense of security. All it takes is to run and give permission to one bad program and your computer gets owned no matter the OS, and if the malware is new and not using common methods even AV won't be able to stop the user error of running it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Couldn't have said it better. People using Mac/Linux also get the false secure feeling because they are not prone to Windows viruses. Which are far more common. <br><br>@silentshark: Its all in the eye of the beholder. If you "feel" better about having such applications installed, go for it. In my experience, they provide me no further protection from an attack with them on or off. Just using good sense gets you a long way in keeping your computer running tip top shape. I will not argue about your personal views on how you wish to manage your computers, but none of my computers run any of this software. I have Mac, Linux, and Windows all happy running behind my firewall, and I have't had any issues in the past 15 years running like this. I've built many computers and installed endless pieces of software upon them. Like Soap stated, its the user that makes their system fail with loads of harmful software. Rarely have I seen a virus spread on its own that is so destructive that a nice AV app could have prevented it from spreading. We did have one here at work, but again it was a user that ran the apps that allowed it to spread. Infact, with the virus definition completely up to date and on full alert, it still spread unknowingly until we encountered performance issues.<br><br>That said, if I ever encountered a virus, I'd simply wipe the computer clean and intstall the OS again. Some people have so many viruses on their computers that it couldn't possibly function. <br><br>I've always told anyone that asked my opinion is that it would be up to them. If they felt it would benefit them then install the sw and keep it updated. Regardless of what they did with that, I'd tell them to keep an eye out for what they are doing online and what goes into their disk or USB drives. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

To stay safe, I use NoScript and basically never install anything I can't validate inside out :)<br><br>If you absolutely must have some form of virus protection, I recommend MSE, formerly Windows Defender.  It runs in the background and stays out of your way.  I run it on my work laptop, which doesn't need to be as fast or optimized as my main machine, and is potentially exposed to more hazards from surfing on dirty wi-fi connections..... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
