But the game catalog if GMS which has been released and was/is successful is amazing. There isn't much you can't do with it, if anything.<br>I wouldn't worry. They have updated GMS regularly and I am sure they will do the same with GMS2. Personally I am waiting for GMS2 on OSX to arrive before I upgrade. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'm also hoping that the new Playniax editor offers a similar increase in productivity, though I'm not going to be switching to mx2 anytime soon until someone makes an IDE as comprehensive as Jungle's.  Actually having project files is kinda a big deal for me these days, and I've been spoiled and don't feel comfortable coding without the types of amenities IDEs like VS and Jungle offer..<br><br>GMS2 has switched to a more tile-based engine, so if your game is more of a tile-based game (many 2d games) this is pretty helpful.  Audio support could be better but at least it seems you can make seamless ogg music with custom loopback points, something I badly wish Monkey had.  Shader support also looks pretty good.  GMS2's visual event-based coding pipeline can be "baked" to GML code, letting you use their visual flow editor when it's easy and dropping down to GML when necessary.  That's something that you could <i>only</i> do with a really tightly integrated engine and editor, so it's unlikely Monkey will see something like this unless Tony and ziggy take up the torch of pushing something like MonkeyX Studio, only even more tightly integrated.<br><br>Big disadvantages of GMS2 are the same as most other "black boxes", you have to use their compilers and are 100% dependent on them to support your target of choice.  If there's a problem with their engine/runtime environment, all you can do is try to find a workaround or pray.  You gotta pay to keep supporting the system, since the community only handles plugins and such, not the base programs, and there is some fragmentation between versions (particularly regarding plugins/extensions). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you do get stuck with anything there is less and less people to ask and if you do ask a question its a mixed barrel if its going to be answered as there might not be anyone to answer it for you.<br><br>Ive now moved to other engines and writing my own so I can have stability for the years ahead, yes MX2 is nice BUT with the past of BRL I dont see it being a stable place to be what with all the languages they have made over the years which are all now crumbling wrecks by the wayside. What we do need is a definitive plan from BRL about what they are doing and where they are going not a load of abandoned sites and forums about where they have been. Personally I would like to see ALL the sites merged together under the www.BRL.com banner this would allow people to see what they have done in the past and what is current now, it would also mean people wouldnt need to visit three seperate forums to see all the BRL product line.<br><br>I might look at godot but at present I am coding using a well known engine which is also free and has a great community and support ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
