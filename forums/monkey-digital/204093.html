As part of the research project, we introduced a new domain memory API to support the compiler. In September 2011, we announced plans to invest in the technology and release it as part of a paid production offering for commercial development. We are now renaming project “Alchemy,” the Flash Runtime  C++ Compiler (flascc).<br><br>Will there be a way to use domain memory from ActionScript 3 without flascc?<br>We do not believe developers should have to use C/C++ to get faster performance. Exposing similar low-level domain memory from AS3 would be a temporary, inelegant approach that we do not want to rely on longer term in ActionScript. Instead, we intend to improve the general performance of ActionScript while retaining its simplicity and approachability. Developers can use third party tools, such as Unity, to leverage domain memory in addition to C/C++ with flascc. <br></div><br><br>I wonder if by increase performance they mean support hardware acceleration.<br><br>I can't see this encouraging developers to use Adobe's products. Flash is not at all the best tool to make iOS/Android products, and that seems to be a major target for them. Additionally, 3d games still are better played on platforms like Steam as desktop games. Adobe clearly intends to target big developers, but you know they are about making money first, and they will jump ship as soon as better opportunity comes. Adobe's tools are NOT the best tools for making 3d games. Their really only vector for monetization for this is dumb developers using it to build 2d iOS/Android apps, or Unity/Unreal developers wanting to monetize 3d products in the browser. I think it's more likely if a big developer is going to be making a lot with a browser application they are going to build their own native plugin as Unity and others have already done and encourage users to use that for best performance (or just have the browser launch native apps), leaving the Flash builds only as demos with zero monetization. It will be interesting to see how it plays out. If they offered a flat fee, or even a yearly subscription at a reasonable price I would be more willing, but as it is it screams greed, bad ideas, and room for them to exploit developers by increasing costs if enough buy into it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Every serious developer will pay for this like they already do. Yes, even if an app doesn't make 50k, I'd still rather pay $99 a year for a dev license than the potential to pay an additional 9% to Adobe (on top of other costs), because it's never as simple as that.<br><br>Their move does not help them out, it does not put developers on their side. It only hurts them. Sure you may not see any problem with their actions and it may seem reasonable to you, but it's not a strategy which will keep them around and in favor. This move is toxic and will make devs want to stay away more than anything. It's sad to see them so seemingly clueless when they are already losing the battles. Mobile devices do not want to support Flash. Sure they can support native apps made from Flash, but that still doesn't mean that those users will be using Flash on websites, and that's where Adobe's greatest leverage is at. Developers have the power to make this transition even quicker when they support HTML5 instead of Flash or even along side it. With the big migration from desktop to tablet computers the value of Flash diminishes. You don't want to use something that a huge number of your users can't possibly take advantage of. These features are attractive and useful for developers, and can give more life to Flash products, but as it is their monetization strategy just is not good, and so long term they continue to lose viability. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Sure, if you don't like it don't use it.  And you can still even use Flash for free if you don't want the premium features.  Not so different from the Unity model - which isn't even full-featured until you pay them $1500 up front - and I don't see the hate there. [Sure, Unity is much better if you do hit the $50000 range.  Horses for courses, and all.]<br><br>As for Flash, its future is looking better to me than it did a year ago, given the apparent paralysis of HTML5. I used to hate it for the lack of a right mouse button, but given the necessity of designing for touch interfaces, this is not so important any more. <br><br>Every reasonable pricing model suits some people and hurts others.  It's good that there is choice.  I bet there a ton of indie developers and would-be indie developers who like this a lot better than paying $99 a year. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
