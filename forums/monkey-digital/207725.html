More games will offer rewards over typical achievements, rewards that are only redeemable in other titles. This presents a big opportunity for large publishers with multiple franchises releasing at the same time, but it’s also an opportunity for indies to band together and make things more interesting. Imagine a DLC pack that isn’t unlocked by just buying it, no, you need to earn it in a completely different (but slightly related) game!"<br><br>Now... what about we try something like it? We assemble a list of games we're going to release, and add to them some sort of achievement that would unlock things on other games? Could be something very simple, like when the user does something on game X, he gets a code, that typed on game Y will give something... maybe it could be a great way to cross promote our games?<br><br>I know this won't fly with published games, and probably there is a ton of other problems I can't think right now... but what do you guys think about this? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Once the user click on it, the game asks the player to enter a code, like the one I posted above.
