As Monkey works by translation to native Obj-C it's not an option to do something similar.<br><br>As for the language it's certainly not better than Monkey. The interest for me is in seeing and comparing the marketed features of a direct competitor that appears to be running a successful (albeit financially modest) funding campaign. <br><br>While the language is more primitive it offers clearer high-level frameworks to creating a game (map editor, sprite system with collisions, particles, physics). Many of those features exist in the Monkey world via community activity but AGK takes the bold step of actually telling the customers that they exist. I wonder if that makes a difference. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
