Using source control, you have way more options available to you.<br><br>Each time you commit, you add a comment, and the files are recorded at that specific version.  This can allow you to go back and see how things have developed at a file level, not just at an archive level.  It's also a lot more convenient than having to un-rar old snapshots if you're trying to track down which code change has introduced a bug.<br><br>As for branches, you can work on multiple of them at the same time.  Say you have a couple of different features you want to test out, but they make take a while to implement, and you need to continue development of the main features in the meantime.  Sure, you could just use separate folders and work on different copies, but what if you need to port changes from one to the other ... there's a lot more work involved if you are manually tracking which files have changed in each copy, while source control can do this for you.<br><br>There are lots of other benefits to using source control, but the best way to find out is to start using it.  Everybody has their own style of workflow, so it's hard to pinpoint exactly how this would benefit YOU, so the benefits I mentioned are very general. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
