Is enough money coming in to get by and a bit in the bank wealthy to you? Mortgage-free on a modest semi-detached in some cheap town in the north of England? Swanky pad in London/NY/Paris and enough cash to never have to work again if you don't want to? Owning a crewed yacht? Owning an island?<br><br>Secondly, the question "can anyone achieve this?" (assuming we get a definition of "this") can be read two ways depending on how relaxed you are about interpretation: "Is it something that is achievable by pretty much any individual?" or "Is it something that is achievable at all?".<br><br>If you meant the first then no, I'd say it isn't. Simply creating a functioning game isn't something that most people can do -- even with Monkey. Creating a game that might sell in large quantities in the maturing mobile market is much harder still.<br><br>If you meant the second then the answer is demonstrably yes (providing that your expectations of wealth are modest). At least for the moment it is still possible for a solo dev or small team to create games that can break into the big sellers and generate thousands of dollars a day. Doing so is not easy, not predictable and not very likely if you consider how many games projects are started to how many finish, never mind make a few sales, but it can be done. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Mobile is hot, games are a viable and growing business that is rivaling the movie business. Zynga is huge and is buying out lots of businesses, Big Fish Games just swapped their CEO so they may be up for new acquisitions, EA is buying out many many small game makers here in the Bay Area.<br><br>Now's the time I say.

How much do you want to make? You can make 100k a year being a nurse in some places, and helping people is very rewarding. Most people who make games won't make money - many iOS games which don't break the top 100 do not make up for dev costs. For every game which sells well, there is another game with even more polish, time, and money put into it which just doesn't sell. There's skill involved, but also luck. It's not completely bleak but just a reality check... only do this if you genuinely enjoy it, not that you want to get rich. It can't just be about money, but it also can't not be about money. Success favors perseverance. I agree with you too. Right now is the best time ever to be making games. :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Starting with Monkey is a great choice.  Being able to release to so many platforms is a HUGE advantage.  Following a model like New Star Soccer where you can publish a flash version to help drive sales to mobile/PC versions is what I will do if I ever actually finish something decent!<br><br>The potential is there with hard work and polish and even some luck.
