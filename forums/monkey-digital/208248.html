This was a Research Machines 380Z. A lumbering beast where you loaded the BASIC interpreter in on 5 1/4" floppy disks. This was 1981 thought so everything was about to exploder, the ZX81, spectrum, Vic20, C64, BBC Micro all got launched within the next couple of years.<br><br>So by the time I left upper school there was a dedicated computer room with 15 BBC Micro Bs hooked up to microvitec cub monitors.<br><br>I think it was far more interesting back then. Everything was new and innovative and revolutionary. Now everything is just evolutionary. Back in the 80s you either used BASIC or for performance you dropped into Z80/6502 assembler. Now there is 101 languages and 2d/3d game development tools/frameworks. Almost too much choice! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
