Diddy is an elaborate framework that has most everything you need to get your game up and running in no time and readily reads TiLED TMX formatted files. There is also PhantomEngine Framework for the free game frameworks on Monkey. If you don't mind spending some money, Ignition will provide a similar experience to Diddy, but it includes its own tile map editor and map engine format. <br><br>I have been able to produce some basic games quickly using these frameworks. I'm relatively new to Monkey at that. I've not used Game Maker, so I can't vouch at all for it. Unity does have a steep learning curve, but has the ability to produce some very nice high quality games. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Bottom line is you spend so much time looking at them you don't get anything done!<br><br>I started doing app development (iOS) 3 years having been a long time developer (business apps for day job) using basic, clipper, foxpro and delphi for 20 years. I wanted to write a game for iOS and I wanted something simple so found GameSalad. Very similar to Stencyl but the performance was lacking.<br><br>I then found Cocos2D for iphone. I built one game with that, a simple stack-up type game and put this on the app store. Then I got interested in cross platform and discovered Corona SDK which allows you to target iOS and Android. Only problem is its 'build in the cloud' but I did release another game with this.<br><br>After this I was searching for a truly cross platform tool so looked at Javascript game frameworks and settled for ImpactJS which isn't free but seemed the best out of the frameworks there. The plan was to develop something using this and package using CocoonJS for mobile.<br><br>I then discovered Monkey and have been playing with it for a couple of months. It really is the only true web/mobile multi-platform tool around and is reasonably easy to use.<br><br>So find 1 thing and stick with it! As is often said, the best development tool is the one you are using.<br><br>Gary <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

While i'm not too particular to using one or the other (obvioulsy we're all going to be biased towards monkey here) but I wouldn't put too much emphasis on tools based how simple it is. Personally, i would prefer it to be as simple as livid possible if it can let me build the kind of game i want it to make. Of course i can make a list of pros and cons of each one based on my experiences but just like some one else sorta mention earlier, learn a tool, learn it well, and stick with it. People have done amazing stuff with each tools/engines/languages mentioned already in this thread.<br><br>For example, this fella here is an artist but by using "drag and drop" editors like Construct 2 (actually he using the older Construct Engine) and MMF2, he's able to put together some fancy stuff in a shorter amount of time than most coders would :  <br><a href="http://www.konjak.org/" target="_blank">http://www.konjak.org/</a><br><br>And this hilarious Australian guy (this dude is fun to talk with) strictly uses MMF2 (Multimedia Fusion 2) for all his work and pulls off some amazing stuff :<br><a href="http://www.farmergnome.com/" target="_blank">http://www.farmergnome.com/</a><br><br>And i could on with others...but thats just my 2.5 cents... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Thanks to Unity3D I don't need to search anymore. The learning curve is not that steep ! When you get stuck somewhere, documentation / Support / Community / Assets are so active that it generally only takes a few minutes to find many solid solutions.
