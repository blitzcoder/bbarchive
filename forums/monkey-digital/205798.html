Since September last year I am working at this Adventure Hidden Object game. I am making it with BlitzMax for windows and mac and Monkey for ipads and tablets, of course.<br><br>I have a dead line on this September and it is very close. I still have a lot to do, but for now I am interested in how long will it take to a normal player to advance in the game.<br>I sent this build to some casual game players (former clients of my previous games) but I would like to also receive some feedbacks from you.<br><br>This is the download link:<br><a href="http://rvlgames.com/ahogbuild.zip" target="_blank">http://rvlgames.com/ahogbuild.zip</a><br><br>The game has a checking method at the start, so you will have to wait a few seconds, depending of your Internet speed. NO DATA is collected by me. Just check on my server if the build is stil playable :)<br><br>The game itself is far to be polished, but I tried to make a test version good enought to be playable. You will encoutner a few bugs but nothing annoying.. I hope.<br><br>So, if you like to have a look and help me will be great. Also if you have friends, girlfriends, mothers, wifes, etc. who likes to play this type of game send it to them.<br><br>I am interested in how long did you take to find the "Blue Crystal".<br><br>Any questions or feedback, write it here.<br><br>Thank you <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The graphics and presentation seem up to scratch for the genre. I got the rope cursor bug too. I'm also seeing a lot of English errors, e.g. cheisel instead of chisel, hearth instead of heart.<br><br>The spelling and grammar errors aren't so much of an issue but getting entirely the wrong word or using an questionable/unusual term (describing what looks like a chopping board as a trencher, for example) is problematic in a HOG.<br><br>Edit: Is the game actually completable? I spent ages fiddling with the sea-horse puzzle and failing to solve it. I then skipped it but it didn't unlock anything or give me an item. I can't tell if the puzzle is bugged or I'm just missing something.<br><br>Edit2: It definitely seems as if there are blocking bugs. The hotspots in the greenhouse don't seem to be working. I got a "you need something thinner" message from clicking on the crack in the fountain once, tried using the knife and tweezers on it and then stopped getting any response from clicking.<br><br>There's also a supposed HO hotspot in there that I'm not getting (apart from no particle effect when clicking on the area) although I can't be sure if that unlocks later.<br><br>Edit3: I got the greenhouse gear after exiting and entering the greenhouse a few times and using the knife on the crack. I only knew to try it because I peeked at the xml though. I was getting no notification of the hotspot. I've got the blue crystal.

It's probably best to provide a walkthrough too.<br><br>I enjoyed what I played of the game. I was surprised at how few hidden object sections there were though. Also I did feel a bit direction-less at times. I'm not a big fan of having to run around checking to see if a HO section or a puzzle have mysteriously become active either, perhaps simple hints can be given, e.g. "Maybe I should look in the car again to see if there's something useful". You might also want to think about giving notification on mouseover that things can be picked up as it's frustrating to find you've missed something. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
