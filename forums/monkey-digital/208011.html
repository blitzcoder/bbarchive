There was no "offline" mode. Macros were not stored locally, they were in the "cloud". You could not disable the Synapse login dialog from popping up unless it was set to automatically log-in - which took a noticeable chunk of time.<br><br>Maybe this policy has changed? Can you now actually install the Synapse 2 driver, NOT create an account in Razer's "cloud", adjust the backlight, and set up some macros? All preserved when you reboot your computer?
