It's also playable <strike>in</strike> <b>over</b> a LAN.<br><br>Asteroids, lots of <strike>it</strike> them<strike>.</strike>, <b>a</b>nd <b>your</b> satellites <b>are</b> out of order. At your disposal are fire bows, aiming rockets, spinning stars and blue energy. <br><br>Are you a space rider ? <i>Is this meant to be rider or raider?</i><br>Then don't miss Asteroids Ultimate, and be prepared to save the planet - and yourself <strike>!</strike> - from <strike>wawes</strike> <b>waves</b> of stones, <strike>debrits</strike> <b>debris</b> and crazy robots. <br><br>If you are brave enough, you'll able to save your score in the hall of fame and become famous worldwide!<br><br>Are you good at 3D First Person Shooter<b>s</b>? <br>Do you think you have no rivals? <br><br>Wait before you try Dangerous Robots. Take a deep breath and jump into the arena. <br>Dangerous Robots is hard to master, very hard. Don't say I didn't <strike>warned</strike> <b>warn</b> you !!<br><br>------------------------------------------<br><br><b>Asteroids 70's</b><br>A remake of the legendary Asteroids, featuring endless levels with increasing difficulty. <br><br>This remake allows <b>you to</b> also record and playback a whole game session, which can be later played randomly. Three default playback files are included, and new ones can be recorded and exchanged with other players. <br><br>An interesting application of this feature would be showing the playback in a shop - and watch<b>ing</b> the customers <strike>being</strike> <b>become</b> hooked... ;-)<br><br>------------------------------------------<br><br><b>BomberLAN</b><br>Check out this remake of the legendary Dynablaster Bomberman! <br><br>This full<b>y</b> functional<strike>ly</strike> multiplayer game can be played between 2 players on a local pc or in a network (LAN), and brings lots of fun! <br>This version is very close<strike>d</strike> to the look, feel and speed of the Amiga version.

Despite its <strike>easy</strike> <b>simple</b> graphics and the lack of sfx, it shows <strike>a</strike> nice A.I. which could be hard to beat. <br><br>Controls are: arrow keys to move, alt to strife, and left control to fire. You can repair the <strike>armor</strike> <b>armour</b> by picking <b>up</b> the repair<strike>ing</strike> box that drops <b>from </b> time to time<strike>.</strike><b>,</b> <strike>B</strike> but the opponent robots can also do that...
