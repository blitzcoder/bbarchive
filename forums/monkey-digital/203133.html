I can still be reached via email if anyone wants any help with projects and things :)<br><br>So yeah its the end of an era I been frequenting the forum for over twelve years but I think its time to try something that seems to actually be going places.<br><br>I could never get to grips with monkey with its cryptic error messages or just plain crashing so I let it fall by the wayside, but for those who have actually made things with it I wish ya good luck.<br><br>So I bid ya all adieu.... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you think I'm wrong take a look at Interstellar Marines which has been developed by a very small team.  I can't even imagine attempting that in Monkey.
