Execution matters. If someone can make it work then great, but ideas are not worth anything, and their ideas were plainly not thought out well.<br><br>They want to solve waste and lower the price by making a component based phone. Except that not having all of the components designed together for maximum efficiency, having components with their own layers of material would cost more and waste more. It would be bulkier, heavier, less resistant to damage, more vulnerable to every day elements.<br><br>Wouldn't it be great if we had personal jetpacks? We can have them now, but they are prohibitively expensive and wasteful with current tech.<br><br>They are marketing this very old component based idea except they do not have the missing link of new tech to make it better in every way than what is already common.<br><br>The parts which matter most are the screen, the battery, and everything else as a unit. More phones used to be able to have those all replaced independently, but now many do not even let you replace the battery with convenience, but it is still a tradeoff for what the customer wants to buy (higher quality, not having to be made to think, keeping things simple), and it is the market which ultimately sways what people focus on making commercially.<br><br>Most of us have desktops which we build from components, but we are power users. Normal users increasingly do not want to be bothered with all of that. They want a black box which abstracts away the complexity of building what they want.
