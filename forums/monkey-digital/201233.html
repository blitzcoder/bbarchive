The Lodsys patent doesn't simply read "If you buy something via a bit of software, you need to pay us, LOL!". It's actually a number of very specific patents, pertaining to a very specific solution. You should also know that Lodsys LLC isn't a mega company with deep pockets, who's abusing the system, and anyone claiming so is eschewing the facts, and being deliberately misleading (or arguing from ignorance, whichever you think is worst). Lodsys LLC is simply the legal entity of inventor Dan Abelow. Lodsys is the "independent inventor" and all the big boys are screwing him over, because they have all the money in the world. So you can all drop your righteous anger at them, as this is actually one of the few cases where patent law is working as intended (that is protecting the inventor from having his invention exploited by large corporations).<br><br>Yes it's unfortunate that a few developers get caught in the crossfire, but to be honest, Roxio has made over 24 million USD on Angry Birds (the game alone, not counting the merchandise which is probably triple that), they can probably afford to pay a license to the guy who made it possible for them to become rich. If the shoe was on the other foot, and Lodsys LLC where selling knock-off Angry Birds plushies, would people still side with the party willfully breaking the law? I think not. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I wasn't aware patents where only designed to protect "novel" ideas. How do you measure what ideas are novel? The patent was granted in 2007, and if your idea isn't plagiarising the Lodsys idea (that is, you came up with it entirely independently) you're in the clear.

I remember it being a subjective term that is used in their review process. In other words they do not allow patents on ideas that are common enough to be in the public domain. There are already companies that have challeneged Lodsys patents for US internal review based on the 'is it novel enough' rule.<br><br>So what i'm trying to point out is that if one could prove to the USPO that the idea was already in the public domain, then the patent could be reviewed and revoked.<br><br>Another point: patents for DNA are not meant to protect the invention, since no one invented the dna in our cells, but rather the millions of dollars of research that was done to get the sequencing. So overall patents can be used for good, protecting those who actually do the work, versus patenting a work process that many people will eventually do on their own.<br><br>Lodsys is targeting anyone with a "buy from our online store" button, not specifically over a specific api.

Do I think it's pointless and wasteful? Yes. Do I agree that software patents stifle innovation? Absolutely. Patents in general, and software patents in particular are anachronisms with no place in modern society (much like copyrights) that where not originally designed to account for corporate greed and lobbyist.
