As far as I understood, it even branches into the 'story'.<br>Imo Braid is a must-play-game for every gamedev. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It works out pretty well.<br><br>I also found the platform puzzler Closure surprisingly good-- fundamentally, all the puzzles revolve around what is visible on-screen and the game is entirely in darkness, save for the lightsources that make up the puzzles. If something blocks your way, find a way to put it in darkness. If you need a floor to walk on, find a way to put some light on it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
