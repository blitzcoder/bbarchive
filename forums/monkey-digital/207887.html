There are plenty of people out there willing to sell "generic endless runner/jumper" source. Reskinners mostly just try to ride a wave of early interest, take the ad revenue and whatever IAP they manage to get, hopefully cover their art and marketing costs and then move on. I'm not convinced by some of the high income claims for this sort of thing and I suspect it's going to increasingly become an exercise in barrel scraping.<br><br>Flappy Bird is a complete red herring as far as looking for "how to make profitable games". It's an unreproducible fluke. All it does is mark a low bar for what can go viral. It's "Agadoo" or "Crazy Frog" in game form.<br><br>Back to the original question, any game size can work. What's big and small anyway? Is Super Meat Boy a big or small game? Gunpoint? VVVVVVV? What works in terms of scale is market dependent. If you're selling web games to sponsors then the market seems to mostly want games priced at around a month of effort. If you're selling to Big Fish then there's a much higher expectation level for content quality and longevity. Mobile will still accept free five-minute wonders but the Steam audience generally wants something with more substance.<br><br>From a marketing perspective you'd try to identify an underserved area (Squirrel-themed third person JRPGs on iPad or whatever), calculate the balance between what size of game they like and what level of up-front risk you're willing to take and then design your game. I doubt that's how most successful Indies work though. I imagine they get the idea and then go to find a market. Alternatively you can slap together a video and Kickstarter it and shovel most of the risk back on the consumer. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Big games are high risk / high reward.  Remember that you need to <i>finish</i> a game in order for it to make any money.  Don't tackle big games until you can prove you can tackle multiple small ones in a reasonable timeframe.  While you're working on that big game, it's not "paying you back", so to speak, so even if you want to go for the big catch, you should probably make a few small games first to beef up your income level and give yourself more breathing room to invest in the big project.<br><br>Edit:  And also, I totally believe in the power of networking when it comes to "viral" marketing.  Nothing ever happens for no reason;  if something springs into huge popularity "overnight" you can usually bet there was a strong push hiding somewhere behind whatever that thing is.  Youtube personalities, probably a great example.  If you want your game to get eyeballs, you should probably appeal directly to these guys, and skip the big gamers' news outlets -- they won't usually cover your game unless you've got the right people giving your game the eyeball already.  You can use reviews from these guys to help schmooze your way into a big gaming news site later, if one of their guys doesn't just write an article for you, anyway.

If indie game developers in general (including myself and my crappy games), didn't ever settle for "small" games and call them done then there would be a lot less crap clogging up the app stores right now. This whole idea of "small" to me is just the same as saying "minimal, incomplete effort" or "no talent exerted".To me it's much more fulfilling to make a game that is worth $20 a pop and sells well and get satisfied customers/reviews and make minimum wage rather than to get retired off of making something primitive and stupid (like angry birds) that sells for $1 a million times through in a week. IMHO financial profits are &lt; making a game that people thoroughly enjoy. Much less important, by far.<br><br>I don't want to make me happy, I want to make my customers happy. I have so many fun memories of playing Mario and Sonic with my family and friends. If I ever see the day someone plays my game not because I told them to but out of their own interest and they later down the road have many fond memories of playing that game that I made and that my hard work made them happy there's nothing I care more about as an indie game developer than to make games that are fun and can build family memories, etc. It's stupid and really figures because I fail miserably at it, my games are retarded. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Hours and hours of fun if you are really in to this genre. He did all of it completely by himself except for the music and audio which were done by people he hired. This is common to hire people to do music even for indie devs, someone actually liked my games so much he offered to do music for me for free. And he didn't let anyone use the music but me so it would be original to my game. Back on my subject, Simon's game has an official OST. Music you won't be able to find anywhere else.<br><br><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=95628194" target="_blank">http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=95628194</a><br><br>Please see the official YouTube advertisement video for his game ASA: A Space Adventure. This guy, Simon, is my inspiration for my current project I'm making a Myst-style game too right now and it's coming along beautifly. Though it's not a rip, his is about outer space while mine has a setting in an underground castle - everything's quite different other than the mutual Myst genre. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Myst is a slideshow game that was originally driven by Hypercard. The technical issues came down to 3D rendering and storage, neither of which are problems now. You're left with a mechanical genre where dev effort is pretty much entirely on pre-rendered graphics and the puzzle design. To call that a "big" game that gets lumped in with CoD/Halo etc. is hard to follow.<br><br>Further, I really don't understand the tone of value judgement being brought into the thread. The question was about financial viability and now we're getting some weird moralising against creating simple, fun, narratively thin games. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'm sure most of us here got into it wanting to make the next big game and lavish in all the positive attention that sorta thing would bring.  Like making some masterpiece of fine art, or something.  But the truth is that making that masterpiece can cost you a lot of your blood, sweat, and tears.  And also, probably your time and money too.  That's why I recommended making smaller scope games at first, because you have to start somewhere if you want to make money with these games.  <br><br>It's definitely not as personally satisfying, though.  I'm actually rather amazed wondering where these indie devs I've never heard of get the time/money to even start working on these "fun" nostalgia throwback games these days, let alone get them to a state where they can make a slick KS campaign out of 'em.  Then again, you probably need a lot of shameless and bombastic self-marketing attitude to make enough of an impression to get the resources / get noticed, and I lost a lot of that since "retiring" from the business a while back.  It seems that sorta shameless marketing is even more important now than it ever was the more people try to get into the game;  but I digress...<br><br>In conclusion:  Bigger projects take a long time and may not pay off, smaller projects take a shorter amount of time so you waste less of it if they don't pay off.  Take on bigger ones when you have built up enough capital from the smaller ones.  Promote your stuff and don't be afraid of feeling "fake" or insincere about the quality of your work.  For small projects, it doesn't even matter if your "indie peers" see you as a sell-out, particularly if you want/need to make money doing this stuff.  The masterpieces can wait.  The bills can't! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I have a multi-level platformer (think Meganoid) nearly complete but it's taken me embarrassingly long to finish.  I think from a financial standpoint even that was too large of a project.  The Eiswuxe guy (eiswuxe.de) released Super Glow Puzzle in 2 weeks and it's done rather well, considering it took him 2 weeks.  As I remember he made 500 on it in the first month; even with no residual income you'd be doing $12,000 per year if you were able to maintain that pace.  Obviously that's not enough to live on but if that's baseline and you're doing better than that for most games, and you have residuals, and you have the chance of a runaway hit no matter how slight, I think you might be much better off with lots of small games.<br><br>The New Star Soccer guy had his bacon saved by Glow Racer or whatever the name was, a smaller title that did fairly well and made him some money.<br><br>Another point: with small games you build up your framework with each iteration, and you are able to run through the entire process, including marketing, a number of times as opposed to once with a larger game.  Arguably the other pieces of the puzzle, like business networking, building an audience and the experience of finishing a project from beginning to end are more beneficial than finishing one larger game and hoping it does well.<br><br>Probably you've heard of the story of the pottery classroom:<br><br><a href="http://pottery.about.com/od/apottersconceptualspace/a/apocrytale.htm" target="_blank">http://pottery.about.com/od/apottersconceptualspace/a/apocrytale.htm</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
