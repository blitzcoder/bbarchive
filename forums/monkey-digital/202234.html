More browsers are adopting it and with the integration of WebGL, accelerated graphics can be rendered using the GPU thus allowing for much better performance than Flash while using lesser system resources. Even Adobe themselves have started shifting the focus of their tools to garner towards HTML5. This basically sets the ground for HTML5 being a new platform for gaming as its "compatible" on all platforms as more mobile devices adopt it. <br><br>Read more about it here : <a href="http://www.photonstorm.com/archives/2759/the-reality-of-html5-game-development-and-making-money-from-it" target="_blank">The reality of HTML5 game development </a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Just about every game engine now supports HTML5 or will be supporting it. Flash had over a decade headstart to develop and improve tools for, while HTML5 was only seriously taking off in mid 2010.
