I don't see the BlitzMaxIDE as so bad. I don't need Code folding for an example. Plus Monk runs and looks the same on both platforms.

You need a code parser similar to the parser of Trans to get it right. I think the ones who got it right are the DELPHI ones. Besides that you can easily run into patent issues from Microsoft. They have patened that Intellisense feature somehow. I would be carefull implementing it if I would run a commercial project like Monkey.<br><br>3. Sure, nice to have but at the same time I don't see it as a dealbreaker. <br><br>4. I am happy that there is a decent and default editor on both platforms. JungleIDE is not cross platform. BLIDE isn't. Protean isn't. So asking why they are not the default IDE's is pointless.

Both BLIde and Jungle are based in the same low-level framework (CK IDE Framework) BUT Jungle Ide implements internally a threaded-module system (a sort of actors based system) that loads only the parts of the IDE you're using, on request, very quickly.

Refactoring, Code inspection, Version control, all things BlitzMAX/Monkey IDE's seriously lack, that most competitively priced products have, and all of which are significantly more complex than auto-completion. <br></div><br><br>IMHO, both of you are correct at some extent.<br><br>Refactoring and Code inspection are, as complex code completion, the result of a complete and exact abstract syntax tree representation of the source code. Having a complete contex-based code completion is not more complicated than Reflection. Both are more or less two sides of the same coin. Also, code inspection can be derived from the complete context-based AST.<br>The real difference on implementation complexity is that you can provide several levels of code completion even with a not complete context based abstract syntax tree, while you can't provide any reliable refactoring in this scenario.<br><br>In Jungle Ide, I'm still working in the complete AST as I'm really willing to add refactoring to Jungle Ide Monkey parser, but it's very complicated as the language evolves. The newly added Alias keyword is not yet supported and will force a two-pases lexing of the language. Also the addition of interfaces have been a big change in the language processors, etc. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's what proper developers do when new technology arrives. Evaluate it to see if it meets their criterion.
