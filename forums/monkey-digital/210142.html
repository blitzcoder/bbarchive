I play games on my NES and Genesis and the catridges still work fine even now 20 to 30 years later.<br><br>Should help stimulate new development for retro style games.<br><br>One system can be configured to "be" many different machines. However, this goes beyond simple software emulation and the hardware basically reconfigures itself based on what the developer has instructed it to do.<br><br>In a world where game markets are becoming so flooded (there were 174,000 games made in Unity and released this summer alone!) I think the RetroVGS will stand out as a machine where although fewer users will own one they are the kind of users who will buy most of the games made for the system. This kind of thing could basically be like a "whole new beginning".<br><br>Quality (as far as bugs) of the games should be better than the typical modern day releases we see where devs rely on continual patches after sale.<br><br>Finally I just am a very passionate retro gamer and want to support it.<br><br>So anyway check it out.

Slightly disappointing to me, if only because that means that retro sound needs to be emulated in software (or the FPGA?).  The music in the preview video for the pack-in game sounded like general midi default wavetable stuff :(<br><br>Everything else seems pretty neato.  It is definitely a "luxury" type system, or system for maker/tweaky enthusiasts, however.  Something like OpenPandora but with a fresher coat of paint thanks to 3rd party support from a few well-known homebrewers and at least one indie favorite A-tier dev.<br><br>9-pin d-sub connectors are interesting, but probably polled and not some straight pin through to an IO, which is unfortunate since no controllers currently on the market support that AFAIK.  (Disclaimer:  I'm not old enough to remember the 8-bit era joystick ports).  DE-9 is probably provided because it is the same port commonly used for the old RS232 serial interface, for hackers to make their own adapters.  Not as market-friendly, which is why I'm presuming they threw the USBs on there as well (Which better damn well support xinput compatible devices out of the box!)<br><br>This "could" work from a marketing standpoint.  Ouya tried to follow the "radical" fad where indie games were racing to the bottom with F2P stuff, requiring free demos and the like, and its business model was a failure and probably not sustainable for that particular market demographic it was aiming at.  On the other side of that appears to be this product, which goes in the opposite direction, providing the full-service experience, complete with cartridges to collect, (presumably) nice box art and labels, with a price to match almost certainly (I'm going to bet many games will be at least $40 for starters).  Could be an interesting niche to look into, even if it is extremely small;  the demo it is aimed at seem rather fanatical about their love of classic gaming and are probably willing to pay the premium for the experience.<br><br>All that being said, the release schedule is too slow.  Who knows where the market will be next year.  People have been predicting a crash in the indie games market for a while now.  Not too surprised that this concept was hatched by an SoA / Tengen alum.<br><br>I hope that they don't expect every developer to dig straight into Verilog or VHDL to work on this thing.  I want to see common system profiles and SDKs available freely to devs, so that the only hardware issues they have to concentrate on is working with the cartridge manufacturer. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This project has been crashing and burning hardcore, but at least one good thing has come out of it: kevtris is considering commercializing his FPGA board. It's probably not going to be designed for indie developers to easily put anything on it, so most likely it will be for classic gaming only, but if it does end up packing a modern CPU on the side ( again, unlikely because of the audience) using monkey would still be possible, even if gms and unity aren't.<br><br>This has also opened up my eyes to the world of Raspberry Pi machines, particularly ones running off retroarch. Newer versions of retroarch have a core which supports indie games made in love2D. I bet some smarty here could write a core which supports a custom monkey target; just a slightly modified version of the desktop target optimized for running on retroarch.  That would be pretty neat, even though chances are most people will never use it, if you're making free games then people running retroarch on their machines will want to find games to fill out their core system.

Free demos and trying to scrap up a living on in-app purchases is only sustainable on a platform with a huge audience, and a reasonable likelihood of your project getting seen.  We've all seen some of the issues getting our Android builds to maintain consistent and reliable speed;  they were trying to bill the thing as being a system for more than just casual mobile games, and weren't hitting the mark on the target for a number of reasons, not just QA-related.  Devs with business models that didn't reflect the mobile market were hamstrung by Ouya's model.<br><br>RetroVGS, on paper, is an amazing concept for promoting high-quality "boutique" videogames, and I fully support the <b>idea</b> it represents.  Unfortunately, it seems that the guys behind it have nothing to show for it but the molds for the old Jaguar case and a sizzle reel that wouldn't have even been allowed on Kickstarter since it shows photorealistic renders and not an actual working prototype, as well as showing gameplay on other systems, not the actual hardware (ie:  It's misleading).  Kevin Horton's the engineer with the actual goods that could be used to promote a console of this nature.  However, he needs to be pushed to do it, because he's more of a hobbyist when it comes to this stuff than a salesman like the guys behind RetroVGS are.<br><br>And yes, bitJericho, provided the FPGA has enough free gates to handle it (and there's a 1:1 hardware implementation available), I suppose it could use any soundchip the developer could want.  Obviously, at the time, I didn't realize that the pack-in developer wasn't going to be using any of that functionality.  It probably wasn't the best example of what this system's supposed to do.  Too bad that no game is going to be a good example, since <i>they don't even have a working prototype and the FPGA isn't even a guaranteed to be a part of the final proto</i>.

The QC would have to be done by the guys behind the console, just like the old times with the "seal of quality" crap.  Maybe as a condition of letting them buy copies of the game cart to be produced with the original jag molds, or something.

The technical hurdles having a unique platform poses also offset the chances that such a console will be commercially viable, and as a result also severely limit what can be made.

I am not against Indies and especially not the Indies who are truly retro gamers. I just don't want the ones who really could care less about retro stuff, know nothing about it other than thinking hey big pixels that's what it's all about and would only jump on it thinking this would be another market to port their games to to make a bit of extra $.<br><br>As far as the RVGS concept and meaning of it I am all for that. I think it would be cool to have a "new" retro console to get games for. Hopefully some "clones" of some of the older games as well as original "old school" style games. And I'd like to see the games developed more in the "old school" way. Back when people had to actually know what they were doing using Assembly language or C and learned the ins and outs of the hardware to push it to its limits.<br><br>I talked with a rep at RVGS briefly and he said he completely agrees on this and they are reevaluating their tool chain. So that is promising at least. They are also going to work on lowering the price down to $200 among other things. These will all help a lot and will address the biggest issues people had with it based on comments on the FB page and in the forums.<br><br>A lot of people like the idea very much and it did generate over $50k the very first day. However, it was about the second day things started coming to light such as hoping to add support for Unity and GMS and other things that resulted in people starting to refund so although new people were funding the progress slowed due to people refunding. I found out several days later and did my refund.<br><br>I think it has a lot of potential for the target market which will (or should be at least) small and focused and hope they come back with a strong campaign. I think they will. This first time around was a great learning experience I think.<br><br>There are a lot of people who enjoy playing retro games, there are many who collect them in cartridge form and there are many who enjoy programming on retro hardware. I like messing around writing assembly language programs on the C64 for example. Out of all of these I think there is a good market for it. I don't mean a huge amount of people. Perhaps in time they can get a base of 10,000 to 20,000 users. In the beginning maybe 500 to 1,000. The difference is they should be pretty hardcore retro gamers who appreciate the console, the games and the development style itself and are not afraid to spend money on what they want instead of complaining about games costing more than a dollar or two. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Free demos and trying to scrap up a living on in-app purchases is only sustainable on a platform with a huge audience, and a reasonable likelihood of your project getting seen. We've all seen some of the issues getting our Android builds to maintain consistent and reliable speed; they were trying to bill the thing as being a system for more than just casual mobile games, and weren't hitting the mark on the target for a number of reasons, not just QA-related. Devs with business models that didn't reflect the mobile market were hamstrung by Ouya's model."<br><br>There was definitely that too. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

No one, except maybe some hardcore fans, will get a new console just to play Indie games. Before that they just get a Wii (U) or even an old Nintendo or just play on their mobile phones. I'm not saying it wouldn't be cool but in my opinion any project which requires you to buy special hardware is doomed from the beginning. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
