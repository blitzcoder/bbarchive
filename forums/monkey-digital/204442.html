If you want to have dozens of instances of the same character on screen (zombies, infantry, whatever) then doing bone animation for all of them is going to have a significant processor overhead compared to using standard sprites.<br><br>Sure.. but I think most situations memory usage will be a bigger problem than how much cpu you are using - at least that has been the case for my project. Plants vs Zombies used an animation style which Spriter/Spine allows. That game has tons of units on screen possible all being animated at once - every plant and zombie is made up of a bunch of smaller assets. If they had done all of the animations possible as baked frames the game wouldn't have looked as good, it would have had a much larger binary, and it would have taken up much more memory to have all of those frames loaded. Just not acceptable.<br><br>There are still situations where using sprites makes sense. Like if your characters only have a few frames possible, you don't need smooth animations, and you want a ton of them displayed at once.<br><br>Yes! You should still use texture atlases. It speeds up loading time and lowers waste of memory also. Not using texture atlases is so dumb. Every texture you have in your game takes up to the next power of 2 in memory without using texture atlases. It also takes more time to load each individual asset, and if you have an HTML5 game each asset is an additional request for the browser to do. If you want your tool/framework to be taken seriously then you need to keep using atlases in mind. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
