They are staggering shipping, so I should be getting it soon.  For $100 it is practically disposable.  I think they are committed to doing it right, though.  It may take a little time but there are some great android games and many will already play well on a TV. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Or Sony when they changed X and O's meaning depending on whether you're American or Japanese.  To make the first real critique so whiny kinda loses a valid point -- that the semantics of O-U-Y-A as buttons don't really give any users, new or otherwise, much to latch onto in terms of mnemonics.  <br><br>If it were me, I would've attempted to assign each button a symbol which can be readily associated with its meaning, the way Sony attempted to before taking a hatchet to the idea when bringing PS1 to the US. (FYI, the familiar tri-x-o-square meant "view/camera", "no", "yes", and "menu", respectively, and the placement corresponded nicely in typical functions with its predecessor, the SNES.)  Perhaps there is still time to do this -- retain the colors of the control buttons for backwards compatibility, and replace the letters with some sort of memorable iconography.<br><br>As for "Needing a halo"..... the fact the console doesn't have a killer app yet is a good thing for developers who are early adopters -- any one of us still have a chance to make our game the one.  Once it's there, it should also bring in more sales for the rest of us.<br><br>The rest of the critique, I have no problem with.  I'm especially disappointed that they didn't put stops in the analog stick to prevent it from bumping into the removable plastic; that seems like an engineering oversight of some kind. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I can pretty much agree with some of the faults that was listed in the article from first hand experience with the Ouya. I was one of those 1337 backers and was even at the Ouya Launch Party during the whole GDC fiasco so we got to leave with the brand new shiny console itself - actually, i already had the Dev console so it was really nothing new. Just shinier :p.<br><br>Anyways, at the launch party we pretty got to test out the latest revision of Ouya and all the games that were slowly being populated there. Can't really say that i'm impressed by anything there, and most of the ones in their "sandbox" category were total CRAP. But there were a few interesting ones on there too. I can say that playing games with 3 other gamers on a TV screen is actually quite exhilarating. However, one main gripe i had with the controller was how sometimes the buttons got stuck... not a good thing at all...<br><br>As far as getting your Monkey games to load on there, its quite easy and usually works right away. And by hacking away with <a href="http://www.monkeycoder.co.nz/Community/posts.php?topic=4760" target="_blank">maverick69</a>'s module does get the controller working so we're pretty much ready to port any monkey game to Ouya now.<br><br>Anyways, its still a bit early to determine how well the Ouya will do. I still think its an interesting idea, but even myself am not sure of its future outcome either. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
