I admire the fact that he stuck at Fez through some very tough times, but I think after he released it and it was commercially successful he needed to step up his game on the business side. It's crazy and unprofessional to have a such a public spat online and then decide to pack up and take your toys home. Perhaps he should just stay off twitter, code instead and let his games do the talking?  Just an old fashioned idea I know. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
