I got an email that MSDN had the RTM of Windows 8.1 available to Subscribers. I've downloaded it and generated 1 of the 10 keys I was given.<br><br>When I try to install I get to a point where it asks if I want to Keep all my files and documents or to keep nothing. I've tried googling but can't find an exact bit of info on whether it keeps installed apps also.<br><br>So, if anyone else has installed it, if you select Keep Files, will it keep your installed apps e.g. Unity, Monkey etc!or will it remove them and keep just your personal files in the MyDocuments Library?<br><br>I am not in a position atm to reinstall/activate all my software simply because it will require a heck of a lot of time. Forgetting the time it will take though, why would it even need to delete or remove all my Installed Software to install a .1 upgrade?<br><br>Ta! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

At the same time, their track record for jacking that all up is about equal to their track record for doing it smoothly. I haven't read anything on 8.1 RTM and how well it does update. Normally when an update occurs, it only changes the system files that it knows about. It doesn't delete the folders and recreate them. Third party apps usually go un-affected unless MS changed something in the APIs they use in a negative way for them to operate correctly.<br><br>I sincerely hope they made it smooth, and continue to do so. On my Mac, nearly every update has gone practically unnoticed, other than the new features of the updated OS. Personal files and Apps stay in place UNLESS the support for them has been deprecated. At least it tells me that when it finds apps like that.<br><br>I agree with you that I'd be apprehensive about installing the update. I nearly always cringe whenever there's a new big update from Microsoft. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I hope 8.1 is significantly improved, though I can't see how it could be, given Microsoft is sticking with their ridiculous Metro paradigm. A desktop PC is not the same as a mobile touch device, yet we're expected to use the same interface, and develop for it as if it were? WTF.<br><br>And being a hobbyist "system builder", Microsoft's licensing policies drive me nuts.
