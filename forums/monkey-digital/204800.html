Just look at the Blitz3D vs BlitzMax posts over on the blitzbacsic community posts. But in general if you main interest is in multiple targets then just stick with Monkey as BlitzMax is solely only used on the x86 versions of Windows, OS X and Linux. You will also find that BlitzMax is hardly getting any updates any more. Though BMax does come in handy is you want to write development tools for example level editors. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Maybe Mark wanted to get away from the "Basic" connotations that Blitz had become attached to.  Not sure.  Either way BlitzMax is pre-Monkey, and Blitz3D is pre-BlitzMax.<br>Each one gets built up as far as it can go, before Mark plunges head first into a whole new area.<br>When his new language is still new, the old one seems "Fully Featured!" and the new one seems "A bit iffy.. why does it not do X/Y/Z?", but that's only because it's not finished yet!<br><br>Monkey's been worked on for a good few years, now, and so has been built up to a relatively high standard.  It's usually at this point that Mark applauds himself, and starts work on something new, but given the insane amount of updates he's been working on lately, I think he might've finally found a project he's actually liking! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

BlitzMax is better for desktops. It really depends on what your shooting for. But I still favor monkey over BlitzMax because BlitzMax is a (mostly) dead product, with no AppStore-ready Windows 8 store target. Eventually the Mac and Linux games won't be AppStore-ready because these AppStores are getting new standards and rules for app submissions like nobody's business.<br><br>It's only a matter of time that the BlitzMax, its games, and its active users will slowly fade away. But what I really hope is that all those users won't leave blitz research all together but rather head over here, buy monkey and be a new part of its community.<br><br>In conclusion, monkey is more worth it in the long run.<br>Time Killer Games Productions <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I know that quite a lot of the time its down to the coder to sort the problems out BUT there are some cases where a simple step by step help system to get something installed and running wouldnt go amiss.<br><br>For example getting MinGW working on windows with monkey isnt a simple case of installing it in some cases as I have found out, yeah it works 75% of the time but there are some instances where it will fall over completely making compilation impossible. On the laptop I own (Clevo M76T, 2Gb ram, Vista Ultimate), I cannot install VC++ Express 2010 as it gets to 81% and fails the install I have checked with Microsoft on this and get told 'upgrade to windows 8 as it seems to be a problem with the laptop', Once again if we are to use every platform perfectly we need a help system that will not only point us to things to be installed by guide us through the pitfalls of the installation so the end result is a rock solid system.<br><br>Without this people will look to other systems and ultimately will go to them, I for one like using monkey as its getting more and more the feel of coding in BlitzMax everyday but getting the system to compile sometimes can be a right pain in the butt. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
