So no matter how good it is, nobody is going to buy something they do not know about.  Promotion requires two things; marketing knowledge, and money - and I don't mean pocket change.  If you don't have both in abundance, forget it.

I'm not paying them 60k for this privilege. It's rather that we both earn: we 40k, they 60k. What I pay is opportunity cost - I could do parallel release, go exclusive with someone else, don't go to portals, etc. That's the real cost and what you have to think about.<br><br>If you're happy with selling directly, great for you. I'm happy with my business model. Portals specialize at selling, I specialize at developing games.

As part of the exclusivity arrangement you're still permitted to sell direct from your own site, just nowhere else.  Plus two of my games have now been localized - one is in eight languages, the other, ten languages, and getting that done didn't cost me a cent.  Localized sales aren't anywhere near English version sales, but it does top up the coffers nicely, so it's well worth doing it if you're playing the long game.<br><br>Personally I would love to have a flock of loyal customers and be completely independent, but right now the casual business model is working for me, even though I can openly accept that it isn't something I want to stick with forever - just enough to fill up the bank account. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The lack of funds to provide a living expense runway or to pull an audience via advertising isn't an "excuse... so they don't take action".

But I agree with Muddy, to be truly helpful, it would be nice to post something concrete and not just broad strokes.  For example:<br><br>In my experience, XYZ is the best way to build a list.<br>This type of email is most effective in selling.<br>This has worked for me as a starting price and I recommend cutting the price after X time.<br><br>I would find it very interesting and helpful and as much as you have already written in this thread being vague, you could have written up a small guide.  Can you post tips on how to make it marketing on your own? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This is what I said <br></div><br><br>Ugh... just to try and get you to appreciate where you're warping the message. Look what you said that in response to:<br><br>&gt;&gt;a market gatekeeper that limits your ability to build your brand as the likes of Big Fish do in the casual world<br><br>&gt;They don't no more than Steam does with core.<br><br>So, I was talking specifically about the relative constraints placed on your ability to build your own name, direct players to your own site or your future products. Your reply is that Big Fish "don't no more than Steam does". <br><br>1. I didn't mention Steam.<br>2. As quoted, you previously noted the large difference between Steam and casual portals in the very regard I was talking about, hence contradiction.<br><br>I hope that's clear.<br><br>As for the rest. If you're just talking from your own personal viewpoint, understanding that your choices worked for you for specific reasons related to your circumstances (hence making those relevant although you won't discuss them) in ways that don't necessarily translate to the circumstances of others, then there's no issue. Maybe you can reconsider your terminology when talking about it though. Much of what you have written comes across as stating that your position is absolute and any argument suggesting otherwise is just an excuse or a rationalisation of personal failures.<br><br>Choosing to go with a portal <i>is an action</i>. Doing so because you consider that you don't have the money/time/skills/contacts to effectively do better than they can with their expertise and resources to get sales <i>is not an excuse</i>. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I never got around to read this thread but the one where you talked about monetization. I first read the original article on gamasutra (linked from this forum) and I remember agreed with the Author to a big part. Then you posted here on the forum and in your google+ article, and you talked about an almost opposite view on monetization and individual's ability to make decisions that I found I agreed a lot with too. Your generosity in arguing against that author gave me a lot of insight. In the end I found myself with a more balanced view that was from "both worlds" so to say. I value that second opinion a lot. And so I probably also would have in this thread.<br><br>We all know there rarely is a right or wrong, because most challenges in this world have many complex dependencies. <br><br>I hope you keep arguing over what you believe, because it enriches the world that there is more than one belief to choose from. In the end we all make our own choices like you said in your article - it is not about convincing others or about being right, it is about giving us all more options. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
