I'm trying to find the best way to put it to paper/epaper.<br><br>Strange thing is that the people I know, friends and family, keep asking what has happened to me. I ask them in what way that they mean and they say I'm different but not in a bad way. My dear old mum, while crying, said she sometimes wonders if the person standing before her is her son. You don't shout, swear, smoke, drink any more, -You are a completely different person, she said.<br><br>???<br><br>Anyway, On my travels to find out why I do what I do, I faced incredible challenges. The smoking and disorderly,anti-social behaviour I disabled first. Big mistake. Can't even begin to explain why it was a big mistake. I re-enabled those behaviours in my mind but very quickly had an idea that I was sure would work which didn't involve disabling behaviours causing me to almost disconnect. <br><br>The idea was to identify which image in the sequence of certain though patterns was the  one that was powerful enough to create or to alter the current path of thought.<br><br>Think of it like a branch. Where the branch juts out eventually something would cause it to create a smaller branch/twig that stuck out and went its own way, still being attached to the main branch.<br><br>Every image in your mind has, and the best way to describe it is, a power meter attached to it.Then at full bar ie. the power meter for the image being full, would have the ability to create a new branch of thought or alter the existing thought sequence by being able to change every image that would come after it including the images associated power meter.<br><br>Hmm! well, to cut a long story short during these travels I stumbled on a place in my mind that was deliberately concealed but not by me. It is in there where I found certain images that helped me understand and eventually figure out how we see what we see in our imagination. I basically saw how this imagination engine worked.<br><br>It shocked me because; I don;t know why? <br><br>Even more strange is when I discovered how the imagination engine worked I looked within own belief system and asked a question?<br><br>I asked "Are you there?"<br><br>The reply was, well, I'll talk about that some other time.<br><br>Putting what I know to paper and publishing it would for mew be the best thing to do. With a completed publication, a completed science related publication, where would one publish this to?<br><br>Regards, <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

For you to be able to hear and to see what is in your mind the formation must exist, somewhere. You can't imagine something that doesn't exist. So, when you imagine, for example, a volcano then make it erupt, for that instance and time you were imagining it, that volcano erupting, existed. Granted not all of it was there and the reason for this is resolution. The resolution of our minds is limited to the amount of Neurons that make up our brain. <br><br>Now when I say resolution I mean it in this way; try to imagine a horse and imagine all of it. That would include blood cells, veins, its tongue; all of it. You will not be able to achieve this. Why? We do not posses that ability because we are not equipped with enough Neurons in our brains that would allow such a detailed formation. <br><br>Now, whatever it was that happened seven months ago; I woke up and for a few seconds I couldn't see normally and instead I saw what I now call the Construct. As strange as it may seem there is no difference between how we form images and sounds in our minds and how outside our minds everything is formed also. This makes sense and is understandable because everything, and I mean everything, at its ultimate beginning is formed the same way using what I call strange energy. I named it Strange Energy because it can be manipulated to form everything you can think of. The Construct is the same and is formed from this Strange Energy. The construct provides the foundation that allows everything to be.<br><br>Think of the Construct as the ground floor of a tall building. Each floor sits on the other and the the higher you go floor wise the closer you get to how we experience reality as it is so the top floor is where we are now in our perception.<br><br>I would like to continue but I am compelled for some reason to continue putting this to paper in order to publish it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Wich was a great advice, i began to stop being anxious and stopped thinking all the time (because smelling things force you to breathe correctly, what is extremely good for the brain and body functions) It was very benefical to me. I never thougth i was mad or ill (well smoking that much was kind of sick) and today I don't think I was neither. Those bike runs also helped me in getting a synthesis of my thoughts!

And they where all happy for me (and reassured) when I told them i paid the 35 bucks for this secretive discution with that "pro". What was instantly benneficial for my relations... because I followed their advice: "got see that women once, she knows what's she's talking about, and won't suggest you to replace some drugs by other ones"<br>So please don't consider i think you're a mad man. As I said, it's because you seem to have changed a lot in a short period of time that I suggest you to do that. And because it will probably help you in your goal of putting all these ideas on paper! I didn't suggest you to make a long therapy, get medication or anything like that.<br>That's all I can help you for, because i'm not a philosopher, neither an advanced mathematician, neither a neuroscientist of imagination... just an average musician/actor/cook/game making hobbyist.<br>If this is useless to you then, well, duno, maybe it will give some people the will to ride and smell ;P At least I shared what I though was "good" to share.<br>I wish you all the best in your process of putting your ideas and concepts on paper.<br><br>Best regards<br><br>ako<br><br>PS: I don't think I will write on this post anymore because writing to unknown people has it's limits.
