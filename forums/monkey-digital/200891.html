I've been playing with it and the interface, general look and feel, and the design of the interface is a lot better than my android phone (a Samsung Gallaxy) and my previous phone (an iPhone 3G).<br><br>It seems nobody wants windows 7 phones, microsoft was "late to the party" etc, but the system is really amazing, and the design of the GUI in the whole OS is awesome.<br><br>If anyone is considering a new phone, don't say No to a Windows phone unless you've already tested one of the latest. Really, top notch :D I supose it won't get a very big share in the marken anytime soon (if ever) but it's very well designed. It looks like it has a better GUI design than te iPhone. It's the first time I preffer a Microsoft GUI over an Apple one.<br><br>Strange days we're living... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Otherwise it's been all Nokia.  The best part is its different - looks different, works different from Apple and it's clone Android.<br><br>My twin brother has had a number of smartphones for work and believes WP7 is the best out of all of them (he had an Apple Touch, iPhone 4, and now an iPad2 as well as briefly an Android).<br><br>Some of the new features coming in the 'Mango' update will improve the phone even more.  For those of you who especially are social (use Facebook, Twitter etc) this is the phone for you with it's centralised communication hub.<br><br>Check it out!<br><br>Nokia coming on board is massive for the phone - should be interesting to see how it plays out. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The broken promises of MS and the providers to put out updates on a regular basis also have not helped. Stupid politics.  Also, the over the air updates used by Android, without using a patch program on a pc is way more user friendly.<br>Also, 'mango', with 500 new features and fixes sounds like a lot more than any developer should take on and expect it to be stable after deploying that update...  Heck, Mango should have been version 1.0 as it introduces features that should have been in there already.<br><br>I have stopped buying products based on their future potential.  I'll let MS prove they have something worthy to buy first. I'll wait for version two.<br><br>For me, Android is the way to go. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That's what I liked more about the WP7. Also, how efficient was the interface. Also, both iPhone and any Android can't keep very well consistency graphically as every app developer makes their own icons, and everything is set up in a single menu, unorganized other than alphabetically, etc.<br><br>All this is way better on WP7. I supose it won't get a big userbase becouse of all the hipe has been on iPhone and Android devices. But all I say is that it seems to be a very good platform and I hope it gets better in the direction it's facing now. It's a different alternative to what existed before, and that makes it very interesting.<br><br><div class="quote"> The dreadful upgrade procedures (my colleague had to tinker with his phone to get it in update mode at all) <br></div>I don't know how it was before, but my friend just plugged the phone on his win7 laptop and it updated the phone software automatically, without any problem. It just started the Zune updater, and it updated the phone to latest version of the OS.<br>Maybe this has been already improved... ? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
