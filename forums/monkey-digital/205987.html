The only reason I did this was because I was unable to buy and download Lion from the Mac/ITunes store.<br>The only problem is when I try to shut down or reboot, the machine seems to go through the motions and the screen goes black, but I can hear the computer does not complete the process as the fan stays on full blast and the power LED stays on and nothing happens from there.<br>When I physically power it off and on again, all works fine, but when back in OS X it says there was an error and to submit the report to Apple, which I obviously haven't done.<br><br>Does anybody here know if there are options I need to change/set in the iATKOS config that might fix this issue?<br><br>Other than that, everything works a treat. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You can then install Lion on your computer :)<br><br>Other than that, I wish I could point you to the issue. My guess is the change the iATKOS team made to one of the libraries isn't working.<br><br>I did a quick search on Google for "iATKOS not shutting down in Lion" (no quotes) and quite a bit showed up. Hopefully you can find something to help you there :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I resolved it after doing some searches as you suggested. The consensus seemed to appear that since it's running on a real macbook, to remove FakeSMC.kext, which I did after making a copy.<br>It appears my macbook can now restart and shutdown again, woot!<br><br>Oh the other reason I didn't call Apple was the fact that since I installed iATKOS, I have been unable to "restore" to snow leopard. I tried installing from the supplied discs the machine came with but I got a round icon with a line through, as if it's not able to install on this hardware. I got the same icon when I tried installing iATKOS ML. So I'm pretty much stuck with iATKOS Lion edition now from what I can tell as the machine refuses to do a fresh install from the SL discs it came with. No biggy, now that I've resolved this restart/shutdown issue. <br><br>I would happily pay Apple for the software, but since they won't let me install it on my old hardware, it's their loss. <br>Also, you can't buy Lion here in the UK from Apple anymore. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Those are the library files, but if they aren't just right with your hardware, it wreaks havoc on the operation of Mac OS X :( I had just about everything running 100% except I had to force my CPU to be used as a single core instead of the dual core it was. I still have it, and it probably *could* run OS X 10.8. Its really not worth it now. I'd need to upgrade the video card with one that has HDMI on it as the monitors I have only have HDMI or Standard Composite... no DVI or VGA connectors! My new MacBook Pro is coming at Christmas, so I can hold out with my 2006 MacBook Pro :)<br><br>I'd figure by the time Mavericks comes out, Lion will disappear entirely from Apple as an OS option to purchase. Actually, I was rather surprised that the option was still available when I found that article. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
