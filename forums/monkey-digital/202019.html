I have both installed in my macBook Pro. I am using my old Windows XP Pro key from my old windows laptop that completely fried. I don't know how Microsoft  approved it but they did. it's registered and activated.  I guess as long as the key is not installed in more than one computer at the same time it's ok.<br><br>Funny story:<br>A guy sold me this Macbook Pro 2010 model  for $220 because it was working really slow. Apparently, he had dropped liquid and he thought the logic board was fried. I took a chance seeing as the laptop was still working and all that appeared to be was that the keyboard was not working correctly. I ordered another keyboard from Ebay, installed it and wall-a a perfectly working $900 Macbook Pro.  So now I sold my old Macbook 2008 model making the Macbook Pro practically free. Got a better laptop and money in my pocket, all of this thanks to the magic of Craigslist! <br><br>Merry Christmas to me! LOL. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This might not be workable, but I don't know enough to not suggest it. :-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
