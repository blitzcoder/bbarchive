I'm leaning towards Monkey because of the familiarity, but last time I tried it for a major project there were many shortfalls and I always felt I was trying to put a square peg into a round hole (and it *will* go, but only if you hack off the corners!).  With that in mind, I'd also like to be able to stick with Monkey/whatever else I choose if I go back to the casual market at any point in the future.  I recently set up a limited company and am now 100% full time, so I don't want to have to waste 90% of that time trying to figure out something completely alien like GLBasic or haXe if I can possibly avoid it.<br><br>I haven't used Monkey for about 20 versions now (other than dabbling with Box2D recently).  How is it for "must have" features on Windows/Mac required for casual games?<br><br>Specifically:<br>1. Ability to change screen resolution.<br>2. Switch between windowed/fullscreen.<br>3. I presume still GL, not DirectX?<br>4. Querying folder locations for stored data.<br>5. Capturing window events; move, close, minimise, maximise etc.<br>6. Any support for changing app icons.<br>7. Decent file support (last time it was LoadState() only, which was a pain)<br><br>There's probably more but that's all I got off the top of my head this morning. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

About GWFL you cant copy the openal32 directly i found out you had to install it with the installercto make it work on other PCs. Anyway sure there isnt much UI lib atm but this is a question of time and to be honest jungleide is going rather well. I use a modified version of challenger gui which is really awesome not that i didnt want to use jungleide but this was simpler for my need and really fast but jungleide will definitivly be awesome in a near futur. Monkey is really a powerful solution the language is solid if your a oop addict like me. :) So no i disagree you can stillcmake things awesome with xna even if it dead.. it doesnt mean its crap or cant work. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
