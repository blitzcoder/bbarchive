If they can demonstrate a 10% FPS boost or significantly improved latency that could well be enough to persuade many gamers that dual-booting SteamOS is worthwhile.<br><br>Those are just about SteamOS as a desktop gaming OS though. SteamBox is a slightly different thing. I can imagine a low-mid range hardware box that hits the Ouya/Shield market for people who already are PC gamers doing okay. Being able to play less demanding titles and stream your existing collection to the TV has value.

Who freaking cares about another set top console?  But another software platform.... well, to me, it's just like Steam itself, when Valve decided to make it a content distribution platform.  The same sorts of criticisms, too.  "They're not going to displace the competition, it's just another DRM scheme, it's too wide a net".  What they're doing here is making an OS platform as a template for what goes <i>inside</i> a million different set-top boxes.  The same way Android was intended to do with smartphones, but more appropriately tailored to its niche.  It has the potential to be as big as Steam itself when it became what it is today.<br><br>The content of Steam games and the Steam community, as well, seems like it's set to adapt to this.  Valve seems to want to make it a community hub that you can get general entertainment out of from your sofa, and still be able to play games that mostly would otherwise only be on PC due to the relatively restrictive models the big 3 have towards developers, even today.  Valve has a history of exploiting underdeveloped niches like this (particularly, Steam itself has made millions for countless developers/contributors thanks to its platform and community features), so that combined with taking a page from Google's playbook, it seems like it's a pretty solid move.  They have much more to gain than to lose; someone else is eventually going to make the "perfect" steam box for them.
