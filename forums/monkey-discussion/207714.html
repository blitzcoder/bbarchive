The ability for the logo to be condensed to a single tone is a sign of its memorability, as OP correctly recognized.  However I feel like his design of a few spheres is not as memorable as the wider face we've come to remember and associate with Monkey.<br><br>30 minutes in Illustrator was all the love the old logo really needed to make it shine, anyway.... I never understood what people's problem with its "professionalism" was -- if you want to appear light on your feet you have to separate yourselves from your competition with your own style.  The logo was clean before and mostly served this purpose;  just needed some touch-ups if you ask me.  This 3-up is just a few examples of what the old logo can look like.  small changes to the face's angle, upturned rather than downturned ears, eyes brought closer to midline and increased slightly in size, etc. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

James is right, if the things being produced by monkey really start to shine, and people know that its made with monkey then that is a far better advertisement for monkey than a nice logo, the problem with it is so many people do NOT advertise that their killer app was made with monkey, so its a little lost on that front. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
