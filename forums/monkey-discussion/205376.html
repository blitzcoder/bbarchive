Monkey and Mojo are basically standing still (When it comes to realistic development), because they don't have a stable and fully functional foundation behind them.</b><br><br>I've been using Monkey for about six months now, and honestly, I both love and hate it. I love it because: It generally produces accurate source code, It gives me easy access to the main technologies I need for creating games, And Monkey's essentially BlitzMax with more language related features.<br><br>However, for a long while now, Monkey has seemed unfocused to me. Some things that I think should be community driven aren't, and some things that I think should be left to Mark are done by the community. <br><br>These days Monkey's pretty huge in terms of source code, and with pretty much one guy handling it, that's got to be a challenging task. However, that doesn't change the fact that Monkey has a ton of issues. These range from horrible development 'prioritization' to features we still don't have, but should have had months ago.<br><br>GLFW has been neglected for a while (Until V71 at least, but those features aren't 100% necessary), and it still doesn't have the features it desperately needs. We're just now getting basic socket support, but we STILL need an official method to change the screen-mode.<br><br>Mark, stop storing things in the "CONFIG.MONKEY" file; when it comes to GLFW and XNA(Windows), that should only be used when absolutely necessary, or for actual preprocessor stuff. The desktop version of my game should not have its resolution set in stone, that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!<br><br>My game should set the resolution similarly to the way Blitz 3D &amp; Max did. Having the resolution handled by the preprocessor just feels wrong for desktop targets. I payed for Monkey, I shouldn't have to do a bunch of editing and managing, just to have basic features that should be there already.<br><br>Having to edit code constantly isn't the answer; especially when all we want is a basic feature that we could write ourselves, but then would need to update somewhat regularly. Sure, Git fixes this to some extent, but this shouldn't be on us. Even if you think it should be our job, something like screen-mode/resolution changing could be a big change, and I don't think that should be our job entirely.<br><br>On another note, if Monkey's supposed to be as mobile-friendly as advertised, why do we still have dozens of small bugs? Not being able to properly close the on-screen keyboard being one of many (Which should be handled by the user using an optional argument). It's not like we haven't brought these issues up before, so what's the deal with that?<br><br>I love Monkey, but Mark really needs to get the smaller and older issues dealt with; especially before we get even more major features like sockets. (Which adds to the pile of bugs)<br><br>Other than its overall image, I don't think many people use Monkey because it's just so unpolished. (Unlike the Blitz languages)<br><br>Realistically working with Monkey isn't user friendly on all of its targets, only some of them. Though I love the "Extern" functionality in Monkey, making it practically necessary on half the targets is not the answer.<br><br>I admit, Monkey's "Extern" system opened my eyes to the C languages, and now I love C++. And I'm not talking about higher level functionality (std::string, automatic memory management, garbage collection, etc), I'm mainly talking about pointers, and managing memory myself. (Something I had mixed feelings about with BlitzBasic)<br><br>For me, if I'm using a high level language, Monkey's generally the answer, and C++ fills most of the gaps. I've tried C# and Java, but I'm against Microsoft's ideals, and Java just runs terribly on Windows; plus, you never have any control. This is why I'd love to have the best of both worlds (GLFW and STDCPP), without having serious issues about the target(s). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

As for changing the resolution using clever hacks, I've done it a couple of times, but editing targets and using workarounds just feels wrong to me, and it can cause a large number of issues.<br><br>I'm by no means trying to belittle Mark's work, but I think the community has better ideals for networking. Sure, standardization and collaboration between forum members would be ideal, but a lot of these modules work very similar (Especially ANet and my own module/library). Maybe this is just me loving how much control I get with things like BSD-sockets, and to a lesser extent WinSock, but networking just seems to be a bit too platform-dependent for it to be managed by Mark. That issue of stability and control is why I never thought <a href="http://www.monkeycoder.co.nz/Community/post.php?topic=5094&amp;post=56199" target="_blank">Mark would do anything past a TCP server class</a>.<br><br>And on the topic of features like sockets, it doesn't matter what our thoughts are about it being a good addition; the fact of the matter is that we still need existing features to be more stable, and we need smaller features to support the bigger features. (Resolution changing is one of the best examples of this)<br><br>One thing to note is that the module manager is unnecessary, but still something we've been wanting for a long time, and it's simple. The module manager makes Monkey look better and more manageable, that could definitely help bring in more customers. This isn't at all like sockets, where there are too many dead ends, and far more that could go wrong. Not to mention how the community has been doing an okay job about networking, but a module manager hasn't realistically been built by the community.<br><br>I'm not ignoring Mark's efforts, and I'm not strictly against them, but stability, structure, and finishing what you're already doing should always go before fancy new features that will cause similar issues. And if the community's saying that Monkey should have unstable sockets over fundamental features, and getting things done, then you've gotten to the point where you need to look at your priorities. Pleasing everyone (Without thinking about things first) is just going to cause more of the same kind of problems. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I am not a high level coder so doing all kinds of hacky external things aren't even really an option for me.  Resolution switching needs to be a feature that is built in.  We should have all of the features to write a BFG style game out of the box. <br><br>I have decided to just use Monkey and if I have problems getting the desktop version the way I want then I am going to use MonkeyMax.  I love Monkey and have gotten very comfortable with it.

These things are all very nice, but as far as I'm aware, the main features being added right now are focused on platforms which are expanding, where there's good money to be made, and where there isn't already a niche.  I'd imagine that BlitzMax (or Unity) fills the PC niche for now, and while better GLFW support would be nice (I've hacked the target, too, to have features I wanted), the lack of certain features are only "fundamental problems" insomuch that some people would prefer to use Monkey and Monkey alone for PC-game development.  Monkey's a multi-platform tool, though, and development priorities should reflect both its original purpose, and its niche.<br><br>Let's approach these things for what they are -- feature requests.  I'll throw in my support towards seeing GLFW3 migration.  A GLFW-specific module for things that can't be fully leveraged through preprocessor directives like resolution-changing would be nice too, and perhaps other GL-specific features like access to surface handles / extra blends / shaders / stencil / etc.  But to me, I see them all as "could be nice" features which are platform-specific. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Saying that you shouldn't use Monkey isn't a good enough answer. The BlitzMax target is unofficial, not so reliable, and it requires people to pay an extra $80. And using it on its own would remove portability. As for Unity, I hate it, I hate most high-level engines. If you ask me, they just don't understand how game development should work, and they try to spoil you.<br><br>And expanding the targets? All we've seen lately are things that could cause more problems that'll take forever to be solved (Due to "lack of communication" apparently). Mark needs to hold off on new features for a little bit, so he can actually finish what he started; if that happens, we'll actually have stability, and Monkey will be a lot more of a finished project.<br><br>You know, stability; where you don't have ridiculous limitations that wouldn't be there if you did it yourself, but you can't because Monkey can change drastically (As it should). At this point, we still have bugs like on-screen keyboards not closing when people want them closed, these things could be fixed by us, but why should we be the people to do it? Mark started it, so he should at least try to iron out the problems. But, I haven't even seen him attempt this. These are fundamental problems, which just keep getting added to a queue when we get more features that haven't been refined/polished.<br><br>Mark used to be a lot better about this with the Blitz languages, where he implements something, and then tries to actually work with it. Mark's essentially been adding features (And even targets), and ignoring them after. This makes no sense, because you just end up with a backlog of problems. (Which he'll need to look into eventually)<br><br>The community's been finding bugs and problems with Monkey for a very long time. The fact that we really need to push Mark to even look at them is disappointing. I'm not looking for shader support, <a href="http://monkeycoder.co.nz/Community/posts.php?topic=5285" target="_blank">that may be something we should handle as a community</a>. I'm just waiting for Mark to actually tackle long running bugs and problems with his project. But these days he seems to have no patience for looking things over.<br><br>There's no "good money to be made" when you don't listen to people when they tell you about fundamental issues. This is one of many reasons why people don't think Monkey is worth buying; it's way too experimental, even on its "stable" builds. There are so many people who were either turned off by Monkey, or are waiting for it to actually become stable. Well, if you want those people to use Monkey, then you need to fix the problems they have with it.<br><br>Cubic zirconium isn't diamond, it may look like a diamond at first glance, but it isn't. The difference here is that Monkey can actually be a diamond with the right work put into it. In other words, Monkey needs a lot of work, and Mark isn't working on the right things.<br><br>The mind set of "If it looks good on the surface, then it's good enough for me." really pisses me off. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

(It sometimes sets it to 50 instead of 60)<br>* Mojo has had plenty of performance issues on HTML5. (This isn't really a bug, but I think it's worth noting)<br>* I've had the colors of some images be completely broken and washed out if I use SetColor() with Flash (And sometimes HTML5)<br>* EnableKeyboard doesn't disable when hitting the keyboard close button. I know this is an issue on Android at least. (I think this should be a toggle-able feature)<br>* DrawText has horrible performance on half of the targets (Not really a bug, but worth looking into)<br>* Using HideCursor() with GLFW makes things break, and it thinks your desktop goes on forever.<br>* HideCursor() has similar, but less annoying issues with XNA (Windows).<br>* Clicking anywhere on a GLFW window makes it lock your cursor, so you can't move the window properly.<br>* I've seen some small floating point issues while rendering on some targets.<br>* Sometimes I wonder if GLFW's garbage collector even works.<br>* For some reason when I use MouseHit/TouchHit on mobile devices (Android), it counts as a click, then moves.<br>* DataBuffer.Load() has been known to have issues with files around 2KB for me.<br>* Filtered mode on some of the targets can screw up entirely.<br>* Some devices can't change the orientation to be upside-down portrait. (This one isn't such a big deal)<br>* Just about anything in the bug reports section that hasn't been answered.<br><br>And then there's the features we really can't live without, but there aren't too many of those, just enough to be worth noting.<br><br>These are by no means all of them, but here's a decent few:<br>* Resolution/Screen-mode changing (Desktop targets mainly)<br>* We still don't have a simple way to make our own image loaders (Without doing it from scratch, or having to maintain it constantly) And if we do, I certainly haven't heard about it.<br>* Simple shader support, <a href="http://monkeycoder.co.nz/Community/posts.php?topic=5285" target="_blank">but I honestly think we should handle that</a>.<br>* Support for Millisecs() in the OS module for STDCPP (Which I have done, and it takes two seconds to add)<br>* Bluetooth controller support for Android and/or iOS (Not sure if this is available yet.)<br>* A better way to debug Android programs. (Not exactly necessary, but useful)<br>* Multi-platform sockets. This is something I think the community should do. And technically we already have them via PushButton. But come on guys, do you hate UDP that much? My library and ANet are the only unofficial UDP-capable libraries/modules for Monkey.<br>* An optional console like what BlitzMax did with "GUI build".<br>* An 'inlining' pass for Monkey itself before 'Trans' compiles/converts everything.<br>* Some kind of proper pointer access. (I know this isn't going to happen, but a guy can dream, right?)<br>* A proper GUI library, so Ted can be done completely via Monkey. (I doubt this will happen, and I honestly wouldn't want it for a while, but Mark is trying to move a lot of his old code to Monkey.)<br>* Supposedly there were some Windows 8 multi-touch issues, but I'm not sure if Mark fixed them yet.<br>* The ability to properly disable V-SYNC on most of the targets.<br>* Better documentation about threads with Monkey (Especially with how it works under the hood).<br>* Other kinds of integer data types. (Byte, Short, Long) This may be possible with a bit of work. (For example, you could use bitwise AND for capping smaller integers on targets that don't support them natively)<br>* The ability to make integers unsigned.<br>* We need Sleep/Delay to be added to the OS module, or even Mojo. C# has this functionality as well, and it can be done via System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(MS), I've added this to my own projects before.<br>* A few things here and there that I've heard about on the forums.<br>* And of course, GLFW3 support just got added to the backlog.<br><br>Half of these are feature requests, however, they are relatively basic. Most of these are crucial for Monkey games to be realistically developed. Unlike something like sockets, where it's more of an afterthought. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Monkey has needed a lot of things, and jumping to new features instead of looking at the problems is not the answer.<br><br>Monkey is marketed as a cross-platform development tool, and I expect Mark to hold up his end of the bargain. Ignoring GLFW, and forcing people to use an unofficial target like MonkeyMax (BlitzMax) is just a bad thing, and you can't deny that.<br><br>And by the way, if Monkey is really as mobile-oriented as some people say, why is GLFW the only target with a decent debugger? Sure, I'll say this, it's generally modeled after a lot of mobile oriented code, but if Mark works on GLFW, it could easily hold its own as a desktop development tool.<br><br>In conclusion, read some of my other posts if you're going to reply to me, because it looks like you didn't. People gave me responses, and some even asked for a response, so I gave them responses; that itself doesn't make me mad at all, but I'm not exactly happy with Mark's methods. And how is being mad even a bad thing? Venting anger tends to be really healthy for people, and I'm no exception.<br><br>As for the whole Unity thing, I dislike it for a large number of reasons, but getting into that would mean a new topic, and I just can't be bothered. And I'd say you'd dislike Unity about as much as I do if you fell in love with the capabilities of lower-level languages. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This could also be said about some of the features added to the mobile platform, but mobile is where Monkey has found its niche -- not XNA or GLFW.    <br><br>Several of your feature requests would only be able to be incorporated consistently on a single target, like glfw, or would require a serious undertaking that would take away precious time better served fixing bugs or improving the <i>multiplatform</i> functionality.  If you insisted, I'm sure I could pick through the list one-by-one to elaborate on this.<br><br>Furthermore, things like floating-point roundoff error are left undefined by monkey and are implemented by the target -- that, much of Monkey's "lack of functionality" on desktop, etc. are some of the side-effects of cross-platform compiling, and come with the territory if one is to maintain a consistent standard library.  This is especially true for languages hoping to avoid the mess that is C/C++ standard includes by the time it reaches maturity.<br><br>To answer your question about GLFW debugging -- this was simply the most convenient target to add debugging.  Development takes place on the desktop, so it would make sense that debugging can be achieved the easiest there.  Debugging is still pretty good on mobile, especially Android, where developers have access to DDMS and can use it to retrieve debug messages and profile memory usage.<br><br>The way I see it, Mark's priorities when adding features to Monkey appear to first go towards functionality that can be applied to (nearly) all targets, and then after that towards functionality which would monetize projects quickest for the majority of Monkey's core userbase.  I can't speak for him, though, so this is only a presumption.  There's no reason you can't use the right tool for the job if you don't think Monkey's that tool, though. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

As it is right now it's perfect for mobile and web but BlitzMax is the best choice for desktop apps.<br><br>At the moment I am writing a game in monke and BlitzMax at the same time because I want the desktop version to be 'Casual Portal Ready'<br>Luckily the logic code between both versions is pretty identical, but monkey does a lot of things much nicer than BlitzMax does, it would be great to use monkey for everything. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

To support a target you need to support the expected basic features regardless of whether they are common to all. This is why, for example, we have joypad, physical keyboard and touch support even though any one of them may not be present on a given target. Resolution switching and windowed mode are expected basics in desktop games.<br><br>What most of these threads have in common is that everyone has to speculate if a feature is in progress, on a todo list, in a "never" bin or is even something that Mark has considered. There's no visible roadmap, priority list or even a stated philosophy to refer to. In the past Mark has brushed off feature requests as low priority and then turned around and implemented them shortly after (you have to imagine that these things magically move from low to high value when he works out how to do them).<br><br>If there was a publicly visible feature request tracker to refer to people would at least be able to see that a given desire was represented. Votes could be cast, priorities and intended delivery cycles presented, discussions about merit and implementation details organised usefully. Perhaps it might serve to reduce angst from those waiting for Monkey to support something they need and avoid these sorts of threads popping up on a regular basis. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
