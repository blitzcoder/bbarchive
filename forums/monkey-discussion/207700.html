For example (and no I'm not writing a Texas Hold'em game), Hold'em was argued in the USA when it was banned that it wasn't gambling, but it was a game of skill, the government did not see it this way.  In the same way, I guess you could say any game with a high score table is a game of skill.  <br><br>The idea I was leaning towards was this : players receive points/exp/whatever for playing, they can then choose how many of these points to put into the weekly/monthly draw.  The more points they contribute, the more chance of receiving a prize at the random draw.  The player can only get points by playing the game, and they don't necessarily need to spend any money to earn points, those those who pay for the ad free app may get some bonus points.  In other words, they can't "buy" points, but they may be able to increase their points potential by buying the app or buying additional content.   <br><br>I'm still not 100% on this, just exploring the idea. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Generate X amount of 'chests' containing random (non-monetary!) rewards every month based on profitability<br>2. Sell the chests for bonus points that are got by playing etc.<br><br>Of course the case can always be made that any random reward constitutes gambling, but then the whole of gaming becomes a grey area.  In truth people know what gambling is when they see it.  Random chests bought for real money will trigger that perception, but I don't think random chests bought for bonus points will. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So if someone chooses to spend money to increase their chances of winning a small prize over people who choose not to pay - not everyone is gambling.  <br><br>I should also add that this line of thinking is just a way to differentiate my game from other similar products, I'm not looking to bleed money from gamer's, just "encourage" them to spend on average $1-$2 for my game instead of going for the free to own games and in return offer them a chance at getting some cash back.<br><br>But yeah, it is a very grey area I'm looking into, and I would probably be best steering clear of it without spend a huge amount of money on legal advice (which I'm not going to do). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Do you expect users to give you their bank details? Sign up for Paypal/other account? Are you going to send them a cheque?<br>* You come under scrutiny of law. Gambling laws may be less of a concern than tax and money laundering regulations.<br>* You become a target for real money fraud. People hacking about to top GameCenter scoreboards is common enough. If there's cash involved you can bet they'll be much keener to cheat. You'll be hacked, botted and exploited at every opportunity.<br>* Related to above, with money involved your player base will be less forgiving of perceptions of cheating or unfairness. You can expect accusations of scamming to follow you around.<br>* Also related to above if you're planning on raising money via advertising then you might find problems if it starts to look like your users are being incentivised to click on ads or if your users are botting.<br><br>That's not to say that it can't be done successfully but it doesn't seem a sensible route for a small/inexperienced dev to go down. If the cash prizes are peripheral then the effort involved in offering them seems not worthwhile and if you make them a central selling point then they'd need to be large enough to attract all the problems above in spades. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Given me some stuff to think about.  The Hacking issue was one I was definitely aware of and was trying to think my way around.<br> <br>On the subject of bots, how hard are they to make for Android/iPad devices?  Doing it for a Windows based PC (HTML, Flash etc) is relatively simple, I wasn't so sure about tablets.  Can you write an App that will launch and self play another App?  I'd imagine it's possible, but definitely not as easy for PC's - and unless big money is involved in prizes then I couldn't imagine too many people trying.<br><br>I also did figure about the "paid advertising adding to the pool" might cause a problem.  I guess the easy answer here would be, no prizes for people using the ad. version of the app and no money made from advertising is to be added to the pool.   <br><br>Anyway, I'll keep thinking things over.  My game is adding enough to be different to others on the market, just thinking out loud about other ways to differentiate my game and hopefully grab some more users. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
