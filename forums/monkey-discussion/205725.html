I'll just install that then. <br></div>If your just trying out Monkey then yes, but remember not to expect it to be lighting fast running as a virtual machine. If you plan on releasing binaries that are going to target both the 32bit and 64bit OS's. Then you will need to use the 64bit OS and set it up in such away that you can compile and run binaries for both architectures. If I remember Flash SDK also needs some 32bit libraries to be present.<br><br>One problem in doing a cross glfw compilation with Monkey is that as there is no way to tell the compiler from within Monkey as to which architecture you wish to build, so your basically stuck with modifying the Makefile directley in targets/glfw/template/gcc_linux and adding or removing the -m32 option switch to CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS. Another thing to remember is, that any previous .build directory has to be removed. It is possible just change the makefiles in the .build directory but you have to make sure that all object files with the .o extension are removed or the linker has a fit. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In the late 80s a lot of trojan exploits involved getting root to go to a certain directory where there was a doctored binary for ls.  He would type ls to see what was there, and unintentionally run your binary or shellscript with root privileges which would own the system, delete itself and run the real ls command, leaving root none the wiser.<br><br>Dawlane:  you never heard of it because it stopped happening around 25 years ago.
