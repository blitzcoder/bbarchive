Here are some ideas:<br><br>*  Setting up a state machine in Monkey and how to allocate assets during the game.  Explaining when storing everything in memory is most preferable vs. when to load assets at runtime.  Explaining asynchronous asset loading operations and where/how to take advantage of them.  Explaining how to write a loading screen, and proper use of OnLoading().<br><br>* IAP.  How it works on the various supported platforms.  This is a fairly new thing and may be a bit more confusing to some users than adMob.  There are several android seminars on IAP best practices which you can nick some of the ideas off of.  IOS might do IAP somewhat differently but a lot of things Android "encourages" in its API style should probably be done on the IOS side too (mainly things that are done to keep the game from taking the user's money without giving them the product)<br><br>* Best practices for optimizing your game for mobile platforms, with detailed explanations as to what each practice does to help and <i>why</i> it helps.  <br>Examples: Reduce string manipulations per loop, use stringbuilders, use texture atlases, keep textures within a certain maximum size, how to organize sheets of textures to reduce GPU thrash, limiting the use of certain blending modes per platform, explaining the limits of Mojo audio, how to organize sounds to reduce heap stress on the SoundPool (Android only; there's a 1mb limit which is extremely small), etc.  Basically, how to keep your games running at a smooth 60FPS, wherever possible.<br><br>* Techniques for handling situations with large amounts of objects.  Y-Sorting is probably the easiest thing to cover;  but particularly, different techniques for handling large amounts of collision and/or tile mapping and culling the amount of checks/blits needed for these.  It would be nice to see more than one technique explained for these things, for example, Quadtrees/AVLtrees vs Spacial Hashing/Partitioning/r-trees in collision detection, phases of culling and difficulty vs. efficiency vs. necessity, ways to handle offscreen behavior like collision, AI and tile mapping, and so on.<br><br>* Explaining where Lists are better than Arrays and vice versa, and when to use Stacks over either, particularly because the access and allocation complexity for the various containers is not explained very well in the official manual.  You can use big-O notation for this but be aware that certain containers seem to use a different technique than the obvious (eg: Map uses red-black trees, Stack is actually more like a dynamic array than a Stack, etc.).  Goes a lot towards the previous thing about handling large amounts of objects for various situations.<br><br>* Using mobile devices' various sensors to improve the control experience.  Best multitouch practices.  Knowing the caveats of cheap phones' multitouch sensors (some have small amounts, some get confused which finger's which when axises swap) and working around them.  Understanding generalized screen density to provide areas that normal sized fingers can press and get the expected result.  Movement thresholds.  Click thresholds.  Filtering accelerometer input for a smooth experience;  filtering thresholds.  Axial assumptions of accelerometer readings;  how to figure out which axis controls the reaction you want based on the phone's orientation without access to the gyroscope/grav vector (a current Monkey limitation).  Describing/explaining an algorithm for 3d translation of accelerometer input based on an assumed device orientation so your game can refer to "virtual axises" that are consistent regardless of the user's preferred device orientation (think standing up vs sitting down vs. lying down). How to translate console/desktop control schemes to mobile gracefully.<br><br>* Explaining Monkey's scope rules. Differences between Local, Field, Global, Const beyond the obvious definitions -- how does the scope change within a class?  (Think about how statics work in Monkey)  How does scope change within a module?  Within the Private directive (for Globals particularly, on Class/Module level)?  Within the Extern directive? <br><br>* How to effectively use preprocessor directives and externs in Monkey.  Explain various approaches to externs, including function definition vs. class definition levels, how to handle passing certain types. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I think the key is for the reader to be able to follow the code and understand how to take each small code project and put them together to make one large code project (game/framework).  The final chapter could explain the benefits of using a monkey framework like fantomEngine versus starting with a blank page. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
