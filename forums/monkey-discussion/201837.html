I've sen the Blitz basic language go through several iterations, and it just gets stronger WITHOUT sacrificing simplicity. To me, that is the best in software design. Monkey has a simple syntax but offers powerful extensions to that base set (interfaces, generics, templates).<br><br>Not only that, but it offers the compiling and linking shell, which is very important to me. I dislike command-line compiling. Abliet, it was very difficult for me to get monkey's targets up and running, but after it was done, the iterations for compiling are very quick.<br><br>I still prefer BlitzMax, but the future is tablets and it's good to see Blitz/monkey keeping pace.<br><br>And above all, should another language take the computing world by storm (D2? :) ), Monkey is so flexible that it can adapt to it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

And today, one of them is developing 2D softwares for the iOS Market or mobile platforms in general. Monkey allow me to explore that new area without dropping desktop platforms.<br>The language also correctly evolve to a point I can use and understand complex mechanisms of more advanced languages like C++ but still let me accessing more promptly and efficiently to the "design" part of my projects.<br><br><br>3) It depends but: <br>- Easily use C/C++ external library (way too hard for the moment, even with BlitzMax)<br>- A true debugger (even GLFW only would be enough)<br>- Render to texture !!!<br>- Most of the current missing basic features of BlitzMax in fact that may one day or another arrive like it's the case for reflection and the debugger.<br><br>I also choose Monkey because it has always been announced as a game oriented language (even if you can do way more with it). <br>So in a way it would be logical to found more specific games functionalities. Like :<br>- Vector<br>- Sprite<br>- Tile map<br>- Particles<br>- Texture atlas<br>- Parallax<br>- Camera system<br>- Advanced collision detection<br>- GUI<br>- Network support<br>- timing/tweening system<br>- Shaders support<br>- XML/Serialization<br>- FSM / AI / Pathfinding<br>- Scene management with transitions<br>- Physics engine (box2d)<br>- Batch/advanced rendering<br>- More math and specific algorithms<br><br>Once and for all.<br><br>I know you can roll your own (no doubts about it) but think a second how fantastic it would be to centralize all this and having a solid framework to rely on and officially talk about. Not just piece of bits that would stop functioning one day or another because a lack of support. Plus it's not because you have one of these features that it will easily fit your own framework.<br>I'm waiting a lot on Diddy or the Ignition framework from Playniax, because it would give a perfect start to advance to the point: making games.<br><br>But anyway there is 75% chances that I will roll my own because I learn some good stuff and would rewrite my already existing BlitzMax engine better from scratch with monkey IF only one day every basic modules are supported. Not the case for the moment...<br><br>But all in all, like BlitzMax, all Monkey is missing I think is a bit of time to get mature and great.<br><br><br>And as a side note, don't loose too much time on Torque2D.<br>Why not taking a look at Edgelib, Flixel, Polycode, Clanlib or AGK ? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
