From all the available 2D engines I still like Monkey-X the most, it has a more programmatic approach, build size is small, good cross-platform solution due to translating the code instead of using gimmicks and it is easy to step into. I do wish that there were more plugins (e.g. advertisement SDK's aside from Admob) and most of all that they are regularly maintained. I like to focus more on creating a game instead of worrying about the low-level implementation.
