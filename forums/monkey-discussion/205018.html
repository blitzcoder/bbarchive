Then someone wanted to create a documentation site. But the problem is that not may experienced users are willing to spend their time teaching others. Look how many requests for this and that were voiced lately. And? Nothing happened. And I can understand why it doesn't happen. It takes a lot of time. Time in which someone could work on their own game. Time where no one pays them for.<br><br>2) Imho a forum is the wrong place, as you still need to search through its content. The order of topics change as soon as a topic gets updated. These informations should ship with Monkey in one form or another. Be it in the HTML help file or inside a PDF.<br><br>I agree totally with you that EVERY tool needs good documentation. But what is good documentation? Some don't have a problem finding the stuff their need in the current one. Some have. And then you have to think about what kind of documentation. Taking someone by the hand or targeting the (half) experienced devs. <br><br>Creating tutorials and documentation takes the most time when you create dev tools. And you have to be aware that you create it to be used by a user basically just once. <br><br>Again, I am not against good documentation.
