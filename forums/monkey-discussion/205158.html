Some interfaces would not operate properly without at least a few fields which are expected to be there, and it's a shame that we can't simply define Fields in an Interface, but there is probably a good logical or syntactical reason why we can't.  I'd probably have a lot more use for Properties if we had a Protected directive -- it is often a lot less confusing to the end-coder when dealing with 3rd party classes to only have properties exposed to them, which is important in cases where the Getter or Setter change some other state variables.<br><br>VB.NET uses Properties extensively, so I'm used to the idea of encapsulation.  However, newer versions of VS have auto-implemented Properties, which currently none of the Monkey IDE's have.  This would be really nice to have, especially when writing an interface that has a number of required fields.  <br><br>Right now, for large "interface-satisfying" property blocks, I encapsulate them inside a '#Region block inside the implementing class.  Each property I write has to have the getter and setter defined in a way that is more verbose than VB, so having some sort of macro to auto-write these would be even more helpful!  Whaddaya think, ziggy?  ;)<br><br>Perhaps, <i>starting</i> a line with "Property x:T.." and hitting enter can generate a getter, setter (Method x:Void(value:T)), and associated field (lcase and prefixed by underscore) all at once... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
