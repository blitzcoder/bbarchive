I dunno but it will be or will have a turn based combat system in it.<br><br>Any of you ever done a turn based attack system, and if so I would love to hear how you went about it, what sort of things or problems did you need to overcome, how did you handle the moves and timing of turns etc. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I remember wasting countless hours playing them when they first came out. I still have those cartridges stashed in a storage bin. <br><br>Years back, I tried to make a game in that genre but gave up on it. I didn't have the dedication or the skills at that time. Now I have the skills(or at least I think I do) but not the time. <br>maybe sometime in the future I will give it another try. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
