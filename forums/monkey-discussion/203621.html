I don't know the reason why you lowered the price, but you do not need to lower the price. If you are not getting the sales you want I guarantee marketing is the problem and not the price. You should post a job offer at places to find a designer to make the site better, or ask site owners of designs you like who did their sites. (Good place to find people <a href="http://dribbble.com/" target="_blank">http://dribbble.com/</a> ) Basically you need a page which people can go to and be absolutely clear on why they should use Monkey and be excited about it. Like others have posted above, we currently have to take our time to explain why Monkey is so great. Explain why everyone, even non-programmers would want to buy Monkey.<br><br>Then raise the price back up, and open up affiliate sales (BMT Micro supports it) and give the $20+ to people who send you sales. Then other people will have the incentive to do your marketing for you.<br><br>&gt; if a product is good enough it will market itself<br><br>A product being "good" is a form of marketing - the packaging, art, design, functionality, mechanics - all of those contribute to making it be sold. A product with mass appeal or social aspects built in will generate new users on its own - even if it's not a "good" product. Monkey is quite good enough already and it shouldn't have had its price lowered if the objective was only to make more sales. There are still only 664 registered users on this forum. These are not all of the sales (maybe some people are happy with the version they downloaded when buying), but still you can't think that marketing is never required if a product is good enough. There is more involved, and good marketing always helps. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I guess that is the way mark likes it. I bought blitz basic back when it pretty much first came out. Back then you had to get the disk shipped to you, no downloads. And it was like $29 or something like that. It was so cheap, I told him to raise the price. But I think the reasonable price will drive people to monkey. I mean, products like unity charge per target, plus they basically double the cost to upgrade to a new version every year. It is quite the rip-off. That's why I think the customers, ie you and me, should try to promote the product to others if possible. It's worth it and the more people that buy it the better the product and the community will become. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The reality is that if you have a product people want spending money to market it will make you more money. Waiting on users to spread the word can work but it has yet to work for Monkey. There are now 666 registered users (and I purchased the last two keys - I've purchased a handful of the registered users). Maybe this many sales is how many Mark wanted to sell and he only lowered the price to be nice.<br><br>Right now the Monkey pages are very programmer orientated and do not do a good job at selling the product. Look at: <a href="http://www.scirra.com/construct2" target="_blank">http://www.scirra.com/construct2</a> this is much more universally appealing, and their marketing works.

Lowering the price to get more sales is dumb when traffic is the same. Long term if no effort is done to market traffic will be the same - average revenue will lower. The Scirra guys are doing it right. They raise the price every year as more features are added, and do a lot of low cost marketing to build awareness and understanding.<br><br>I could say more but I don't want to waste my breath.

Maybe Mark is waiting for this future point to really make a larger effort in finding these new users?<br><br>My suggestion instead of lowering the price for life-time membership, would be to lower the price of a part of Monkey, like a target limited version. Must be fairly simple to automatically create a html5/glfw version with each release and get more people in through the door that way without almost any extra work? <br><br>One example right now that can be improved (imo) is that the demo does not update with Monkey --&gt; so frameworks can't be used by demo-users and frameworks can't support demo users. Because to be productive in Monkey from the start you want a framework like diddy, but new users cannot experience that and as a user I can't show code like that to test users (I don't even tell people there is a demo because last I checked nothing I had compiled on it).<br><br>And so they look at Monkey, find the risk to high since they will never figure out how good it is. And these are users that are directly referenced by existing users like me! Consider how big a risk random internet travelers experience. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
