It’s nature allows it to be automated via batch and scripting engines very easily.<br><br>It’s “page” oriented, meaning it will iterate through a given directory, including all matching images into the final atlas. It does not take into consideration sequential images (animations) nor grouping yet.<br><br><br>Monkey code:<br>There's already plenty of support for some of the output formats MonoPack generates (currently it outputs all supported formats at once) However if a specific requirement for a concise library or code sample is required, I'll try my best to come up with something.<br><br>Also if extra features or formats are required, please let me know and I'll add them to the to-do list!<br><br>I was sick and tired of some of the tools out there and I needed something simple and fast to deal with atlases. On the site you'll see the results of a small benchmark (over 2000 images processed) and the resulting atlas (scaled down of course), all in under one second.<br><br>A GUI is currently planned, but not officially. The internal framework / libs certainly allow for fast processing of sprites, so almost instant feedback is possible for a GUI, however we all know how much time a GUI takes to design, implement and test... So we'll see how much time I can allocate to this particular task.<br><br>I didn't want to implement artificial limitations on alpha channels or amount of sprites, I find this very distasteful. Instead if anyone finds it useful feel free to donate a small sum to help with the development of the software and it's documentation.<br><br>Currently you are allowed to use it on both non-commercial and commercial projects. Of course credit could be given, maybe a link to my site wouldn't hurt either!<br><br>Hope this ends up being useful to someone, I know it is for me. A polygon / vector outline generator is on the works for physic models and smart masking.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Gus <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You only lose an inconsequential amount of time for loading into memory in exchange for greater support on older hardware.<br><br>Closed source?<br><br>This is the tool we use for texture packing right now, and I'd rather change to something else, but still keep its format. <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/116871/Texture%20Packer.exe" target="_blank">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/116871/Texture%20Packer.exe</a> The key feature of it is that it's able to generate multiple textures while minimizing texture area waste. There has been no immediate urgency for us to roll our own solution. I'd only switch to something if its source was available and it already did the few things I need. Also, I'd pay for something better. A wish feature would be to be able to rebuild atlases from multiple folders with various options based on a .recipe file. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Multiple pages (or textures) will be supported soon enough. For now it's closed source but that may well change. <br><br>About the size again, not only do you waste time loading the data, it also takes longer to retrieve the raw information from the image (decoding) and needless to say not all devices support much bigger sizes. But again, I like to test with huge amounts of images and big atlases.<br><br>The code to determine the best size (less waste) is there, but it isn't yet implemented because I haven't been able to test it torhougly. I wanted to release this early on to see what your thoughts might be on formats, features, etc.<br><br>It's already useful to me as-is, but I do see a lot of room for improvement.<br><br>The tool you linked to looks nice, but it lacks a means to invoke it directly without a GUI (as far as I can see).<br>To humour you I selected all files from the test directory on my laptop (around 2200 small sprites). The screen froze for 5-10 seconds and it then displayed the sprites.<br>I then added them to be packed, Had a small delay... then I was able to click  "pack" ... I'm still waiting, it's been 5 minutes, entirely unresponsive single thread application.<br><br>Not to offend whoever developed it but it's clearly showing the same signs I found on every other tool out there, they are not responsive and they can't take the load of big projects.<br><br>In reality I'm hardly using as many sprites, but some projects do require vast amounts whether they use separate "pages" or one big atlas, the generation process (to me) should be as seamless and fast as possible, because you may want to invoke it as part of the compilation process or deploying process depending on your needs.<br><br>A good content manager will anyway attempt to read the separate file first, if it contains newer data than that of the atlas (or given any other condition), but being able to quickly generate the atlases is to me a very good thing.<br><br>I'm going to close the program now, it's been too long and it hasn't responded. I'm sure it works fine with small amounts of images, but it already requires quite a few steps from the user just to get the atlas packed and saved, specially the list setup. That's clearly what I'm trying to avoid on this GUI-less version. Input directory &gt; output atlas (given N amount of conditions and settings).<br><br>I've contemplated the idea of adding rotation support, but it will inevitably increase the packing time as it would require a heuristic method to assert whether the given alternative rotation provide a better coverage or not. It would however be useless if the packing occurs on RECT bounds and the image is square instead of rectangular though, as both orientations would take up the same space (same rect bounds).<br><br>Anyway thanks a lot for trying it out, I'll be releasing a new version soon with new data formats (including one for your tool). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Never really made sense to me why monkey-community people would do this closed-source business for tools like these, since there's practically no market for that kinda "basic" middleware.  Organizing the system by grouped pages would be great too of course, but the lack of this feature is kinda what prompts my personal request for open source in the first place.  That, and output formats.  Instead we have to choose from a number of solutions that can't be custom-fit because the program can't be modified, if you know what I mean.  I suspect the lack of open source in previous projects has something to do with the bin-packing algorithms involved, but I can't prove that... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This tool is FREE for both commercial and non commercial projects! I state this clearly. You don't have to pay for an expensive license for weasel-software to unlock limitations (I won't name them).<br><br>A plugin SDK will be fitted for anyone to add their own format, but as you've seen I can add them very quickly. The bin-packing algorithm used here is not patented as far as I'm aware, It's merely a binary tree. I'm not sure you'd be able to implement a plugin with Monkey directly unless you use C or C++ for the structures.<br><br>From my side, I would worry some weasel would take the code, change a few labels and begin selling it, which isn't unheard of. So there are two sides to this, It's not paranoia, you can also expect people to rip off your games specially in Asia and you wouldn't be any wiser, of course that's another story...<br><br>I would share the code with this community, but given an SDK and good support, is there really a need for something most people won't even care to look at? Because I see this a lot with open source projects, they go stagnant very quickly for the most part. That's why I also wanted to release this early because the more people get involved the more motivated I'll be to continue this, instead of talking "I'm doing this, and that, and that as well" but never showing anything in return (vaporware).<br><br>So that's how I feel right now about tools and open source, I might change my mind later on thought.<br><br>Just to be clear, the commercial tools available are not giving you their source code after you paid for the license and support is sometimes scarce. But my biggest issue is how slow and heavily dependent on third party code the available solutions are.<br><br>I hope this doesn't sound too negative or narrow minded, I do think everyone is entitled to do whatever they want with their own code / creations though, In essence I'm not saying "no" I'm just saying maybe :)<br><br>If you have a specific data format you require please show me some sample data and I'll make sure to implement it on the next version.<br><br>Cheers <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That's why I would even request open source in the first place.  Being able to adapt the tool to specific purposes would be nice, improving the bin packing algo for specific uses (making tilemaps, keeping animations together, adding priority factors, etc).  I was talking about the business of marketing <i>the middleware itself</i>, honestly. <br><br>If you're afraid "some weasel will come steal it", I have good news and bad news -- the good news is that if anyone finds it worth doing that, then at least your code has some value and I was wrong about its commercial middleware applications.  You can find legal recourse in a copyleft license, or a dual license, or just make your code better than your "competition".  The bad news is that probably no one cares to steal code to such a simple (in concept) application, and it would only be useful to other people who want to use it to build atlases for their games.  The only thing that would be of much interest would be the bin-packing algorithm, and like I said, I get the feeling that there aren't enough clever people on here to have come up with a novel one worth trying to hide -- If that's the case, then why not share it, since there's no good Monkey ports of a bin-packing algo in the public sphere yet?<br><br>With my OSS projects,  I don't expect anyone to contribute specifically, but it's <i>nice</i> when they do, and I am excited by fixes and/or change thrown my way.  I haven't come across anyone so crass yet that they'd want to "weasel" my code and re-accquisition it for some commercial middleware.  This is a small community, people would notice.  Not to say there isn't competition in this community for mindshare, but again, I'm not looking to make a fiefdom where the only people invited are people who want to do things my way or the highway.  I just want some respect.  Conversely, you'll earn respect from your peers by providing a useful service in the form of your code, and hey who knows, someone may want to improve it and send those improvements back upstream to you instead of keeping it to themselves for an internal project.<br><br>Anyway, I don't consider you narrow-minded for not believing in open source for this kinda thing, though.  You're not the only person with this attitude, so don't feel personally insulted by my opinion on the matter.  Even the person who pays me gets that "fiefdom" attitude from time to time with the code I develop internally and release publicly.  Don't lose sight of the goal -- the games, not necessarily the middleware :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Of course these are numerical packs, not graphical. Only the last step of the process involves the renderer.<br><br>Assumptions on a final atlas size can be made given a raw total volume of images, but it's not going to be an educated guess, the trial-and-error method just works.<br><br>Either way for atlases with under 200 images I don't think you'll find any noticiable speed difference using AutoSize.

The child class merely implements the New and Load methods to deal with the specific format, then there's a basic Sprite class to keep the data of each image and implement a simple render method.<br><br>I'm not entirely sure if using LoadString and the Split method is the fastest way around parsing the text file, but it certainly is a simple way to do it. Once I clean up the code I'll include it with the tool as a means of a starting point for "roll it yourself" atlas support.

However suggestions are welcomed, as always :)<br><br>Thanks,<br>Gus <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The "SeparateAlpha" feature has not been implemented yet, however you may use "OnlyAlphaChannel" to generate only the alpha channel.<br><br>Also heavily experimental are the MipMap options. The "ScaleLevels" option is not implemented, only one level can be generated at the moment. The other options should work fine. The rescale algorithm can be chosen. Alpha is always retained.<br><br>These new features are still experimental, therefore they are not documented at the moment since they're subject to change.<br><br>A counterpart to this tool is being developed, currently in alpha stage it's the Unpacker, which can take any sprite sheet and unpack it into separate images without any metadata. Very useful indeed.<br><br>The packer GUI is being developed, but due to the amount of work involved it may not be available for free. However the console application will always remain freeware. We're talking about a small licensing fee anyway, nothing we indies can't afford. A lite version of the GUI may be eventually available free of charge anyway.<br><br>Let me know if you find any issues or if you would like to see any specific feature, I'll try my best!<br><br>For testing purposes a small sample set of sprites made by Hyptosis are also included for the time being, these are actually royalty free as far as I'm aware, but you may want to contact the author for more information in case you want to use them in your project.<br><br>Newer versions and other relevant info may be found here: <a href="http://gushh.net/blog/monopack-atlas-generator/" target="_blank">http://gushh.net/blog/monopack-atlas-generator/</a> <br><br>Cheers,<br>Gus <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Glad to hear you'll be putting a price on it. Commercial dev is best dev.<br><br>Is there an option for output folder?<br><br>What's I'd want to do is "MonoPackB9c.exe sample output" so that files are put into the output folder. An option to override the config JSON too to define a different config file from command line? Config file should be able to select of which formats to make. I would like to not output any formats I do not want.<br><br>No multi page support?<br><br>It looks like if there is a JPEG in a folder then it's not probably being combined with other assets - it is put behind other PNG assets ..

The "Unity3D" format was implemented recently but it's not present in that version.<br><br>Overriding the config path is a nice feature, I'll add it to the next version as well.<br><br>It would also be nice to have the option to use a separate config file per directory, where it would automatically load the file from that path without user intervention, otherwise the default would be loaded (in case no specific config was found).<br><br>I'm going to take a look at your email and the attachment to see what's going on, I opened "src_full.png" and at a first glance it looks very wrong, Could it be a fault of autosize? <br><br>If by paging you mean one atlas per directory, then that's also planned. I'm currently refactoring some of the code to speed things up so once that's done, I'll implement this feature as well.<br><br>I've been busy with some other tools lately, plus their GUIs. I've got a small implementation of the "AppGameKit" format on Monkey, the code seems fine to me (I'll upload it later) but perhaps someone with more Monkey experience might be able to refactor it into something better.<br><br>The way you end up invoking a sprite is: atlas.SpriteMap.Get( "player_red" )<br>There's also a dummy render method, which for direct access ends up being: atlas.SpriteMap.Get( "player_red" ).Render( x, y )<br><br>I'm not sure if string maps are fast enough in Monkey, but at any rate if speed is required perhaps some other method should be used... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
