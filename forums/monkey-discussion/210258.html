I guess this Question should go out to who ever wrote it or who ever has used it , I will go peek around the modules forum after I make this post to see what I cant find myself.<br><br><b>Q3</b> Ok final question I think, I assume there must be a way to test steam integration and functionality locally before it goes live for people to download and or buy, how does this work, do we register the game on steam as being in dev so we can test it or something ?<br><br>Thank you to anyone that takes the time to respond and if anyone else out there has any other steam questions feel free to post them bellow. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

No, you don't need to add anything to your code to make it work.  You should just be able to distribute a package as-is and configure its deployment from your partner account.  You won't be able to get any of Steam platforms antipiracy features from this however, save for end-user automatic updates.  Even still, though, you'll need to be careful with where you save your settings so that they persist between updates!  I believe this feature was added to a recent Monkey, to make SaveState() conform to UAC.  It may require a precompiler directive to work.<br><br>2.  A couple of Steamworks modules exist on the forums.  Not all are publicly available (I don't know if any are available without emailing the authors) -- This is to avoid running afoul of the NDA for Steamworks API.  Do a forum search.  <br><br>3.  Yes.  Before you choose to publish the game, you should have access to a closed test platform.  I don't know the specifics of this (read the guides on the partner site), it may not be available to everyone.  Qualified partners should be able to perform a closed beta test of their deployment.  A quote from the public site:  <div class="quote"> Run secure public betas of your game. Hold public betas and choose from one participant to thousands, if you like. The timing and scope of the beta is up to you. <br></div><br><br>I've worked on games that've gotten up on Steam, but because I wasn't comfortable personally digging around in Externs and getting that stuff to compile correctly on a team project, I deliberately avoided messing with features specific to the platform during development.  Many small devs seem to go this route for the first iteration of their game, particularly if they believe their being published on Steam isn't guaranteed, which used to be a lot more of an issue than it is today.  So, I apologize if my information is limited :)<br><br>(That besides, if we really wanted to get into the nitty-gritty, we'd probably have to do it on the partner site due to that pesky NDA, argh!  I wonder if it's possible to start up a Monkey subforum / thread there?) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
