What I dislike is that there is only Mark behind it whom I absolutely respect, he's a compiler guru. But... One single person can't compete with large team. Sure, Unity is closed source but so what? It won't disappear anytime soon. It's a pretty healthy company. I agree that 2d stuff is a bit of overkill to do it with Unity but even that part becomes easier and easier. For 2d I still prefer Monkey but I don't start any large projects anymore with it.<br>The learning curve of Unity is not that steep, it's just different. Actually I was surprised how easy it is. For 3d there is no way around Unity if you want to publish for mobile platforms. And it's free. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Their main gripes about it being closed source is that the source is simply not accessible, and that there have been major bugs which have been ignored for years. Unity may have a big team, but their platform targets are still at the discretion of their leadership. Unity is still good and it does offer real value. It may be as free as Monkey to download and use in a basic form, but it does have a large real cost when you begin to use it in production. $4,500 for one person to get Unity Pro + Android and iOS targets.<br><br>We have been using Monkey for several years now on commercial projects, and for the most part all gotchas are taken care of or have workable solutions which we can put effort into solving ourselves. I am more confident knowing that we can build any target for any new devices or platform which comes on our own. We will very likely not move from Monkey any time soon with our commercial 2D projects.<br><br>Simply put Monkey is SUPER GREAT for 2D projects. Doing big, commercial projects is completely possible. There are many tools which have been contributed to the community which will give anyone starting monkey a big push ahead of the competition. For people who are hobbyists the value propositions may not be weighted the same, as they may not really care about cross platform, access to source, and other things which make Monkey a really good choice, and that's okay.
