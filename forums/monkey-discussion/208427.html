Yes it has it's drawbacks but all in all I'm very pleased using it. And don't think I've tried to use others! Oh no, I've tried almost everything out there, I even speak fluently Unity now, but hey, I always come back home. :)<br><br>I can't help myself but only here it "feels right". Mark, you've created a gem here! Please don't give up even though there are hard times in between. Take a step back, take a deep breath and do what you always did: Stand up and continue. :) Being customer #1 I will always use Monkey and I'm not shy to do whatever is needed to keep you busy. ;)<br><br>Oh and please Mark, in case you have a Paypal account, let me donate. I'm willing to give you a royalty share with all apps I did (and do) with Monkey. :) Even though that might be not that much atm but that will change over time, I'm pretty sure!<br><br>Cheers - Xaron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I am not a great programmer but I have my share of games that I have relatively finished. I do this as a hobby but I am also interested in making money as well. I know monkey can handle itself as well if not better than other similar languages. Personally I think its a great product that it's capable of taking me where ever my imagination leads to. Now the question is do I have the skills to make it do as I want. After all a tool is just a tool. It's up to the artist to make the master piece. <br><br>So for his work, I thank Mark for creating this great TOOL. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

By 3pm the engine was up and running and the game is essentially playable! I still have to add splash screen, graphics, sounds, etc., but the "difficult" bit is done.   I could not be happier right now :)  <br><br>Admittedly, I've got a lot (34 years) of programming experience, so adapting to a new language and environment is a pretty quick process for me. But I've found Monkey to be well-designed and the community help to be exemplary, so I can't see why anybody couldn't also get up to speed pretty quickly. <br><br>I also just want to add my 2 cents about drag&amp;drop scripting language type environments: they are a false economy. Sure, you can get some things up and running extremely quickly, but if you want to do something the designer hasn't anticipated, you're out of luck.
