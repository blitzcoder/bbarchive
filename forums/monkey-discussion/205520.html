Also, the demo doesn't really let you really see the cross-platform potential. I know its more work, but perhaps the demo should allow translation of all the example programs to any target. But, the demo is still limited, so you cant really compare to cocos2d-x etc where there is zero barrier to entry.<br><br>Edit - but yes, I do find it a shame not to see monkey mentioned at every gamejam/event!

Sure it was clunky and slow to use most of the time but some versions had inline assembly, the versions that didn't still had the poke command so you could get your native ninja on. basic was as basic as you decided to see it. :) now it's almost treated like a dirty word without valid reason for being so. Hell some IBM PC's had a basic on ROM if you fired the thing up without a disk. Personally I don't worry about the longevity of monkey and its basic like syntax because Mark seems to be one very committed guy and monkey fits into the market very well indeed, and it keeps getting better and more refined. coming NDK and low level 3D shizzle. Oh yes, the future is looking bright for those who discover monkey, and more people will. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
