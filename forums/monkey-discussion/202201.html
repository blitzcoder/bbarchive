Things that work perfectly well for one target (i.e. LoadString) behave strangely on other targets, while some things (i.e. the OS module) only work on certain targets anyway - all well and good as long as you realise that from the outset.<br><br>File handling is globally awful, however.  You're pretty much limited to LoadState and SaveState - again the success of which varies from target to target and loading any sort of raw data will give you problems (i.e. it just fails if your data contains a 0 anywhere within it).<br><br>I'm not saying Monkey is crap, because it isn't.  Just don't go into it thinking you'll be able to compile for anything right off the bat without any head-scratching/swearing/bewilderment, because you won't. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But isn't Monkey slow?<br><br>My sudden interest in Monkey came from a sudden chat with my boss last week. On Friday, he went around the office asking people for game ideas, it seems we have secured a deal with a company to make iOS and Android games, they don't seem to care too much for what sort of game, as long as we can provide the content.<br>Whilst a few other people were preparing design documents and ideas in Photoshop/Powerpoint etc I thought it would be easier to simply write the game in Blitz. I completed that on Friday and thought about converting it to Monkey, I have almost finished doing that now. My boss when quite excited when I showed him a firework demo I compiled into html5 because he was able to access it easily using his iphone.<br>I think it will have quite a big impact tomorrow on Monday morning when instead of a design document I can show my game idea which will be the full game.<br><br>My concern was basically now that it is almost fully functional in html5 and everyone can play it on their PCs or mobiles using html5, can I realistically put forward a proposal that I could make some games for Android and iPhone? I would hate to find out later that actually Monkey can't handle a specific feature and never will and then I've wasted all that time and money developing for a dead end language.<br><br>Everyone in the office is learning Unity including myself at the moment but I can't help thinking that for many games we could just use Monkey instead.<br><br>I have spent the last month or so with another programmer converting an Android game to iOS from java to Objective C and I can't help feeling that it would have been easier to simply rewrite it from scratch in Monkey. Especially since it is only a puzzle game. I could have probably converted it to BB myself in a week. Objective C looks very odd with all the [[][]] all over the place and it is tough to debug.<br><br>Dave, if I recall you made a Transport Tycoon deluxe looking spy game (or something or other). That was in Monkey right? Did you find getting your game onto the market using Monkey easier than you thought?<br><br>One other question, on the market page it says Monkey can also convert to X360?! Is that really true? Somehow seems like a lie. I can't seem to find any information about that here on this site. There are a couple of Xbox360 dev kits in the office and it would really interesting trying out to see if Monkey can compile to that too. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
