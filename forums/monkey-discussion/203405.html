With a few hours left their campaign has already received over 8 million USD and over 52K backer.<br><br>So why is this important for this community? Well, to be short, the platform is based on Android and very open for indie development. So a lot of the people working with Monkey should be able to launch a game on the platform.<br><br>I am not a very talented coder (I am the first to admit), but our games will be able to run on the console. The only *but* is that on top of the android SDK will add another Ouya layer to work with their Marketplace SDK. And we don't have it, which means that we don't know how we can utilize this great opportunity.<br><br>It would be great if the community OR better MarK S would get in contact with the Ouya team to get their SDK and get it ported to Monkey.<br><br>I love this community (and been part of it since early Blitz) but we are not that many. But here we have a great opportunity to make a mark. A console to be launched in March 2013, based on Android that Monkey can work with.<br><br>It would be shame if this platform (Monkey) with all it's talents (that you!) given a 7 month period would not be able to deliver some really cool games on a brand new market that will have a marketbase of approx. 57.000 units (based on Kickstarter data) on day one. Your game could be free or you could sell it for 99 cents!<br><br>Sorry for a long post! (Expecting a few TL:DR), but I do believe that this is very very important for our community.<br><br>Just google Ouya and read more about it. For me (a backer) I truly believe we as a community could add some really cool S*#t.<br><br>Chimaera out... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Being able to compile for the OUYA would be a big plus to Monkey and Monkey is certainly capable of doing this! We must not miss our chance here. That my 2 cents. Now the problem is WHO will make the target. :) Should we build up a community team for this ? I dunno if Mark will have time to invest in this, he probably too busy with the overall features of Monkey. Anyway i plan on ordering this console as soon as it is available. In marsh i will probably pre-order one. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Currently, the Developer backers have their consoles in hand with more releasing this month. It has a lot of nice features, while there are many holes in it that need programmed or changed.
