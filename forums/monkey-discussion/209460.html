The community could pick up the slack there but with the reduced activity from the sub-set of devs who contribute most you might end up being on your own when Google or Apple update. Apart from that the product proposition for developing your own project remains the same. If you liked Monkey 6 months ago you should like it now.<br><br>For myself I've parked Monkey for a while. That's not because it's not useful for building games but because it doesn't offer a great market for me as a programmer. There are too few commercial devs using it who might offer contract work/employment and the community is too small to support even the few people selling tools/libraries for it now. At one point I was working on an editor-friendly engine concept, thinking of re-porting the latest Box2D and thinking of how to generate more community activity and collaboration but the reality is I can't afford that amount of effort in isolation for likely no return.<br><br>I think it's still possible for Monkey to have a future. The Playniax/Jungle bundling could be a big positive change if it leads to a more cohesive toolchain and particularly a simpler and faster "get something on screen that shoots/jumps/explodes" experience. Devolonter's Mungo/Harmony project could make a huge difference by offering advanced, but increasingly expected, rendering capabilities if he manages to find time to get back to it. Upcoming commercial games releases that use Monkey could attract interest (although I'm of the opinion that this won't do much unless the product ease-of-use for newbies improves). In the meantime Monkey still does what it did before so no reason to abandon it if it suits your purposes. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But still build your games first, make games worthy of these platforms and you will find a way onto them.

I'm also in the 'took a break' club. Well, I've been busy teaching and doing some other projects. I started learning Unity last year, doing a few games in 2d, then going to 3d. It took quite a while to get my head around the way Unity works, but yes, it is an incredible tool. Sadly, part of my decision was the uncertain future of Monkey, and small community :(  Also wanted to do some 3d.<br><br>I do have some Monkey projects coming up, making some educational resources. Flash+html5 covers many browser targets; Flash isn't (quite) dead, html5 isn't reliable enough on old/IE browsers. Plugins/NPAPI being killed off, but Unity/webgl not a viable replacement. + Unity killed their flash version, of course.<br><br>Monkey will always suffer from not being seen as a 'real' language. I've dabbled with Phaser-JS as a way to improve my js skills, v nice framework [ incidentally, their website/community is excellent too]. However, out-of-the-box, Monkey/html5 is still a really great way to make 2d games. I still feel it has a place, but in a very crowded market. Still makes me sad to not see Monkey listed along side other game dev tools, but it shows the lack of impact it has made. GameMaker seems to hold that educational/ease-of-use space, even though I found it really hard to use!<br><br>baz<br>Edit - game jam idea is a good one to show off content and get the community more active. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
