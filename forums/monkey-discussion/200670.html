Yes, the developers have added support for several popular SDKs but if you need/want to use others, your stuck.

BTW, Don't know how hard or easy it would be, but I'd like to try ... :)<br>* It's small size (as in the size of apps produced).<br><br>Bigest Con: The name!

This, and my experience with other Blitz products, has me feeling very good about by choice thus far ...<br><br>One more "Con" to Corona: To create a device installable version of your app, you have to upload your project to the Corona servers, where it gets compiled and sent back to you ... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The lack of multiple inheritance or interfaces is a particularly annoying hole but there are others. If you're coming from another language you spend a lot of time finding things that you can't do in Monkey and not a lot finding that Monkey provides helpful new tools.<br><br>Personally I think the pros are all in the multi-platform approach and the focus on simplifying and structuring cross-platform support. The major con is the language, and I'd be very happy to rip it out and put something else on top of mojo. I appreciate that those who have been using Blitz languages before might feel the opposite.<br><br>Corona only seems to support iOS and Android, so it's of less interest to me as a starting platform. The other side to that is that if you are primarily interested in those platforms then Corona is obviously more tightly focused and driven to support specifics for those systems. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Now I don't plan on going back to use it anytime soon, because of several reasons.<br><br>- You can't add features that involve native codes by yourself. All you can do is waiting.And they are very slow in implementing features. It's been two years,maybe, but I've yet to see the additibe blending feature.<br><br>- Android support is very bad. If you make games for ios, there are not many problems. But tgere are so many problems on android that will make you wonder whether making a good game on android with corona	is possible or not. This ranging from slow fps, inconsistenvy between corona simulator and device, to crash on device without error trace.<br><br>- Many features are not fully implemented. Physics, for example, are not fully exposed to users. You cannot set a minimum threshold for elastic collision, which is a very basic setting of box2d. Sounds are still buggy. They have selective loading resource for retina display, but it doesn't work with spritesheet. And using spritesheet is encouraged... <br><br>Seriously, I gave up on this SDK. Monkey give me much less headache while I can cover more build targets. I there is no major change in corona, I dont think I will revisit it again. Using Unity3D with a sprite plugin is still easier than corona IMO <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It has features for resizing to different sized devices, and for iOS has a large feature set containing most of what you want to do.  <br><br>Lua is great.<br><br>The key negative for me is the fact that you can't interface with native code so all the new features Apple comes out with you can't use.  All those nifty open source libraries that get created for things like app sharing you can't use. You could go crazy if you pay attention to new features Apple adds to the SDK since Ansca can take forever to add them.. iAds is still not supported more than a year later.  They seem to spend more time and resources on marketing than they do in updating their software.<br><br>Another little talked about negative is that you have to upload your source code to their server for compilation so if you are not online you cannot compile to a device or the simulator (done automatically, but this is the process of compiling for the iPhone), and who wants to send another company their raw source code?<br><br>Monkey has a long way to go, but the reason why I am using it now is simply because you can interface with raw code, and you can compile to more targets. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
