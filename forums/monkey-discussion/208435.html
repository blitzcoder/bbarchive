I’ve created it shortly before Mark said that the Monkey development is on hold. Right now I have a plan of action and I decided to give it to the world in order to get some feedback from the community.<br><br>Firstly I would like to say, that this isn’t Monkey’s competitor. Moreover, I hope that this fork will encourage Mark to continue to work on Monkey. All that will be created and opened under this project can be moved to Monkey later.<br><br>So, a little bit about development plans. Project will have two parallel development branches.<br><br><b>1.x</b><br>This branch will be a simple support and improvement of the current Monkey version. Development of this branch will contain:<br><br><div class="quote"> * Add WebGL support to mojo<br>* Change Ted by another (advanced) IDE<br>* Improvement documentation template<br>* Rewrite bmx tools in Monkey<br>* Create standard distributives (rejection from archives)<br>* Small fixes and improvements of core modules <br></div><br><br><b>2.x</b><br>This branch is the next stage of Monkey development. Development of this branch will contain:<br><br><div class="quote"> * Create Mungo language based on Monkey <strike>but more python-ish</strike> (full rejection from Basic).

Monkey's arguably more readable than Python when using Strict styles and verbose block closure statements (End Method / End If / etc. instead of simply End).  Python's also a dynamically-typed language, which doesn't translate very well at all  to some targets, if that's a planned feature.  (If it's not, again I must question changing the syntax.)   <br><br>Several of Python's other nice pieces of syntactic sugar can translate to Monkey without much trouble -- the one feature which I think could argue for such a change would be support for Generators / coroutines in a Python-like way.  Honestly though from my limited understanding of the things, this can also be dealt with perhaps with a reworking of how ObjectEnumerators work in Monkey along with some extra keywords (Yield, From, etc) to step through an enumerator in a custom/lazy way. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I would like to clarify a bit about the change of syntax. It seems I mislead everyone when I said that I’ll do syntax similar to python (it seems to me that Monkey syntax has something in common with Python). Actually, I don’t plan to change so many things, so let's just forget about python :) I would like to change: the comments (//, /**/ instead of ‘ and #rem), the select operator to the switch operator, and  the comparison operators (!=, == ). Also (possibly) to refuse from End If, End For, Then, etc.<br><br>All this is done to make it easier to switch between languages. I write a lot on js, so when I return to Monkey very often I do the same typos... Also this decision was made because of a huge amount of negative feedback about Basic syntax when I told about Monkey to other developers. For me it’s not insulting - to write on Basic, but for many developers it is like a red rag to a bull. So as you can see this is not a big issue to support two languages. At the moment I don’t plan to bring more changes.<br><br>Regarding IDE. Actually I would like to write IDE in order to create UI module. So I could test the module in action. Right now I arranged with <a href="http://fingerdev.com/apps/jentos/" target="_blank">Jentos IDE</a> author about including this IDE (after some stability fixes) in the distributive of 1.x branch<br><br>About naming. Mungo comes from reducing genus <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrow-striped_Mongoose" target="_blank">Mungotictis</a>. I tried to find a registered trademark, and it seems it was but right now it’s abandoned. So maybe there won’t be any issues with the name. I think at the moment it is not so important... But thanks for the warning.<br><br>Regarding other modules. At the moment I don’t plan to create and refine modules like 3d, IAP, AdMob, etc. I hope that the community will continue to do modules for Monkey, so it won’t be an issue.<br><br>Small mungo syntax snippet (just from my head. I should think more about that)<br><pre class=code>/*It's block comment*/

At the moment I don’t plan to bring more changes. <br></div><br><br>Don't mind me saying this, but it's pretty jacked up to waste such an inordinate amount of time catering to these people's old prejudices.  They're upset over <i>clearly more accessible</i> syntax -- that must be it, because every other old critique of BASIC languages doesn't apply, and some of the ones that do seem to get a free pass with languages like Python that share those features (ahem, like dynamic typing), segue aside.<br><br>Switch statements have fall-through in C-like languages, so you're not making it any easier for people there by removing that than you would forcing some level of verbosity for readibility's sake.  Actually, Monkey lets you omit verbosity for block closures, which is a feature not present in many BASIC dialects -- Forcing people to use that, however, I find downright offensive, as a long-time vb.NET coder, I use verbose block closure statements to help find my way around the code and wouldn't be happy seeing that removed.<br><br>I not sure what else to say, other than everyone has their own preferences for operator choice.  I actually think Monkey got it right on Logic vs. Bitwise ops.  Straight comparison is fine, though I imagine some people can take contention to &lt;&gt; vs. !=;  that's an old BASIC thing.  I find little use, however, for allowing assignment inside the eval part of a one-liner branch statement -- you can always do this on a separate line, and it improves readability.  Maybe c-style For syntax would have more use for that, but then you start running into the Generator/Iterator thing again, and while Monkey has a quirky syntax to deal with that, that's one of the things that makes the language unique (for better or worse).  In the hypothetical future, EachIn could support lazy generators and Step would work with variables when the a full generator isn't needed.<br><br>So, yeah.  People's objections to the syntax are mostly an excuse, I think.  Everyone who has been around a while has encountered BASIC, and anyone who hasn't is either new or simply opinionated and have room to learn.  The same arguments though I guess could be said if the language started off with more c-like syntax, but it didn't -- Mark chose BASIC-style syntax, so you're gonna be making an active decision whether devoting resources to changing that is a worthwhile tradeoff for your efforts.  (IE:  Do you gain much more than you lose, on top of the time spent?)<br><br>I dunno.  I think I might be with Taiphoz on this one, but then again if I thought Monkey were dead, I'd probably put in a fork, too.  It would be an "with-intent to merge back into mainline" thing for me, though. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In any case, implementation of the new syntax will be the last thing I do for Mungo 2.x<br><br>Also I would like to point out, that all core modules will be written in Monkey, so they still can be used with it.

Stop(bla:Int) requires an argument, so it can't be called in the way you described.  In Strict mode, all 3 eval functions would expect parenthesis, because they're functions.  Only variables and Properties get that luxury typically.  Single line parsing should expect Then as typical BASIC syntax;  it may have been a mistake to allow omitting Then when there is no line break to separate the condition from the statements, but it's a minor point of contention with a scope of critique somewhere between allowing implicit type conversion and allowing type sigils.<br><br>If you're using a single-line If block, be sure to use Then, and to also use good (not lazy) function arg syntax.

Maybe you are right, but maybe not…Time will tell. Just wanted to say that many things were once made "just because".<br><br>OK, I see that this fork raises many concerns. Though muddy_shoes wrote quite accurately the purpose of this fork and reasons of its creation. Let me provide a few examples why I decided to do it.<br><br><a href="http://www.monkey-x.com/Community/posts.php?topic=3276&amp;page=first" target="_blank">Mojo HTML5 GL</a>. This patch will never be included in the official repo. Also I haven’t heard of Mark’s plans to build his own. But the issue is that patching isn’t the best idea (it’s not very usable). Currently, I wrote a completely new implementation of it with full integration with mojo. It still needs some work, but it already works 10 times better than the patch and ~20 times faster than 2d canvas mojo.<br><br><a href="https://github.com/blitz-research/monkey/pull/44" target="_blank">Meta data for audio</a>. It was important to check sound file exists or not in my project. But in HTML5 target LoadSound doesn’t return Null. So, I had to write a fix. I offered it to Mark, but he wasn't sure that it will work with Web Audio and the fix was rejected. Though now I use it in my project and it works like a charm.<br><br><a href="https://github.com/blitz-research/monkey/pull/50" target="_blank">Access to surface image field</a>. It was asked to do a number of times, but every time it was rejected. In my fork I can make it public.<br><br>So, it’s very difficult to contribute to Monkey. You can make hundreds useful stuff, but if Mark rejects it you can't do anything about it. I understand that Mark makes a commercial product and he doesn’t need magic bugs in someone else's code.<br><br>Eventually I had a choice - keep these things for myself or open them to community. And I chose the second option. Once it is ready for release and is well tested I’ll send pull requests to Mark. But I can’t say for sure that they’ll be included. In any case I’ll provide some manuals about how to use it in Monkey.<br><br>It doesn’t make sense to split this small community. I’ll continue to support my Monkey modules as well as to create the new ones. But with Mungo I can make something  more. Syntax is my personally taste, so I’ll use it only for personal projects. All modules will still be written in Monkey. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I don't see that sort of thing as an inevitable consequence though. To an extent I think it's an error to headline this project with the syntax variant label as it's really not the most interesting part of it. It would just be a shame if the baby went out with the bathwater and people shunned the whole idea of community forks of Monkey based on this one issue.<br><br>As I said before I'm quite keen on the idea of getting some sort of loose organisation for community dev efforts moving forward. One part of that would be creating a general understanding of how we might structure projects so that people can still create things like Mungo's alternative syntax while maintaining clear separation from "core" Monkey. At the moment I'm struggling to find a site/web software that would allow discussions around things like proposals and design documents. I'm not entirely convinced there's enough motivation and commonality of viewpoint to make such a thing work but it's worth a try. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You two are not your average coders. Your skills excel especially at keeping large projects organized and maintained. Logic with reasoning is key to programming well and efficiently and delivering complete games/applications etc. Its like a personality; Logic and reasoning. We are all capable of eliciting generally accepted reasoning by applying how we define our logic to it. Some people cast logic, in programming, to their reasoning systems with the intention of getting back, when the Eureka moment allows, an efficient reasonable bluprint/answer to a current problem that needs solving. When both the Logic and Reasoning systems gel together harmoniously we get programmers like you two. When the Logic and Reasoning systems are even slightly misaligned, you get, again when the Eureka moment allows, programmers who struggle a little. <br><br>The disaster is when your Logic casts to your Reasoning systems a question where the answer expected back is either a solution to a programming bug or just about a solution to it but instead you get back a recipe on how to make banana flavored ham. I don't suffer that at all...........cough.......anyway.........<br><br>In brief, you two putting your programming heads together equals, when finished, something that will kick ass.
