This is a drop in the bucket compared to the number of people who already have access to the App Store and Google Play, and we all know how competitive those markets are.

On the one hand I think the market has room for a media box that also functions as a low-end console. On the other I doubt that the OUYA will do anything more than flag that fact to a larger player. The OUYA console itself seems destined to be just a niche product.<br><br>I don't believe that the business intention is to actually make the OUYA a viable console competitor anyway. They're looking to get bought out just like most tech start-ups. Ms. Uhrman might talk about her passion for games but I think she's looking past the camera to her imagined future liquidity event when Google or maybe one of the hardware players like Samsung swoops in and hands her a few hundred million dollars.<br><br>The really surprising thing to me is how hard people have bitten the hook. There's certainly tech-geek fun to be had with a hackable $99 box that plugs into your TV but as a consumer games console the story is weak. I don't see how Canabalt is a compelling living-room experience and I don't see how much of the rest of the catalogue of Android games will be either.<br><br>From a developer viewpoint it makes even less sense to me to be excited about this right now. Yes it's Android based, but you'll still have work to do to convert (although Monkey users who have written something for XBox will be in a better spot here). Even if the kickstarter keeps flying along the install base will be 100-200K. You'd have to have a pretty big hit in percentage terms to get a decent return out of that. Also, remember that:<br><br>1. People know this is Android, so you can bet they'll be looking for Android prices<br>2. They expressly state that the software will be "hackable"<br>3.
