The entertainment industry (including, but not limited to games) is targeting a vastly different (and broader) market than Monkey. As I see it, Monkey is more of a business to business product, where the entertainment industry is largely business to consumer.<br><br>Is there a demo of BizTalk? A trial version of SAP? No, of course not. Why? Because as a customer, you already know if you want/need it or not. Abstractly it's the same thing with Monkey. The point of entry is pretty high (you need previous experience with another BRL product, preferably BlitzMAX, and you need to know that documentation and tool chain is something you have to figure out for yourself, and that you're buying the product as-is, with no expressed or implied roadmap of future functionality). What you have is what you got, and BRL are the key masters.<br><br>Is an up-to-date demo, or even a demo forum going to change any of those factors significantly? Not likely. But if you can accept and understand these terms, Monkey is an excellent product for the money, which is a trivial amount for a serious developer. The cost of an iOS and Android account alone are more than that. Add to that the cost of a decent IDE (Sublime 2 or JungleIDE for instance), hosting for your business site, software licenses for the other software you'll need (like Photoshop), cost for content (graphics/music/sound effects/levels/story/etc.), an accountant, a Mac if you want to develop iOS games, FlexBuilder if you want to develop Flash games, an iPhone and Android phone if you want to test your games, and the cost of Monkey is absolutely dwarfed by all your other expenses.<br><br>The main cost of using Monkey is time. This is true regardless of whether you are using the demo or the full version. You can reduce this cost somewhat by having access to the forums, where comparatively more seasoned Monkey developers are usually ready to help you. Insisting that this is not an incentive to buy is demonstrably false. I realize that personal anecdotes aren't data, but it's the reason I bought it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

To me Monkey is the user friendly version of haXe, and to me more immediately useful, though haXe can be seen as more powerful. When I heard about Monkey and what it is that was enough for me to become extremely interested and I purchased my first license immediately - the cost is SO LOW compared to other tools and softwares that I have licensed that even if it didn't live up to my expectations it wouldn't be a major loss, because I am very selfish and I wish to fund things which show promise even if they are not immediately useful. :) Luckily for me I didn't have to wait months for Monkey to be more feature complete and stable as I originally had expected and we're almost about to release our first major game built with it.<br><br>For many like me it is an impulse purchase... because it is clearly so great. But I'm not convinced opening up the forum will make things better than they are or convince more people to buy it. Instead I think it will just raise the noise in the forum and influence Mark to focus on things which are of no consequence to non-serious devs... and to me it's clear more people would just pirate it as it has no DRM and the ability to engage the community is the only controlled value. Say if someone does pirate it and gets into using it heavily but needs some help... so this community being licensees only is an incentive for them to finally buy it.<br><br>So... you out there who have not purchased Monkey yet.
