I've found out recently that very similar functionality can be achieved through the Steam community portal using the Workshop functionality, which you can see in action here:<br><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/app/214850/workshop/" target="_blank">http://steamcommunity.com/app/214850/workshop/</a><br><br>In addition to the previous reasons to get the commercial version of MonkeyX (or MonkeyX Studio, now that BRL has decided to team up to provide this bundle), that being the increased exposure to new users and corresponding bump in sales,  the community features of Steam could further help spread the adoption of MonkeyX by providing a way for users of the language to showcase their games on one of the main platforms they'd likely want to publish their game.<br><br>As a Steam product, MonkeyX would also get the other community features also seen available on the topbar in the link provided:  Discussion forums, shared artwork/screenshots (free hosting for uploads related to the product), video hosting (eg:  for tutorials), and so on.  All without requiring writing a complicated backend to provide this stuff ourselves.  <br><br>I alluded to MX really needing another community site which would have a lot of this stuff, to allow the main site to polish its sell page into something more straightforward, but somewhat lamented the fact that we probably wouldn't have anyone willing to put in the effort to create a site like this specifically for our community.  If MonkeyX were on Steam, we wouldn't have to -- almost all of those community features already exist right there.<br><br>Thoughts?  Please check out the included link and maybe hop around a bit and see what the GM people are doing to use Steam's community features.  I find it very intriguing stuff. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Second, to put a product up on steam AND have a discussion/workshop area there, imho it is mandatory to have someone official giving constant support there and we all know how good the official support was on this official board already. You won't believe the amount and types of questions are raised on such boards. And with Monkeys easy nature of getting it to set up and run, I say good luck. It will give the product a bad reputation. Another development tool which I use is imho suffering from a split community and lack of support.

As I said, I'm pretty sure someone has to approve of these apps manually, since the last time I submitted one (albeit quite a while ago), it took some time to appear.  That is, however, a bit off-topic.<br><br>I'd like to direct the attention towards Steam's ability to provide a community portal as a turnkey solution.  The underlying support can be provided by the community <i>provided one which can sustain itself exists</i>.  Honestly I believe that this solution is actually better than the one built here, but it has one glaring problem -- this site's community already exists, and the one on Steam does not.  So the argument for keeping the status quo is basically self-endorsing.  The obvious counter-argument to me would be that improvements cannot be made without a change to the status quo.<br><br>So, in light of your reasoning that "splitting" the community could fire back: for the sake of argument, why not consider retiring the forums and app section here and transferring it to the Steam community, which has the more robustly-built and expandable back-end?  The main website then could focus on the following two things:  1.  A better sell page / front page, and 2.  Better documentation with "community features" that the Steam portal wouldn't be able to reliably provide.<br><br>That being said, GM:S seems to have multiple portals available to its developers, and doesn't appear to be suffering from it.  I believe that may be because they've managed to expand their userbase beyond their own forums.  It's not a death knell to have more than one community portal, if either the community is large enough to handle it, or one is clearly superior for certain uses over the other.  Both can even co-exist despite superiority in certain functionality, if both portals have functionality which compliment the other. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I don't care about seeing all that stuff going on at all times, I just want to see topics and the related messages. Maybe we can find a less noisy place? I have nothing in mind at the moment though.<br><br>As for the splitting communities, it's something you simply cannot avoid once the product gets famous enough. It's simply natural to see communities arouse in every corner, like Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, unofficial forums, etc... but of course we should focus our efforts in one place. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That particular topic has been discussed to death already.  MX2 may very well be a great general-purpose language but this is not what I'm talking about either.  I'm talking about Monkey, its use as a game development toolchain, and the (barely existing) community which surrounds it.  Practically no one outside of here or the Blitz forums (particularly in amateur game development, Monkey's <i>original target demographic</i>) has even heard of Monkey, and that's a bad thing.  I am not in favor of remaining insular, either, although the consequence of that is that this forum will not likely be able to handle any real influx of new users if it were to ever get one.<br><br>Whenever I see a discussion of game development tools on other forums, Monkey is almost <i>never</i> mentioned unless one of the core users here happens to be there and brings it up.  I am pretty sure that a year ago, there were less than 1000 confirmed users of Monkey based on forum IDs.  It has practically no traction in the game development community outside of this small group of dedicated people.  Discounting the potential demographic of a place like Steam seems very short-sighted, if we're to assume that people here still want to eventually see Monkey as being considered one of the best toolchains to make games in.  <br><br>Provided that people actually <i>want</i> to expand Monkey's userbase with fresh blood, the way to sustain a healthy community without it "aging out" with the diehard BRL fans would be to have a place that better suits the expectations of that demographic.  People "like" social platforms like GitHub/Steam Workshop/whatever where they can share their creations with others and get some positive feedback from a large interconnected community.  It's hyper-networking beyond the small forums and mailing lists of yesteryear.  With that in consideration, please go and read my original post again if you want to understand the context in which I'm pitching this idea.. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

My sis and mom cannot even program, of course they don't need it either... We are talking about people who use Monkey, not people who don't use it.<br><br>Anyway, I think many people who have tried Monkey in the past, or try it now, are left disappointed because even though the language is good, the infrastructure is not. Meaning, you are not able to do great things with little hassle like you were able to do with other BRL products. Or to put it in another way, Mark may have spent too much effort into creating a great language, and too little into creating great libraries. Mojo 2 is a big improvement on the graphic department, but it took years. Meanwhile people have looked elsewhere.<br><br>So, whatever the place we will end up choosing to focus our community efforts, I think we should focus on making real-world examples to show people how quickly you can achieve great results with Monkey. Bananas inside the downloaded Monkey package are not enough. We need online examples. And since we can compile for HTML5, there's not excuse in not having them working and playable in a browser.<br><br>That said, I strongly believe we should make noise on Twitter. All the gamedevs are basically there. Using tags like #gamedev we can be seen by all of them. So people who #gamedev in general will hear about Monkey, and see it working by themselves. There's a lot of movement regarding game development there. And it solves the problem of the splitting communities. Anyone can have its own blog or whatever, and thanks to the hashtags everything will come together anyway. That's a great thing about Twitter, and other places where hashtags are used (but not when they are broken, like on Facebook). So my advice right now would be, everyone starts writing about what he's doing with Monkey (current project's development diary, or simply Monkey examples) somewhere (can be a personal web page, or a topic on these forums, or on gamedev.net, or whatever) and starts posting on Twitter with #gamedev and maybe #monkey-x hashtags at every new entry. This way we can start immediately and the whole game devs on Twitter will hear about Monkey.<br><br>Anything else will be harder to realize, because people don't want to leave these forums for a new place (laziness and change), and there would still be the discoverability problem. With Twitter + hashtags, we are automatically discoverable by anyone, and all of us can continue to write in their favorite places. A global hashtag like #gamedev (or #indiedev if you're an indie), plus an hashtag only for monkey, like #monkey-x or whatever we choose. So our new community will form and start to merge with the global gamedev one.<br><br>Thoughts? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
