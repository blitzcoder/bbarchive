This doesn't compile three-party modules like  Diddy.<br>I think that it should be stated clearly that Updates (currently MonkeyPro43) are available and how to get them.<br><br>- at firt run I was given choice to compile to HTML5, GLFW and XNA. Had to read the docs to find out why Flash and Android were not in the menu... <br>After all, that is why I bought the program. <br>How about giving a choice for every plattform supported and displaying a warning, e.g. : "Flash compiler not detected - see docs for help" instead ?<br><br>- GLFW reported a compile error at first attempts. This is probably due to the fact that a had .NET extensions alread installed, but not Microsoft C++ Express..<br><br>-After FLEX was installed, it was not automatically recognized because of new version 4.5.1 (last listed 4.5 in update43)<br>I finally managed to add : FLEX_PATH="${SYSTEMDRIVE}\flex_sdk_4.5.1" in config.winnt.txt.<br>Took a long time to fix because it was unclear if I had to manually add a quote to comment  every wrong FLEX_PATH  or if  I had to resolve ${SYSTEMDRIVE} manually and replace it with c:\<br>I think it would be interesting to have a warning (flex path not detected) or perhaps a config.winnt.txt path manager.<br>And how about automatic path detection ? Preferably with an external setup program.  After all, while intalling Android sdk, java sdk path was automatically detected...<br><br>-After installing C++ compiler (huge download, how about official MINGW support ?), I had the impression that MonkeyPro43 couldn't compile anymore.<br>Testing "Program Build" resulted in nothing showing up... But this was due to the fact that no program file was loaded... How about disabling unavailable items in the menu (gray text) ?<br><br>- First attempt to compile to GLFW resulted in an OpenAL32.dll missing. I managed to resolve this from Monkey Forum by download oalinst.zip. <br><br>- After installing Android SDK, I faced two problems :<br>(1) BUILD FAILED<br>C:\android-sdk\tools\ant\main_rules.xml:486: The following error occurred while executing this line:<br>C:\android-sdk\tools\ant\main_rules.xml:203: apply returned: 255<br><br>This seems due to the fact that source file was in my user folder and that building is not working with " " spaced-named subfolders (such as "Documents_ _and_ _setings").<br>Fixed by putting monkey source files at root of system drive for compiling.<br><br>Likewise, I had to re-install Android SDK on root of system drive instead of "Program Files/Android" as suggested by SDK installer.<br><br>(2) BUILD FAILED<br>C:\android-sdk\tools\ant\main_rules.xml:653: The following error occurred while executing this line:<br>C:\android-sdk\tools\ant\main_rules.xml:271: exec returned: 1<br><br>This was due to the fact that I didn't know that I had to start Adroid emulator before building...<br>BTW it took very long time to show up emulator at the first time...<br><br>That's all for the moment, folks...  Hope this will help others.<br><br>Paul <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
