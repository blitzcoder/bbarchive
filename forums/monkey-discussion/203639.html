Obviously all the graphics part will have to be modified to new drivers designed for the Java VM, etc. If we were a bigger community, it would be an interesting community project, and work could be done in a "by module" basis so it would be very unit-testing prone. That said, I don't think it is viable unless a big team works lots of hours a day. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The syntax is also very similar to Java.<br><br>Yeah, I think a good communication would be way better to attract new users than all this hard work.<br>I choose Monkey because I though it would be the next BlitzMax but in fact this is not its purpose. Everything will stay lightweight in order to <b>write the same code and output to multiple target easily</b>.<br><br>BlitzMax is still very good, fast and complete! So why not continue to improve it and keep monkey for small mobile devices? I would not say that BlitzMax is over but many left because they wanted a bit more or was only interested by the programming language in itself (and so, certainly switch to Monkey because of the nice new features and they don't mind if something is missing because they can write it again and again). Is it hard to believe that in 2012 people are still interested to develop for Windows/Linux/Mac only? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
