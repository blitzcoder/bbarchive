I have your tax id, tax forms, SSN, DOB, Name, Address, Credit card details and more sensitive data. Now, I can go ahead and leak your details online which would damage your credit score like hell and would create a lot of problems for you.<br><br>If you would like to prevent me from doing this then you need to send 1 bitcoin to the following BTC address.<br><br>Bitcoin Address:<br>1QAQTyhCzAfvp8uLpneBNamWTNRR1hx9Cp<br><br>You can buy bitcoins using online exchanges easily. The bitcoin address is unique to you. Sending bitcoin takes take, so you better get started right now, you have 48 hours in total. <br> <br></div><br><br>Has anyone received this kind of email?<br><br>I'm not too concerned, however I am extremely pissed off about this as I don't have time for this shit. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

They likely only have your e-mail. Ignore it. Don't reply. If your info really is out there they would not be the only one with access to it. Unfortunately most likely many people will fall for it and give them money which will only encourage them more. Also, they are liars - they sent the same wallet id to everyone. I got multiple e-mails all went into spam folder. At least so far no one has sent them money. Hopefully none do, and the scammer attempting this gets caught.<br><br><a href="https://blockchain.info/address/1QAQTyhCzAfvp8uLpneBNamWTNRR1hx9Cp" target="_blank">https://blockchain.info/address/1QAQTyhCzAfvp8uLpneBNamWTNRR1hx9Cp</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
