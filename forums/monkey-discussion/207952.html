Your suggested mechanism seems a bit obscure.<br><br>I'd suggest tying it to a score. Add a combo mechanism for multiple hexes hit between bat contacts and the score will generally reflect your idea while being clear to the user (as long as you bust out some "Combo 7x!" style notifiers, which are nice to have anyway). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
