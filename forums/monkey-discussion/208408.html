A few changes to the way it is presented to new users will be able to yield new users and bring some lifeblood back in it for Mark:<br><br>1) Move the 'Apps' page to the community submenu and rename it WIP. Then replace it with a new page called 'Made with Monkey' and build a static page that shows off the games (that are in the app stores) that show Monkey off to be impressive. Such as this; <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tiny-flippers/id626059327?l=ru&amp;ls=1&amp;mt=8." target="_blank">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tiny-flippers/id626059327?l=ru&amp;ls=1&amp;mt=8.</a> New users want to see what the language can do, not WIP of other new users. If i didn't trawl through the forums then I wouldn't know how great Monkey is.<br><br>2) Bundle the free version of Jungle as the official IDE. I am sure the creator of Jungle will be OK with this as it will increase people having it and he can easily include an 'upgrade Jungle' link.<br><br>3) Create an installer package rather than downloading zip files, new users want to be stepped through this process, not have to drag out or extract zip files.<br><br>4) Charge for updates. You are worth it Mark. This doesn't have to be a lot, and I am sure we will all be happy to pay for additional features for $30 a year if it means updates and that you are happy and focused on Monkey as a product without having to worry about extra jobs and dividing your time. This will also reward you for your additional handwork. Monkey is too cheap for what it does and the amount of work you have put into it.<br><br><br>Everyone here, please feel free to add to this discussion or give some feedback on my suggestions. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Thus, I suggest Monkey X to have Mollusk integration.<br><br>However, I do not think Monkey X will be able to beat competitors in the market that it wants to be in. Professional game programming works now with GUI authoring tools not great libraries. these game tools producers create tools for cheap, quick, junk games for mobile devices. <br><br>I suggest minib3d project to be encouraged, helped and brought into Monkey X and Monkey must become a product for hobby programers. I know all of my colleagues (programmers) love to have something like modern Blitz3D, so you just open an editor and create a 3D scene in few lines of code. Some of my friend are Java programmers, but they learned C# just for XNA. They do not use C# in their professional work. Besides, many millions of young kids like to program games, they do not have time to OOP hocus pocus setup. My point, my point is that there is good market for hobby game programming. To be in a right market is important. <br><br>Summary:<br>I agree with boomboom  + <br>Great Monkey X (beautiful OOP) +<br>Mollusk - it seem very lean to me and I have no license headache with it +<br>minib3D (shadow, rigid bodies physics, decent 3D model) +<br>Hobby programming market with good advertisement for it +<br>Annual membership for some amount, OK. <br><br>However, we do not know about Mark, may be he does not care about money from game industry, may be Monkey X is just his hobby, which I do not at all blame him because I would do the same thing and I indeed look at game programing from hobby point of view. <br><br>By the way, I promoted Monkey X among some of my friends and computer science students, I think they did not like it because it do not have: "... ... installer package ..."  indeed boomboom wants Monkey X to be like B3D product, which I agree. <br><br>Also, how about future of HTML 5, may be Mark knows something we don't.  May be HTML 5 will be enough one day. Some of my web programmers friends tell me that future of everything is HTML 5. I don't know, I am getting too old!<br><br>B3D beat the hell of all competitors in hobby game programing. I think Entity engine was the reason. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Although I've now written (currently) 47 games with Monkey, and have about 6 of them on the iOS AppStore at 69p, I'm getting what can only be described as pitiful sales figures.  If I relied on my app sales to pay for a subscription, I'd be pretty much penniless by now!!<br>Having said that, you never can tell how the world of Mobile Sales can go, and sometimes an absolute fluke of good luck will result in a fairly substantial amount of actually usable funds in my bank account!!  A rarity, but .. you never know what might happen.<br>In times like that, it'd be nice to be able to give a little back to Mark, and as such, having the ability to Donate direct to him/BRL, as I have the ability to do so, would be a MUCH better option, than having any sort of pre-enforced cost attached to my continued use of the language, especially when 95% of my output is going out as Freeware!! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Blitzmax has paid my rent for 10 years and the community that's grown around Blitz3d/BMax is the best of anything out there.

They care more when there is bug or lack of feature. They have better understanding of the areas that need to be improved because their income depends on using Monkey. Since they contribute more, they do not pay or maybe pay less.
