I think you might be misunderstanding how branches work.  Your local changes aren't "lost", they're simply a different changeset.  If you look in the workbench for repository 2, you should see something like this (ignore my keyboard spam commit messages):<br><br><img src="http://puu.sh/LcYe"><br>Where revision 2 is from the first repository, and revision 1 is the local change that has yet to be pushed.  Nothing is lost, it's just not the current changeset.  No merge should happen unless you explicitly tell it to.  Your head is still in CVCS-land in that case.<br><br>Edit: In this example, you would update to revision 2, then right click revision 1 and choose Merge with Local.  Resolve any conflicts, then commit.  It should now look like this:<br><br><img src="http://puu.sh/Ld9m"><br><br>2nd Edit: If you push from repo 2, then pull to repo 1, you should get this:<br><br><img src="http://puu.sh/Lde4"><br>Then update to revision 3, and it should look pretty much identical to repo 2.<br><br>3rd Edit: An automatic merge will only happen if you have new/deleted/modified files in your working directory when you update to another changeset.<br><br>4th Edit: Note that revision "numbers" are generated locally for the sake of display.  The same changeset may have a different revision number in another clone, but internally it has the same ID and the graph should look identical per-branch.  Notice here that the changesets with revisions 1 and 2 are in a different order in each repository.  This doesn't matter because the changesets aren't related until the merge. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You should probably think of "modified" as meaning "uncommitted".  If you have a clean working directory when you update (ie. no added/removed/modified files since the last commit), all your code is still there, just not the current changeset.
