That, unfortunately, means I feel like a complete newcomer when it comes to games programming :).<br><br>Now, I've been playing around with the demo version of monkey along with some of the tutorials until yesterday when I decided to purchase the monkey-package and I'm very excited to get started with an idea I have for a game.<br><br>Now, I will be taking small steps, and my "grand" ideas won't be my first projects, but I would like to build up towards being able to create a more strategy-like game, and my "niche" of games would be what you might find in the lower price ranges in the various appstores, smaller strategy and time management games.. some with RTS like functionality.<br><br>However, as a complete newcomer to games programming, I'm at a bit of a loss as to where to start. Most of the tutorials around here are for shooters and platform games, but as you understand I've got something else in mind.<br><br>Where should I start? Are there any frameworks that would be suitable for my type of needs? Much of my gameplay will be point and click with some spritemovements around background image (i.e. not necessarily scrolling backgrounds).. <br><br>Any pointers towards tutorials and frameworks for these types of games would be much appreciated!<br><br>Thanks <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The most basic tutorials feel a bit too basic because of my programming background, so it's difficult to know where to "jump in".. right now I'm doing the stuff in the book I mentioned, but it's mostly shooters which I'm not that interested in doing, but I feel I'm getting an idea of how things work in a game-development situation.<br><br>I was planning on breaking down my ideas into smaller project just like you suggested. For example, I have an idea for a minigame between levels in my strategy game, and I figured it would be a nice place to start, but things such as pathfinding etc will be essential later on, so I will probably add your suggestion to my list of things to do :). <br><br>Thanks again!<br><br>/Daniel <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Your game is the model and what the player sees is the view.  He can click to tell the game to give a unit orders, or to change the view.  When in-game time passes, the game is informed and updates itself, with all units moving or acting appropriately. In the most simplistic case, the view will always show the current state of the game. In this case writing an RTS won't be so different from writing a boardgame like Chess.<br><br>Complications can arise when you want to get a bit fancy with graphics.  For example say the game atomically processes a shell hit and several troops die, but you want to show that graphically over a period of time.  You can get away with a certain amount of letting the view look after this kind of thing, but that gets messy as it gets more complex.  But modelling this extraneous stuff in your game is also messy.  In short, game programs always get messy, especially as game design is usually done simultaneously with development!  It's very important not to overcomplicate things or try to find the perfect, ever-expansible design. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Thank you everyone for chipping in. <br><br>As part of the book I mentioned above, I'm about to dive into writing the game in chapter 7, "At the docks", which is a small Sokoban clone. From reading through the chapter first, I know that it will introduce me to level handling, sprite maps and collision handling.<br><br>Now, throughout this book, I've been using a framework created by the author called the fantomEngine. It has given me a free ride regarding some core stuff and I'm wondering if it's a mistake to use a framework this early - I might miss out on "understanding" some of the basics, and I might also make me a bit dependent on it for future development as it might be "the only thing I'm used to".<br><br>Any thoughts on the fantomEngine?
