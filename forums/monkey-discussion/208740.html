This is very hard to live.<br>Do you ever write any software for only USD 100 and then no extra fee for maintenance? NO ONE!!!<br><u>It does not show any respect to Mark at all.</u><br>Each major updates should be charged, especially for 1 developer.(Unity has 1.x,2.x..,4.x and platform module, and GameMaker has 8.x and studio)<br>Unity or Unreal has over 200 employers. GameMaker is going to have 50.<br>Monkey has 1 only to maintain different platforms.<br>No respect for 1 person fighting with large companies with many employees??? Why?<br>With more budget, Mark don't need to care about other things and concentrate on future development.<br><br>Why not consider KickStarter to raise funding?<br>I saw some guys just propose their visions. They don't have the physical products at all and still get good funding. Just show what you have done to the world. Monkey is already a practical product and run daily. Many games are created with it. Why not draft a proposal for Monkey 2 features? Some supporters are quite rich and are willing to support good projects.<br>How about greenlight on steam? Even very bad games or softwares can be put to sell on Steam, why not Monkey?<br><br>Besides, why Monkey users are shy to mention that the games are "powered by Monkey-X", so that many people know this name on internet?<br><br>If budget is allowed, why there is no monkey-x asset store to sell monkey stuffs, like Unity asset store? Why there is no Monkey-X T-shirt, hat or cup, etc.?<br><br>Although one vs. many, Monkey (USD 100) run faster than Unity (USD 1500+1500 = 3000 for android platform).<br>Pay more, Get less.???<br><br>Quote from unity user "Xaron":<br><div class="quote"> I've used 2000 sprites which move randomly over the screen. Results are:<br><br>Unity 4.5<br>APK size: 8,404,358 bytes<br>FPS: ~20<br><br>Monkey v79c<br>APK size: 67,331 bytes<br>FPS: ~33 <br> <br></div><br><br><a href="http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/speed-comparison-2d-unity-vs-monkey.248926/" target="_blank">See here!</a><br><br>Besides, with Mark's long-term software experience (&gt; 30 years), he could make some live workshops (with fee) or live discussion (may be youtube live) to teach people how to program, compiler design and optimization techniques. "mark sibly" is a brand name. Others can benefit from the workshops and Mark gets funding. Win-Win situation. <br>example: subscription of "cgcookie" to provide tutorials for blender and special fee for blender workshops..<br>How about Monkey-X workshop???<br><br>Open-source cannot save Monkey.It would only leave it to the current state.<br>No one know all key elements of Monkey design, except Mark. (Mark may train some guys to continue Monkey) <br><br>Why not there is a "Donate" button here or in Monkey-X forum, <br>if someone want to support Monkey-X future development? <br>How about listing the donor name too?<br><br>Just my 2 cents.<br><br>Please comment. <br>Thank you for your attention. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Perhaps it can be circumvented with fame rising.<br><br><br>--------- Segmentation: higher aims with higher fees <br>To recruit new Monkey coders, the freely available option for some limited platforms/features  should remain. For a broader target audience, more detailed segmentation should apply.<br>e.g.<br>- PC platforms: free (or rather some extra/more professional features / latest updates cost some USDs)<br> -mobiles kit: 30 usd a year or per update (don't know how frequent they are)<br> -console kit: the same<br> ..etc..<br><br> <br>------- only One version of Monkey yet<br> Remember Commodore's bankruptcy? <br> Suggest Rather be unrivalled and famous in one strict field, eg. König of 2d Game Creator softwares for the most platforms. Then will external modules be created and coming of masses.<br> It is not like the situation of Construct, made by apprentices, done with mistakes, thus forced to create Construct 2!<br><br><br>--------- Marketing<br>-Developed titles should have a non-distrurbin tag/info, what developing tool was used, eg. after program is closed appearing for 1 second.<br>-Active Monkey Coders or helpful community members should upload finished titles to video sharing portals, write/or have a signature about Monkey-X at Gamedev like sites.<br>- Steam: possibly good idea - i dont know much about it.<br><br><br><br>----------- Volunteer/ community  work <br>in all kinds of tasks would be favorable.<br>We cannot talk about PR when 1 person has been doing everything. Make a team.<br>All seeing eyes must we be with, with other tasks like SWOT analysis and all the non-code works, or can it be shared, too?<br><br><br>--------<br>Mark, hopefully you read us, and will share thy thougts on our comments, or what help you need.<br>Anyway thanks for everything, and all the best.<br>--------<br><br><br>OFF / intro on me:<br>Presented my 1st (and perhaps last post here - not being a net society member) as heard much appreciation about BlitzBasic in Amiga times, happy to find its latest materialization to try.

The first is the name, the second is the amount of faff required.<br><br>I've always thought that Monkey was a silly name, and to this day I cannot understand how it ever got called that.  The Blitz name has been synonymous with game development for the best part of 20 years (if not more?), so it boggles the mind why BRL would abandon it just like that, especially in favour of such an apparently random word which means nothing to anybody - you can't even google it without getting thousands of sites about actual monkeys.<br><br>The other problem - the faff.  Speaking as someone who hasn't really used Monkey a lot in the last couple of years - there wasn't even a debugger of any kind at the time which made the whole development process a living hell.  But that aside, you've got all the manual configuration stuff to attend to.  Download this, install that, find and edit config files so Monkey knows where it is, oh but wait that's the wrong version and Monkey doesn't like it, repeat ad nauseam.  Then the small matter of publishing anything on iOS (haven't done Android so can't comment) - it spits out an XCode project, and that should be the end of it, but it isn't - far from it.  I now need a crash course in ruddy XCode to finish off my game and put right all the stuff Monkey *doesn't* do for me.  And the best part is, if for any reason I need to delete the build folder as is oft-recommended, I have to do it ALL AGAIN.  Why the hell is it like that?  It doesn't make sense.<br><br>A lot of things about Monkey are great, but there's a hell of a lot that wrecks the whole experience and takes away a lot of the pleasure that can be had from game development.  Even the IDE is so basic it's next to useless - doesn't even have intellisense.  A case-sensitive OO language, with no intellisense.  Really?!  If not for Jungle then I'd suggest that the Monkey user-base would be a fraction of it's size because its own IDE just isn't up to the job for serious development work.<br><br>Even with all that in mind I'm considering moving TO Monkey from Blitzmax so I can target other platforms.  It's quirks aren't insurmountable - it's just that there's so damn many of them.  You can say the same about Blitzmax I guess, to a point, and that was worth getting to grips with - mine's paid for itself many times over.  I guess Monkey will/would too.  But I fear that anybody from outside of the Blitz camp, wouldn't quite see it that way.<br><br>Oh and just to add, as this does sound like a right old battering now I've re-read it - I have massive respect and gratitude for BRL.  If it wasn't for them doing what they do, I'd be stuck in some shitty dead-end 9-5 with no hope of doing something amazing, and no future. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

As for the topic, I really love BRL products, but truth is proprietary languages are not what they used to be nowadays... And this is not mark's fault. Sure, there are a lot of things that can be addressed, but the thing is... right now the huge amount of already-done things in mainstream languages make up for their complexity. Codebases for things like Javascript, C#, C++ are HUGE and there are a lot of things that are free and have good quality. Unity is not forcing developers to learn/write code in a new language and they can also benefit from those huge code bases. You want to do some out of the box thing in monkey? Chances are you will have to write it yourself. You're doing the same in Javascript, or C++? It's almost granted that someone already did that. Landscape is not what it was 10 years ago. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
