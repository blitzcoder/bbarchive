OpenCart modules are cheap (most &lt; $10 each).  50-50 split with BRL would be cool, and that way Monkey could be free or even cheaper.  Don't get me wrong, I think Monkey is too cheap at the moment, but lots of people will just go the free route instead of paying $99 or whatever it currently is.

You pay once and use the product or subscribe to get all updates OR subscribe/unsubscribe as many times as you want to get updates. This is a great model and it works, developers accept it.

I prefer real coding by far, but you can still make complete games with the drag and drop solutions as long as they have enough tot hem. Tons of top selling games were made with these solutions. I know, I worked on projects where they were used. Unreal and Unity both have drag and drop solutions. PlayMaker and Blueprints - both of which do make prototyping faster, and enable artist types to make things without relying on the team coders. A drag and drop solution for Monkey would totally be possible to make, and it would bring in a certain market who wants that, but it may not be worth making just because of tool saturation in the market. Monkey's strengths are important to me, but with people only focused on releasing on just mobile other tools have more appeal. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I have nothing against it as long as I know what it is doing. Besides, we are adding some editor tools to our frameworks that work with drag and drop but you will still have to do some 'real' coding. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
