<table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr ><td class="posthead"><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr ><td >Nobuyuki</td><td align="right"><font class=tiny>(Posted 2013)</font>&nbsp;<a href="#1">[#1]</a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr ><td class="posttext"> Hello hello, I didn't want to messy up Shinkiro's thread on Monkey productivity increasers with my language feature requests, since he specifically requested that this not happen, but as it would happen I ended up writing a bunch of these out anyway and thought "why let all that text go to waste"?  Anyway, so, here's another thread where we can talk about our pet language features we wanna see in Monkey, and perhaps how we would use them if they were available.<br><br>I will try to stick to core additions to the language, and avoid feature requests on mojo.  It would be nice to see a thread just about core monkey/brl stuff, but we'll see how it goes!  And now, without further ado:<br><br><br>* <b>Generic Interfaces</b>.  This one's probably big.  Once this is in, we can probably do a lot of things.  Like improving the standard libraries and container classes, introducing a more thorough and extendable hierarchy.  I hear Mark's working on this one right now.<br><br>* <b>TypeOf</b>/typeid/<b>Is</b> operator.  Using TypeOf would be nice for a lot of things;  assigning a type, comparing types, etc.  Basically, reflection lite.  Having type introspection without having to import reflection allows trans to still optimize-out unreachable code while giving us one of the nicer things reflection also gives us.  Some examples:<br><br><textarea class=codebox name="code" wrap=OFF readonly="true" rows="15" cols="80">
  'Use case scenario 1.  Determine what type is being used in the generic class.
  
  'The VB-like syntax here is the most verbose of various languages' implementations, but
  'it allows for the widest number of use case scenarios, as you'll see below.
  'Other syntaxes, like "TypeOf(var)=type" or simply "var Is type" can't be applied universally.
  'Depending on lang features wanted though, one or the other may be more succinct/consistent.


Class TwoThings&lt;T&gt;
  Method DoSomething(arg:T)
    If TypeOf arg Is Int
      arg += 1
    ElseIf TypeOf arg Is String
      arg += " and so on"
    End If
  End Method
End Class


'Use case scenario 2.  Determine what class type is using that interface.
Interface iDidIt
  Method DoIt()
End Interface

Class DoesAThing implements iDidIt
  Method DoIt()
  End Method

  Method DoMore()
  End Method
End Class

Class DoesSomethingDifferent Implements iDidIt
  Method DoIt()
  End Method

  Method DoSomethingElse()
  End Method	
End Class

Global Something:iDidIt
Global Things:= New List&lt;iDidIt&gt;

Function Main()
  Local MyThing:=New DoesAThing()
  Something = MyThing

  'If TypeOf is the static type, this is a DoesAThing, otherwise it's an iDidIt.
  'In VB it would be an iDidIt, in C# it's a DoesAThing, and typeid() returns iDidIt instead.
  Local MyOtherThing:TypeOf(Something)  
  
  If TypeOf MyOtherThing Is iDidIt Then
  	MyOtherThing.DoIt()
  ElseIf TypeOf MyOtherThing Is DoesAThing Then
    MyOtherThing.DoMore()
  End If

'Use case scenario 3.  Determining type with Select statements.
'The Is keyword is the nicest syntax here, since it's syntactically consistent with
'expression evaluation, another feature which I wrote more about below...

'Again, mentioning TypeOf isn't necessary if Is returns the type instead of compares it.
  For Local o:= EachIn Things
    Select TypeOf o
    Case Is DoesAThing
	  o.DoMore()
    Case Is DoesSomethingDifferent
	  o.DoSomethingElse()  
    End Select
  Next
End Function
</textarea><br><br><br>* <b>Async</b> support as a first-class citizen of Monkey.  A way to define methods as asynchronous with a piece of complimentary syntax (Like VB.NET's new <b>Await</b> operator) which would let us assign values from asynchronous methods in an imperative manner, pending successful completion of the async method.  For example,<br><pre class=code>
Field MyImage:Image = Await LoadImageAsync("default.png")
</pre><br>MyImage returns NULL until LoadImageAsync() has done its job.  VB paired this with a function modifier called <i>Async</i> which, along with our friends <i>Property</i> and <i>Abstract</i>, would fit in just fine with Monkey syntax.<br><br>For how .NET does this, see here:  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/hh191443.aspx" target="_blank">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/hh191443.aspx</a>   <br>Very cool.<br><br><br>* More syntactic sugar with <b>Select</b> statements. Previously, Select broke when combined with Generics, so I'm a bit wary to use it in lieu of Elseif statements, as it provides little syntactic sugar as-is.  VB.NET extends Case syntax with the Is operator by allowing shorthanded expressions and comparing to those which evaluate to True, such as "Case Is &gt; 5".  However, lexically, this is not the same type of comparison Is makes in other situations, .  This can be resolved by changing the syntax to something like this:<br><br><pre class=code>
  Select something  'Evaluates until reaching the first True statement
    Case 1  'Equals is implied for backwards compatibility
    Case = 2
    Case &gt; 5 
    Case = -50 To -10
    Case &lt;&gt; 0 And Case &gt; -100  'Either 0 or less than -100
    Default  'Between 0 and -100, unless it's from -50 to -10
  End Select
</pre><br><br>Edit:  Regarding the syntax, the keyword Case would be substituted for the expression (in this case, <i>something</i>) at compile-time and evaluating for True.  VB.NET syntax might still make more intuitive sense here, if multiple evaluations are separated using commas instead of logical ops, but would still not be lexically equivalent to the aforementioned Is operator.  eg:  <br><pre class=code>Case 1 To 4, 7 To 9, 11, 13, Is &gt; maxNumber</pre> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I thought on some platforms, casting is implementation-specific and such behavior shouldn't be relied upon.  Casting objects is black magic as far as I'm concerned.<br><br>Task-based Async operates by having some sort of layer over a Task-based interface system in .NET.  <b>Await</b> combined with a call to a function with the <b>Async</b> modifier seems to hint to the compiler to unroll something behind the scenes which handles the actual asynchronous methods and sends the appropriate contents back to the variable being assigned the result of the task.  The link on Task return types below explains it more, it sounds like some sort of variation auto-unboxing, which Await invokes.  In Microsoft's terminology, "The task is a promise to produce an actual [returnType] object after the requested data has been downloaded and the task has run to completion.  To retrieve the [returnType] value from the Task, apply an Await operator to the call."<br><br>On my initial glance, it appears to be a very glossy layer of sugar over an extremely common scenario where async would be used.  However, I'm not familiar with typical asynchronous usage patterns.  Here is more info on this feature:<br><br><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh873175%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" target="_blank">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh873175%28v=vs.110%29.aspx</a>  about task-based asynchronous patterns<br><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/hh524395.aspx" target="_blank">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/hh524395.aspx</a>  about the Task&lt;T&gt; return type and how the Async keyword works magic on Return syntax<br><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/hh873191.aspx" target="_blank">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/hh873191.aspx</a>  how control flow occurs with this usage pattern<br><br>The implementation would most likely heavily lean on brl.thread.  And yes, you'd still have to check for Null, unless you adapt the control flow in such a way that your main execution block depends on the tasks' completion or timeout, or set it to something else first with a blocking call.  These are the typical cases in almost every scenario, either a loading bar where the main thread isn't blocked by heavy asset pulls, or a placeholder image being shown while the asset's being loaded.<br><br>For example:<br><pre class=code>
'In the init method....
placeholder = LoadImage("Default.png") 'Blocking call
img = placeholder

img = Await LoadImageAsync("BigFile.png")

'In the render method.....
DrawImage(img, 8,8)   'Will draw placeholder until LoadImageAsync() returns

But on the topic of the casting work around, this doesn't work with non-object types. If you attempt to cast your template/generic class's type as an 'Int', 'Float', 'Bool', or 'String', you will be given an error at compile-time, not runtime.

</textarea><br><br>The lazy way to make this work for trans without any major edits is to convert all template/generic-class related lines with the non-object types on them to their object-wrapper counterparts (List&lt;Int&gt; to List&lt;IntObject&gt; for example), but that sounds terrible (Not to mention a debugging nightmare). But the whole idea of "We should check on runtime what should be checked on compile-time" seems like it'd be horribly inefficient, not to mention bad practice for such a basic check.<br><br>In terms of main features I'd like to see, here's the main few that seem viable:<br><br>* Protected: The fact that this isn't already a part of Monkey is sad, <a href="http://monkeycoder.co.nz/Community/posts.php?topic=5548&amp;post=70971" target="_blank">here's my thoughts on it</a>.<br><br>* A preprocessor for templates/generic classes (As stated above):<br>Perhaps with a '$' prefix, instead of '#'?<br><br>* Optional stack allocation of classes, or at the very least structs:<br>This would be very nice to have, and it's not like you can't make things heap-allocated on targets which hate the stack. Everything is garbage collected in Monkey anyway, it's not like there's a real difference to the user. Plus, this would make threads a bit more friendly on some targets.<br><br>* Some form of template/generic-class support for reflection. (This drove me crazy at one point)<br>* Template/generic functions, so I don't have to make a new class for every function (Or group of functions). (Even C# has that)<br><br>By the way, am I the only one who misses 'Preview' when making a forum post? And on the topic of the forum, why can't I search through people's posts like I used to? (Or at the very least my own) At least make it so I can search the forum without an input if I have a username. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
