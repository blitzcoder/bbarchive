While this dated design could attract some indies, it puts Monkey in a very bad competing situation on the first impression land and, in this kind of development tools, first impression is everything. Newcomers won't bother reading why Monkey is su much better than any of the other multi-device 2d game development tools, if they don't get the best first impression possible.

I've found more than a handful in the past, just looking through the validation code of these forum systems. As well as having had a kiddie scripter use a ready-made SQL injection to steal account information from a live forum using one of these. I cannot recommended enough against using them; cause if a nasty security bug is found and some kiddie scripter gets their hands on it, they can do some serious damage to the forums. As long as you avoid those systems, though, only someone who really knows what they're doing can find their way in. And people like that, typically aren't there to steal information, they're there for the thrill.<br><br>On another similar note, I've programmed around 5 different forums (...cause I'm never satisfied...) in php/AJAX/SQL(MySQL). If any help with SQL or php is needed, I've been doing it for ages and am open to doing it any time.

This however, was not what made my decision final. I ran a vBulletin on my site that was updated frequently and it was hit 2 years ago by a script kiddie. After that I've just had it with the crappy security programming going into these.

What it came down to for me was the style and how comfortable I was with it. When I used Unity, there were parts that were fine and other parts that felt very uncomfortable which made me drop it as a plausible choice for developing with.

Now it has a nice site, but that definitely is not what made me want to consider buying it.<br><br>What I mean by all of this is, yes the site is important, but it's not everything. The product itself needs to be presentable as well. Sadly, Ted falls short as an IDE and thus makes Monkey look bad.

Give it another chance! Erlang and Elixer work well with it. They all three complement each other very well for server applications because they have have extremely awesome strengths.<br><br>&gt;What I mean by all of this is, yes the site is important, but it's not everything. <br><br>It's the marketing which matters. It's why every other game dev tool has a much larger audience while rationally Monkey is superior for a lot of needs. To sell the best thing you can do is show opportunity. Other tools have better marketing which does this very well. Pretty pictures of games works really well because everyone is shallow. Other things such as social proof really work well - talking about the success is NSS is good, but it needs to be far more prominent. The front page has a ton of links and no clear call to action which stands out. It should be one link - buy - at the top. Mark needs a newsletter too. It is one of the most important marketing tools anyone can have. Understanding marketing requires understanding the real reason most people buy things. You don't have to guess, and you don't need any wizardly marketing insights (although they help to avoid mistakes) all you really need is the time and willingness to test to see what changes can be done to the sale page to increase conversion - there are lots of tools which can help make this easy so that more people buy. The more people who buy, the more who get invested in and can get into using it, which means more community activity and resources. The more people buy the more money Mark gets to support development.<br><br>&gt;there's not enough people to moderate them.<br><br>The only problem we have had with people here is talking in ways which encourages the community to remain insular. Look at the competition. They have open communities, and it works to their advantage. Keep the forum tidy and effortless or small, or allow the community to grow and use reporting features to keep trolls away. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The other day I had to buy some childrens shoes as we were looking after a friends daughter. I don't have any children, so it was totally new to me. It was an emergency situation at night so she arrived shoeless in her night time clothes. The next day I was able to walk into a shop, ask the lady at the counter what UK shoe size would equal 14cm feet. 5 mins later I left having made a purchase.<br><br>If she had made me signup to a loyalty/membership program before being allowed into the shop, I would have walked away.<br><br>It probably does not apply to all customers, but you will definitely have some that "walk away" because they can't inquire about the product first. When you add that to the website not having the right layout for selling the product, Id imagine you are going to lose a fair number of new customers.<br><br>The other thing that monkey needs to potential focus on if its wanting to attract a larger audience, is the feature set. I posted a while ago about some conversations I had with various indies in Cambridge meetups. A lot of people had heard about monkey but they had tried a very early version that didn't have many features. The lack of game orientated networking was a major turn off for some. It could potentially be good to also think of some target specific "plus pack" expansions?<br><br>It could be beneficial to start promoting some of the 3rd party features with monkey such as (if authors would permit):<br>- flixel/diddy/ignition<br>- jungle ide<br>- mini b3d<br>- spriter/spine<br><br>I could see a monkey + jungleide promotional package doing well!<br><br>Even if the 3rd party things are not core, it would definitely interest people to know that there are a ton of possibilities with monkey modules. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I have been in the Blitz community for a long time, having used BB back on the PC not long after it first came out.<br><br>I seriously understand Mark not being overly involved in the forums because it can be a huge time sink and sometimes you are damned if you do and damned if you don't.  But I positively hate almost no presence at all.  This thread is the perfect example.  You have people on here that are obviously passionate about Monkey and knowledgeable about selling but nary an official comment is ever made.<br><br>The demo seriously needs to be updated regularly and people need to be able to ask questions.  I would prefer better forums, but besides pagination and not being crazy about the search functionality, I can live with it.<br><br>If Monkey gets a wider user base, we all win.  Wider adoption means more people posting their excellent ideas and code.  More money for Mark to maybe hire someone to do better docs, or improve the IDE or do some marketing , which in turns brings in more users, etc :)<br><br>The Blitz community has always been one of it's best selling points.  I have been on many forums over the years and the quality of posts and coders that make contributions is one of the best selling points for a Blitz product.  The way Brucey did things for Max and the great stuff being given away like diddy, miniB3D, fantomEngine and all of the stuff SKN is doing just to name a few are amazing and give the language so much functionality.<br>People trying an outdated demo with no access to the forums are not going to even know about any of that.  It shouldn't be a surprise that when someone buys Monkey they got way more than they bargained for because they couldn't see all of that great stuff beforehand. <br><br>Sorry for the long rant.  I am very passionate about Blitz and it frustrates me that a company that made tools that helped me be able to really bring my game ideas to life for the first time doesn't want more people to be able to do the same!<br><br>Mark, please listen to your loyal fans! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

However, two largish problem areas that are worth adding:<br><br>* Tools - Anyone coming from more standard dev environments will be dismayed at the state of tooling for Monkey. Even if you take the high water mark of Jungle it falls well short of free tools for many other languages.<br><br>* Community - There are some really talented and helpful people here but many other dev communities offer more available help and higher levels of expertise. It's a chicken and egg problem but still a problem.<br><br><br>The thing is that much of this stuff has been gone over before. What tends to happen is that the BRL faithful miss the point about market opinion and start arguing the validity of the criticisms.<br><br>Taking the syntax issue as an example, it generally results in the technical argument ("It's not really a BASIC.") or the practical equivalence/dismissive argument you were tempted by ("End is no different to curly brackets"). Both positions dodge the issue that familiarity and stylistic preference matter even if they have no foundational language design argument to support them. <br><br>Monkey syntax contains many elements and constructs that are BASIC-like and that's what people will see. That choice is like deciding to make a car and only offer it in neon pink. Yes, some people like neon pink. Yes, neon pink is just another colour and doesn't fundamentally affect the utility of the car. Guess what though? Most people still don't want a neon pink car. <br><br>Anyway, on a positive note things are getting better. Mark finally stuck the code on a public repo, which will help with some market segments, although I think the free version needs expanding beyond just HTML5. SlopeOak's Necrodancer project has the possibility of being a success (I think it has a good shot at Steam) that will significantly raise Monkey's profile in the indie community. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

ReDesign Main Website<br>2. Launch a new feature rich forum with sections for lite users to post in.<br>3. Update and Rebrand the demo to Monkey, the Pro at the end is enough to seperate the paid version from the normal version, calling it free or demo can be off putting.<br>4. Start Advertising the Key Community Modules, on the front page show off Diddy, Flixel,Jungle, FontText and its TOOL, and BOX2D and others, with links out to their downloads and or info pages.<br>5. THINK!.. about rebranding EVERYTHING.. I recall one of my first posts about this here, and over on bb.com was "WTF is with the name".<br><br>As for the name, Monkey has grown on me, but I like many others talk about it to colleges and the first thing out their mouths tends to be about the name.<br><br>Even languages like Pearl, Ruby, Java sound mad but they still sound mature, picture java first thing that pops to mind is coffee , ruby ? something valuable, Pearl ?, again something of value, Monkey ? something cheeky, for kids.<br><br>Look at Game Maker, there is absolutely no question what that is all about, hell its in the name, look at unity, makes you think of lots of things coming together, neither of them scream cheeky monkey or for kids.<br><br>I can understand that Mark wanted to get away from Blitz as a name, I just think he jumped in the wrong direction.<br><br>Which all begs the question, if he was to rebrand, what name would be a good choice. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
