Then I started a game on the Amiga, but then the PC took over and I had to scrap all my code. Then when the PC came I really thought that I could program forever, then came mobile, html, then a better language like metal, swift, mantle or whatever. <br><br>What monkey brings us is another layer of indirection, so we are future proof. Especially because everything is opensource. The source code is also written in a very direct cowboy style that I like, no enterprise class hierarchies with thousands of classes here. Want to implement a new target, just read 2-3 files with a few hundred lines of code, it's very straight forward. I mean compare the compiler for monkey (\src\transcc\transcc.monkey) with something like <a href="https://roslyn.codeplex.com" target="_blank">https://roslyn.codeplex.com</a><br><br>I have released one mobile game ( <a href="http://www.ninjanewton.com" target="_blank">http://www.ninjanewton.com</a> ), written my own code editor, my own 2d engine and editor for that, and is now working on a 3d engine aimed at procedural worlds. (I think it's a mistake to try to copy unreal engine or unity, not only because it's a lot of code, but because you need an army of artists to do something with those kind of engines.)<br><br>So monkey is still the best choice for me, and I think I will continue using it for a long time, no matter what Mark does with it.<br><br>If I could wish for something it would be to drop the flash target, make a real DirectX target, perhaps based on sharpdx and C#, make GC optional with a .Free. But I can do these things myself if I really have a need for them. And you can always get around the GC problems by just using arrays or databuffers. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

"Mobile" HTML5 in the less but still significant past was more bare bones so that it ran well on the devices which didn't yet support HTML5 proper well. Monkey HTML5 games run pretty well on modern mobile operating systems now with for example iOS 8 (just tested a game and it runs pretty well but still no audio by default), but in the not so distant past they were more slow or did not (or may still not) support many features Monkey HTML5 games rely on, such as the notoriously bad support for audio on many devices and mobile operating systems. We will soon get into the land of "it doesn't really matter" with new devices supporting everything really well. There will always be room for optimization though which is important to pay attention to. CPU intensive operations can still cause slowdowns on mobile devices where on desktop they run fine. If you care about cross platform it is a really good idea to test things along the way on a recent generation mobile device with the latest system updates it supports. There were/are other game frameworks which focused purely on optimizing for older devices, but in time they will be less relevant, and of course they did not give all of the runtime targets Monkey does. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

At that time the standard HTML5 target was not good enough to efficiently run Mobile HTML5 games. So I modded the target to increase the performance, added WebAudio if the browser supports it and slightly had to adapt how I programmed the game (e.g. All text are Images instead of using a font). In the end, it passed Spil Games' QA. Here is the game on their A10 website:<br><br><a href="http://play.a10.com/g/go-fishing/" target="_blank">A10 - Go Fishing!</a><br><br><br>In my opinion, Monkey is incredibly powerful while staying simple. However, Monkey always feels pretty raw. You can compile to all platforms but it is not always 100% what you want (e.g. you have to account for different screen sizes yourself, manually change the app name in XCode etc.). I don't know if this is the same for GameMaker or Unity though.<br><br>For me, Monkey is great for my needs as I am not interested in 3d games. I just love it for the fact that it essentially translates your code to java, objective-c, flash etc.<br><br>I have been thinking about making tutorials on how to make a simple game in Monkey. Then have it published on iOS, Android, WP8, Flash, HTML5 all with advertisements and also making sure that it works correctly on all devices. I hope that will help people to choose Monkey as their game development platform. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

All the publishes (BFG, iWIN, WIld Tangent, Steam, etc.) gives you support for Unity to integrate their framework. <br></div><br><br>well if you're making casual games or anything that's not super hi-tech 3d stuff, your customer probably cares.  Who wants 50mb of their 8gb phone (possibly with 1gb of userland space for apps) to be taken up by something they'll only play a few times?  This is worse if the game isn't "freemium" or f2p.  Ignore that section of your userbase at your own discretion (but also at your own peril)...<br><br>Really it's a matter of whether the extra wrangling with Monkey is worth the customers you'd otherwise lose having a bloated game package to install.  Sure, a lot of users don't care, but a lot of users also have already maxed out the space on their phone for apps and the size will make them say "pass" to a lot of apps they might've installed just to sneak a peek at. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
