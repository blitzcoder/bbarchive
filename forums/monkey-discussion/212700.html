My current project is that 3d submarine game which is done in Unity (because it's 3d) but I already plan ahead and will create more <b>2d games</b>.<br><br>Now to my inconclusiveness... I'm still not sure if I should continue to use Monkey <b>for 2d</b>. I mean it's mature, it's ready, it's in a stable state. BUT... lately Marks does what he can do best which is creating another language and I have no doubts that he will continue that way. It's just fine, it is as it is.<br><br>Ok, with Blitz3d and BlitzMax this was definitely ok as PC platforms usually do not change that much in short time. To the opposite mobile platforms change quite frequently which makes it mandatory to adapt the cross compiling modules quite actively. I'm still not sure if it's a clever idea for me to continue with this one-man-show which I LOVE so much or just to move on to kind of the industry standard which includes better and better 2d support (Unity).<br><br>Could you give me some input? My biggest worries are the future compatibility of Monkey that it reaches a point where I MUST move to MX2 which is a no go for me because some of my modules only work with the Java Android SDK and NOT with the needed NDK Monkey 2 uses...<br><br>Thanks! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'm a pure coder, grew up with 6502 assembly language on my good old C64, later on 68000 assembler on my Amiga, then I switched to C, now I work all day with C++/C# and Python in my job.<br><br>I loved Monkey from the first hour I saw it, I'm customer #1 (no joke), bought it immediately minutes after it came out. I bought additional licenses even though I did not need them. I patreon Mark for MX2. I own virtually everything Mark ever released and used it quite well even though I started releasing things with Monkey.<br><br>Up to now I have about 7 games released, most of them are really tiny, my submarine game will be the first huge one and I want to start to make this business more seriously. It's not only a hobby anymore. That's why I need tools I can rely on. Monkey works great NOW, but I have some concerns what happens when there is kind of a new API level or new services or whatever in this fast evolving mobile market. Mark's focus is on MX2 now and will stay there as long as there's something new to do. It's just what he can do best, creating compilers. For me it would be more important to maintain existing ones. So yes, he's still doing that here and there but I simply cannot rely on that anymore.<br><br>I mean just look into the bug reports forum: <a href="http://www.monkey-x.com/Community/topics.php?forum=201" target="_blank">http://www.monkey-x.com/Community/topics.php?forum=201</a><br>Things just don't get fixed anymore, I even don't talk about new features! It's just bugs, who are there and probably will stay there forever. This will become worse over time when API changes are coming. This was not a big issue during the times of BlitzBasic3d but nowadays it's a game changer! I'm not even sure if Mark look into this forum anymore. :(<br><br>I never worked with Haxe, but looking at this Javascript like language I get eye cancer. :D No just kidding I just don't get warm with it. I LOVE C#, it's a clean great and modern language. I don't like the Unity editor that much but I do most of the stuff code wise anyway. I'm still not sure what to use.<br><br><u>The biggest cons for Monkey for me are:</u><br>- one single developer - let him get sick or worse - game over<br>- I have quite some modules which work with the SDK part (Java) for Android, so I cannot switch to Monkey 2 which uses the NDK (C++)<br>- As I have to use Monkey 1 it's more and more likely that it doesn't get any updates anymore<br>- Slow bug fixing, probably no new features<br><br><u>The biggest pros for Monkey for me are:</u><br>- I LOVE it, well not an objective reason but it's important<br>- It's totally light weight<br>- open source<br>- fast prototyping<br><br><u>The biggest cons for Unity for me are:</u><br>- 3d engine, 2d support is in but not that well<br>- huge package size - well at least compared to Monkey<br>- closed source (yes it HAS ugly bugs where you have to wait for them to fix them or work around them)<br><br><u>The biggest pros for Unity for me are:</u><br>- maintained by a well founded company<br>- THE industry standard at the moment<br>- tons of working assets, lot's of modules which I would have to integrate in Monkey by myself are already there<br><br>I just wanted to get more input here. I do NOT want to diss Monkey or Mark, he's doing an awesome job in a very difficult environment. I just have to be realistic. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Its even worse. I got a friend complaining to me about it, a project of his - on android is something around 10mb, on iOS it got wo 25Mb and he has no idea why.<br><br>One of my latest games - "Senhor Presidente" (Mister President) on Android is only 2.9Mb (using Mojo1) and the game have already over 140k installs on Google Play Brazil :)<br><br>That friend of mine was almost ready to jump from Unity into Monkey, but he took a look at this forum... and asked me if "monkey had a future", because what he saw was a dying community.. I had to tell him that Monkey was great, but indeed it doesn't have much "future", just updates to keep compatibility here and then.<br><br>And he wasn't the only one. With all those downloads from my game, I have other Brazilians asking about "what engine did I use" and so on. <br><br>Its a shame, Monkey is one of the best solutions to mobile development (or web for that matter) - and it seems to be going the same path as Blitz3D and BlitzMax... :( <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I did the same mistake in the past. You can wait and struggle and try to decide what to use. No bright future, well ya, might be. But it works NOW and it's still the best out there NOW so I'm gonna use it. I use Monkey since it was released and made some pocket money using it - well even a bit more. 8 games so far. :) My 9th one will be made with Unity because it's 3d but after that I think I'm going to use Monkey again till I see something better on the horizon.<br><br>Even Unity's future is not that bright as I've heard here and there. They burn money, they will get bought by someone at some point and maybe in 5 years... who knows! You could argue that Monkey might not work in 5 years anymore, who knows, but now it works, I'm more and more confident and sorry for that bad kind of move I brought in here! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
