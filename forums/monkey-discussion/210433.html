My thoughts currently run something like this.<br><br>You come back to a game because it gives you something. Some kind of "fun" that you want to have again. This "fun" can come in many forms, including:<br><br>- Roleplay/fantasy "Wooo! I'm a sneaky spy man fighting robots!"<br>- Exploration "I can't wait to find out what the next boss is like/what it'll be like to have my next skill/what the best sword is, etc"<br>- Challenge and competition "Dammit, I almost had it! I'll try one more time."<br>- Related: mental challenge: "Solving the puzzles in this game makes me feel smart. I like to feel smart. I like this game."<br>- Narrative/story "What will happen next?"<br>- Beauty "Wow, look at that!" (Visual, audio, and even gameplay can be beautiful. Journey has beautiful gameplay as well as visuals.)<br>- Collectors drive/completism "Gotta catch em all!"<br>- Humour "Look, my goat can fly!"<br>- Expression "I'm gonna build my house *this* way!"<br><br>There's an Extra Credits video that goes over an academic paper covering this very topic. Look for the video and/or read the paper, it really helped me think about this. For example, procedural generation can give a game more exploration fun, as even the levels you've cleared before will be slightly different this time. But exploration is only fun if it occasionally rewards you. So if your procedurally generated dungeon is just the same rooms arranged slightly differently, it won't actually add much. The differences need to actually make a difference, if you see what I mean.<br><br>When thinking about why a game is good, you can think of it in terms of what flavour of "fun" the game delivers on. Most games offer at least two of these, even ones that on the surface it look like a pointless Skinner boxes. A major console release will have some of all of them, but the emphasis can be very different. Some do games well with one, though. Flappy Bird is basically just challenge, with a bit of humour and retro appeal. <br><br>Are you making a game? If so, what "fun" is it going to deliver? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Immersion through theme or imagination<br>2. Discovery of something new<br>3. The feeling of accomplishment<br><br>If you can encapsulate all three elements, the game has a chance at being fun. You could also be very strong in just one aspect and still have a fun game.<br><br>To breakdown:<br>1. Immersion- good art, good storyline, a novel concept, lovable characters.<br>2. Discovery- game variation, new levels, new ideas, new challenges, expansions, hidden easter eggs.<br>3. Accomplishment- figuring out a puzzle, enhanced visual/visual feedback of completing a task, leveling up, organizing information, competing.<br><br>Examples to think about:<br>- What makes a text-only adventure game fun? (discovery, immersion)<br>- What makes playing Super Mario Bros. fun for the 50th time playing it? (accomplishment, level progression, competing against your own prior record, lovable characters)<br>- What makes tetris fun? (organizing, novel concept, level progression, competition)<br>- What makes hidden object games fun? (immersion, discovery, puzzles)<br><br>I've been playing a lot of "Euro" board games lately, and it has opened my eyes to gaming in general. I'm not talking Monopoly, but things like Stone Age or even One Night Ultimate Werewolf. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That's a really nice model to think about these things.<br><br>When it comes to addiction, I'd say that's just a type of fun, as "fun" is whatever makes you come back to a game. Also, addiction is no less personal than "fun". I've tried many games touted as "soooo addictive!" that I found just boring. Any game will have some kind of carrot-stick mechanic, otherwise... what's the game? <br><br>There's some research to suggest that the most addictive game would be one that gives you a carrot for doing the thing, but only <i>sometimes</i>. That is, usually the reward is a bit of a dud, but occasionally you hit the jackpot. <br><br>Make of that what you will. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
