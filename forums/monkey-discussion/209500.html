I know there is Unity as well which I know in and out but my heart and love is still at all BRL products (I own them all).

Already have thought about the jam and "what do I want to learn with Blender"  - so I will try to have something "sculpted" (never done yet), animate with drivers (never done too) and extending my basic knowledge of the Blender "texture paint" mode (only know it exists and did simple things with it). Think there are plenty of things left to learn but this will obviously be 3 days of that week for asset creation. Another day gets spend to improve skills in splash/title-screen creation. So some days are left to get warm with the diddy-framework (checked that out some months ago and had to extend certain parts to support things I am used from my blitzmax-framework).<br><br>So for me "rehashing" could mean to use a simple barrel (which I have created within some minutes) and modify that later on - instead of recreating a barrel again just because I need another one for the new "jam".<br>For me this is similar to use the provided assets (your space ships) and modifying them for another game. As long as specific efforts are done to achieve the result I would not really blame it. <br><br>But that is not my jam, not my rules, so I will have to live with whatever people will come up ... hope "theme" is something my imagination comes along with nicely.<br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
