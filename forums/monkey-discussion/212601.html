He is developing it while beeing sponsored. Also TED2 is not really usable if you are used to JUNGLE or more advanced IDE's but I do think given time writing the IDE in Monkey2 is a brilliant move. This allows 3rd parties to step in and take it to a new level and it will run on most targets that Monkey2 runs on. I am sure a pre-build version ( binary ) will be available at some point. iOS, Android and 3d will also make it in I am sure so just a matter of time before it matures. I do love the language and once you get comfortable with the quirks ( for now ) it really is fun to work with. I also intend to offer pre-build packages with Pyro pre-installed once I feel Monkey2 and Pyro are getting there. Maybe for people who are not convinced yet should 'wait' and she what happens. I am not really interested in 3d right now but I guess once 3d makes it in there it will attract a new crowd too.<br><br>@Paul, yeah I am on Skype and I am interested in what you think. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Mark is posting with regularity in the blog (in mx2 website) - after years of silence this is a BIG change :) !<br>2. MX2 has so many 'strange' (for me at least) features that can be considered a 'translated version of C++ without curly brackets &amp; strange symbols'.<br>This doesn't mean you need/must use all the feature (Lambda() - once you get it - it's very handy!)<br>3. He's doing something... he's not his point of strength - but the MX2 site (it's a wordpress site - future proof) allow to add/insert comments &amp; code to build an online base (for my personal use in the first - I've added something *basic* about the use of List etc).<br>Moreover he's still working on tools to create on-source documentation, even if WIP.<br>And often Mark is 'teaching' (with answers in the forum).<br>4. the MX2 design (just read Mark's blog) seems to allow an 'easy' DLL integration/conversion: the latest updates in the core-language (Class extension, Method To etc) seems to allow some sort 'of magic' when dealing with different library): so - a 3d engine could be a real possibility (the idea of a 3d engine written directly form Mark is unfounded).<br>5. I've used MX1 Ted: my 'love' for MX1 is gone after some tests with the 'debugged' infos. In TED2 (at least) we have a better highlight: sure is not the BEST solution (I don't think it exists) but it's a step ahead (in my opinion): at the moment I always found where my error was. In MX1 I had more difficulties.<br><br>MX2 is *still* (and sure it will be) something in progress: Android / iOS support are delayed just because (I think) Mark is still fixing/calibrating everything.<br><br>The question is: What miss to MX2 to take-off? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Add the ability for users of the site to comment on each Document page allowing them to add code examples, allowing the community to help fill in the example snippet side of the docs.<br><br>2. Pay some one to do a 100% revamp of the website, I am a massive WordPress Fan really it's a simply stunning bit of code, but only mark could take something with it's capabilities and strip it down and make it look like a website from 1990 lol. The Website needs a total redo from a professional web developer.<br><br>3. Not going to rant, but splitting the community 3 times has been in my view catastrophic I simply have no clue what Marks initial thought process was but it's clearly wrecked things, the EASY solution here is to take the professional developer from item 2. and give him the additional task of merging all three sites and communities into one mega(as it should have been from the start) community, a community where a B3D coder ( Yes they still exist ) can post something and where a Monkey coder could look at it and go, Know what that's cool I wonder if I can do that monkey!.<br><br>Step 3 might be easy but of course wont be pain free. but I think at this stage drastic measures are required or this tiny community and Marks love will dwindle away to end up being nothing but 5 guys and a language, no one wants to see that, at least I hope not. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

For now, I've moved most of my near future commercial 2d projects to Defold as it publishes to platforms that matter, and has some serious productivity and performance gains possible. Everything that Defold has could be built for Monkey / Monkey 2, but I've already rebuilt all of the things we made for Monkey to make it usable for commercial projects, and at this point I'd rather focus on making games, and not doing the extra work to build the tools needed to make games on top of other tools... For a serious commercial 3d project, we're using Lumberyard (a CryEngine fork). Seems pretty good. Defold and Lumberyard both have largeish, full time teams dedicated to improving them, their licenses both are great for indies - neither have royalties or costs (Defold is 100% free - doesn't require credits, Lumberyard is free too but I think Lumberyard requires some credits in your credits screen (unless your game is rated M+), and can't use AWS competitors, but you can use servers you own), and they both fill the 2d/3d sides well. Defold can do basic 3d too (it is a full 3d engine under the hood, but 2d is treated as the first class priority for now), and in the near future may be very suitable for basic 3d mobile games. We'll see. Highly recommend commercial devs to check both out. Compared to something like Unity, Defold has much better performance and lower runtime cost. Lumberyard is pretty comparable to Unreal / CryEngine proper. It's a fork, and Amazon team has been improving it a ton.<br><br>Still really disappointed Monkey never really took off.
