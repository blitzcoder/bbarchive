It's functional, but does not do a good job at marketing compared to other sites. I've talked about what's wrong with the site and what can be done in other threads.

If the site does not do a good job with converting that traffic then the traffic is wasted, but even then I do not stop because it's in my interest for Mark to sell more copies if that means Monkey can be made better. If people get a bad impression because the design is bad then that's bad - face it, people are shallow.

This is the reason why those other tools refuse to support power users, and why I refuse to support Clickteam even by linking to them. Basically you are saying that <b>right now</b> Monkey is only friendly to coders, only coders buy it, only coders use it, so why should Monkey try to appeal to non-coders? (Why should Monkey try to get more sales because it seems futile to do so?)<br><br>If I were in charge of Monkey's marketing I would put a lot of energy into explaining to potential customers the dangers of relying on closed source software for development. The dangers of using tools which are "point and click" because of various reasons. Trust me - a lot can be done to make Monkey sell more copies. All sales boil down to is selling a dream. Ideally the Monkey site would sell the story of an idea: making games. I see <b>none of that</b> on this site. It's very bare bones and mostly just feature lists. Lists of things. Not story telling. This is a marketing disaster.<br><br>And even then. <b>People are shallow.</b> Just because a person is mostly a coder doesn't mean they are not. If someone thinks something looks terrible they will not try to dig deeper. An argument I get with some people who are coders is that they would rather do <b>everything from scratch</b> so the way they see it everything should be written in C++ and they would never dream of using Monkey even if it takes 10x longer to write everything in C++ and so on - these people can be targeted with marketing pages meeting their concerns and making it easier for them to rationalize a purchase. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
