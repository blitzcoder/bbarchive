We like to support platforms like these because we believe in it. We use our own framework primarily for producing commercial and maybe non commercial games and on the side we want others to benefit from this because we want Monkey to succeed and grow. And besides that it’s great fun.<br> Our priority now is to get our framework ported to Monkey and basically the engine mode is done. This engine is practically the same as the Blitz Max version but better and has proven to us to work really well for games like Defenstar.  So too soon, depends how you look at it. The more support and products for Monkey, the better as long as the quality is good is what we think. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Quite a while for BlitzMax to become stable and for Jake to test/research different ways to do stuff within BlitzMax.<br><br>Monkey and BlitzMax has a very similar syntax... but the "compiled" code is very very different, one thing which might work well in BlitzMax might not work well in Monkey (or one of Monkey's targets - example: You should not create new objects at runtime for Android).<br><br>I started this thread just to help people think about a few of these things... frameworks are meant to be sort of best practice, yet Monkey is still young so how can any practice been had yet? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But the time we will be spending on it is important. I don't want to spend time learning something that might be discontinued in the future.  That's one reason I support Monkey at the early stage, because I saw what Blitzmax have proven to be. <br><br>So for those who want to making their own framework, I think it's a very good thing to start. But as a customer/user, I'll wait for a while before I decide which framework I'll go with. For now, I'll do it on myown to learn Monkey. I believe strong understanding of the core framework would make it easier for me to understand the framework I'll be invested into in the future. :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

PITA!! (Esp. when Monkey itself was working fine on one target and not another!!!) <br></div>Get a spare computer (preferably a Mac) and install a CI server (I'm partial to Hudson). Ideally get some sort of test framework too, (you can technically use TestNG on Android targets, but it's a bit rubbish, as is maintaining tests in native code) or write your own xUnit test framework in Monkey. Writing a simple xUnit framework in Monkey is certainly doable and relatively trivial (took about 4 days to do one in BlitzMAX, I don't imagine Monkey taking any longer). While this setup won't cover all bases it will prevent regression and stupidity bugs, and certainly any cross platform issues (that tests exist for, natch).<br><br>Anyway, it's never too early to start on a framework. What else are you going to do? Throw all your code out and start all over again with every game? Of course not, that would be insane and counterproductive. Eventually you'll have a relatively complete framework which you can then A) release as open source, giving back to the community, or B) sell to the community for profit, or C) Keep to yourself as a competitive advantage. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You know, when I started with BMax, 2 years after launched as you pointed out, it felt kinda beta-ish!  But this is because I was demanding a lot from it (not technically, just from a reliability point of view) and using in new ways that needed bug-free performance.<br><br>I was going to use monkey at launch but, for various reasons I shan't go into, I couldn't; however now it feels like a good time to get on board plus I'm sure monkey is going to get even better in the coming months.  I'm quite excited about learning what it can/can't do and making a framework.  I probably shouldn't make a framework, and should use Diddy, it's just that I have this geeky side of me that likes making a framework :-)  Also I'm excited by the Box2D ports that have been going on, that's something I've been meaning to look into for a long time.<br><br>The only thing is I'm actually working on various projects with other people and so monkey is more like a hobby right now than a full-time thing, which is kinda a shame as I'd love to give it my full attention. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I can't fathom why people in this day and age don't have things like this automated, but there you have it. But we don't get to dictate how BRL develops software.

Okay so Monkey probably has too many platforms to make a coherent and still meaningful and useful framework that works on all platforms, but similar platforms (I'm thinking largely iOS and Android, maybe HTML5 if you target tablets) should have at least some love. :o&gt;<br><br>For instance the ability to enter input (like for a highscore table) seems peculiarly absent for a games oriented language, aimed chiefly at devices with no keyboards, it seems somewhat an oversight that no type of input dialog (along the lines of the EMCAScript prompt() method or the Android EditText). I mean you could probably integrate something like scoreloop (and probably should if you plan on making lots of games) but maybe for your first couple of games that might seem a little daunting (or overkill perhaps), and also there the point people already raised earlier that you might spend time integrating it, only for BRL to come along and break it the next update. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
