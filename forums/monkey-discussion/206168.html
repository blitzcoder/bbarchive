You will have a hard time finding an experienced artist that works for profit share. Some charge by item, per hour or for a whole project. So far i did whole projects where the amount and type of art was known upfront and the rates ranged from 150 USD to 800 USD. <br><br>You can help the finding process by making a list upfront where every item is described as best as possible. Size, style, length, color scheme, references, etc. This list you can hand a possible canidate so he or she can calculate the work load and what to charge. Also let them know how fast you need the work to be done. <br><br>Most artist also charge upfront fully or partially. Because they got screwed before, that is why.<br><br>Good luck with your search. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
