Has micro HDMI, USB and SD.<br><a href="http://www.rcatablets.com/tablets/11-maven-pro" target="_blank">http://www.rcatablets.com/tablets/11-maven-pro</a><br><br>It rocks for the price and is at the top of the low end tablets which makes it good to develop for as the average consumers is likely to have this kind of performance ( more then a few worse performance this tablet screams ). It plays games well. I just tried Sonic Dash and it works awesomely, smooth and fast.<br><br>I have to say having this 11.6" massive IPS display is sweet and just too cool for gaming. I can even use HDMI out to the TV. Oh my! I can so see tablets as the preferred gaming platform for many out there (say when couple with Bluetooth joysticks) . With the keyboard as an option gaming should feel PC like when using it. It comes with a docking style keyboard and in many ways reminds me of the Asus transformer. The IPS display is real nice and at 1366x768 just the right resolution for my eyes. It comes with Android 5.x lollipop and is real snappy navigating, browsing the net and viewing HD video.<br><br>For the price a sweet deal. ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

These devices tend to be larger and more productive with the keyboard addition not to mention a track pad. They have the appeal of simplicity, long battery life and lots of media/game power. Really a good device for all around daily use across many modes of operation. So I think its a market to target specifically. <br><br>The gaming side of these kinds of larger tablets is a topnotch experience and offers interesting possibilities such as head to head gaming (on one device) that you just cant get on a small display. In general I find the HDMI out and Bluetooth option in tablets to be worth noting . HDMI allows the tablet to become a sort of gaming console exploiting large displays and Bluetooth provides a path for input devices. Perhaps not a trend now but as these tablets seem to be much more capable then in the past a trend to watch for.<br><br>In testing the software I design there is no substitute for experiencing how it preforms on the actual targeted device or platform. When developing for Linux or OSX or Android I have used emulators and find them to be less then useful when developing games for example. The only way to know if your game for example is rendering a proper experience is to have it tested on the hardware and OS it was intended for and as the designer experience it for yourself. Sure for simple lightweight projects the emulation route can make sense, but for me I would like to avoid them. I use them when I have to but only when I have to and even then outside of emulating for Linux and Android not very usable for BRL development. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
