There's quite a few links you can follow to read up on them.<br><br>I'd also stay cautious about them. So many rip-offs out on the internet its not funny. Every con knows just what to say to make you buy in to their "product" which never produces anything other than an empty wallet with a very upset wallet owner.<br><br>Good luck with this, and if you learn more about them in either direction, please drop a comment about them here :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That may seem insane, but if you have a free to play game which can make 100k+ every day it's in the top ten then... you just have to figure out how to keep it there while making more than you spend. This is the money that all of these ad companies are fighting for. They want big networks so that they can fill ad space that the bigger devs/publishers want to pay for. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I understand your concerns over fraudulent Internet offers. <br><br>AdBuddiz is a reliable/trustworthy mobile advertising solution. We’ve been in the industry for over two years and have more than tripled our growth in this time. We provide a successful platform for publishers to monetize the traffic generated by their applications. <br><br>First and foremost, we are and have always been fully Google Play compliant. <br><br>Our advertisers do pay generally around $1 per install. They do this because they know we have a global publisher network, with quality apps and will be assured of increased installs. They’re willing to pay a little more for this. Further, being Android specialists allows us to get some of the highest paying campaigns. <br><br>We do want to grow our network, and to help our publishers achieve success using AdBuddiz, we ensure they receive a comparatively generous portion of each install. <br><br>If you have any questions or would like any further information on AdBuddiz you can always contact me directly at clara@...<br><br>Cheers,<br>Clara. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
