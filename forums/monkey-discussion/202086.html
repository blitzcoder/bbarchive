Monkey is a very small language. In less than a month I became familiar with most, if not all, of it's abilities. Someone who's never made games and is going into game making should probably have some experience with other sorts of programming and common data structures before attempting it.<br><br>That said, I have taught and am still teaching a person who had three-to-four months, college, experience with Python and VB.NET. And was very unfamiliar with common data structures. It took them a couple of days, but they learned a fairly large portion of the language, common data structures, and understood enough to make little game demos. Explaining OOP to them has been extremely difficult. However, that in my mind has to do more with theory and once that's understood, it's all about practicing.<br><br>In short, as far as I can tell, Monkey is not hard to learn. Even for those with limited programming experience. What's difficult for most people is understanding OOP at it's core. Which has, really, nothing to do with Monkey itself.<br><br>A little off-topic, but I've been and still am writing a free online e-book, of sorts, for beginners to learn these things and hopefully game development by the end.

I don't know if you knew this but trial and error, not asking on the forums every time something doesn't work, and actually problem solving yourself; <i>Programming</i>, will get you further and develop your skills more than getting everything answered for you.

Meaning that looking in source, the docs as they are, the forum, or the language reference is enough to get by. And it seems to me Monkey is not (yet?) aimed at beginners. Tough imo I think it one day will appeal to beginners if there is a way to help them past the initial road-block.<br><br>In the end when I want to make something fancy I will want to start to use external frameworks made by the community. Or code from these forums. Most of which has little or outdated documentation and examples.<br><br>Personally I would like a system or section of the site so that documentation &amp; examples can be added for both to official modules and to user modules.  <br><br>I'm not just sure a wiki would be the right thing, they usually tends to be less than fun to update once they reach a critical size. <br><br>I tend to write documentation in the code, yet there is no easy way to get it out into a structured &amp; searchable format - would be cool if monkey-trans could generate html or xml documentation, the system that exists is not too bad imo, with a little extra work I think it could be excellent. Not that it is a difficult thing to do oneself, it is just that the point of such thing would be to make it "official" so everyone uses the same doc system.<br><br>@Amon, I agree. Just ask, I think most in this community assumes the question has a positive intention. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Overall its very good and the examples really help explain much of what is needed. The things I see that is a bit of a shortfall is the general syntax referencing. One of the troubles I have had is just looking up the libraries, and language specific functions and what they do quickly. The "language" doc needs to be fleshed out a bit more imho, and a quick ref, when in the editor (like eclipse would be ideal) would help most people.<br><br>In fact monkey + eclipse with command line completion and auto doc would be pretty awesome :) .. maybe I'll make a template for it one day. <br><br>Mind you, I think its worth noting that the doc work that has been done is really good and deserves noting that it does provide a great base regardless. <br><br>For examples Id love to see something like AutoIT's (http://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/)  help setup where every function has a "cut and paste" running sample - this is probably the very best help documentation I have ever seeing in any programming system. Its very community driven too, which I think Monkey could emulate with its large BB following.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Dave <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
