Are the others compulsory?<br><br>With these sorts of things I just want the iconography to be clearly differentiable and preferably for multiple levels of notifications of what they did. So "stat up" pickups have a particular colour and shape and make a certain kind of sound and "stat down" differ. Also maybe do the classic text flying off or a speech announcement of the actual effect - "Speed Up" or whatever. What you've got looks okay to me although it all really depends on how the game plays and how busy the screen is etc. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Like, stupid clear. I think two squares is too much to analyse. A speed up is good, normally speaking. So that should be green (or blue, or glowing white, whatever). A pickup that has the opposite effect should be visually opposite, red instead of green or blue, surrounded by a black billowing cloud instead of glowing white, etc. Your colour system strikes me as ambiguous, especially if the player needs to evaluate two colours per pickup. Does playing your game really require learning a new colour coding system?<br><br>I wouldn't go for an in-between level. Any pickup that doesn't hurt you is a good pickup. If the player doesn't want them, they can learn to recognise them. Over time, I may learn that I don't want more than two speed pickups because my vehicle becomes uncontrollable. That's fine, they should still be green. Players shouldn't be in a position where they see a new pickup on screen and don't know whether to dodge or grab it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
