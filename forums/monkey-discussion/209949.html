That's one of the big problems of Monkey and its community (given the many people who I'm sure won't understand the point). Once you discover a product like this, the first things you want to check out IMMEDIATELY are the docs, showcase and community. Those three things can tell you at a glance how healthy a product is, and let you decide whether to bet on it or not. Now, while the community aspect of Monkey can be said to be more or less a point in its favor (at least the forums are active and people reply quickly), the docs are somewhat hidden (not a main menu link) and definitely poor, most of the times without any example, and the showcase is, well... what it is.<br><br>The thing is, with little it would be possible to improve things a lot. For example, placing the docs link in the main menu, and make them accessible with a friendly URL (since the docs are so poor they don't even get indicized, at least let me be able to access them easily, i.e. docs.monkey-x.com or monkey-x.com/docs). Make the docs a wiki or another form of community-editable content so that everyone can help and share the work necessary, especially with examples. Increase the number of entries shown in the showcase, this way even if there's a lot of crap, users will be able to spot the good entries from the bad by scrolling a little (instead of having to click "next" every two entries, lol). Just show me the damn things! <a href="http://screenshotsaturday.com" target="_blank">http://screenshotsaturday.com</a> as an (extreme) example, or something like <a href="http://www.yoyogames.com/showcase." target="_blank">http://www.yoyogames.com/showcase.</a> And place only the good ones on the home (landing) page! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

When you submit an app, the app is given 30 days(?) on the new section for rating purpose. if the app makes a rate of 3 stars or better after the 30 days then it's allowed visibility  in the apps section, otherwise the only way to access it is to search for it by name or a direct link in external websites. <br><br>I don't know if Mark paid for this website if he did, he was robbed.  its a half-ass job from somebody that was supposed to make it better than it originally was. in which IMHO I think it was made worst.

This is a problem with many people, though, and it takes a slick bit of shiny polish to overcome the people who pick at low-hanging fruit such as this site's presentation.  LÖVE 2d has a similar target and state of maturity, as far as I can tell it's comparable to MonkeyX for indie devs --  Its forum is small, its wiki documentation isn't too different from our documentation (save for the fact it's a wiki!!), and the website is the most basic 960 sell sheet.<br><br>So, what's different?  Well, Lua is known to modders, for one.  The main site doesn't <i>look</i> like it's trying to sell you something, even though it clearly is (even if you don't pay for it!).  The wiki is editable, and the documentation is presented in a slightly-more readable format.  Everything about the community from the source repo to the docs to the community has a bit of a fresher coat of paint all around.  What might help Monkey is a shift in demographic -- this can be done in many different ways, and mx2 seems to be going for the "quality user" way.  Attract high quality contributors with a new modern language. <br><br>One other avenue of expanding the userbase is to increase the number of people wanting to make games in Monkey by lowering the barrier to entry.  Mojo2 actually does the opposite of this at the moment compared to Mojo, but it's something that can be overcome with better documentation and more eye-popping games on showcase.  There aren't enough high-quality completed projects on the showcase, particularly ones with that "fresh coat of paint" to attract a younger demo.  Mark should totally try to get in touch with SlopeOak to get NecroDancer on the front page.  Same for 2dark  (even though that uses mungo).  These projects were made more possible with MonkeyX, they demonstrate its power.<br><br>Community might benefit from being spun-off from the main page, docs and main showcase.  Forums could be linked to a separate site where a pre-built solution portal package can be used.  App showcase could utilize a time-decayed voting system not unlike Reddit, to always have "hot" projects on the front page of the community site.  Main Monkey homepage should have a hand-picked showcase.   Community portal can display hot forum topics on the side, curated news (currently most of us get our news by trolling the forums here!), tutorials, and assets (free/paid products such as art, music, code).<br><br>Back in the day, when I was involved in Clickteam-related products community, mini blogs were popular before the word "blog" was a thing.  They were commonly called devlogs.  While it's probably not the best use of resources to host these kinds of things on-site anymore, it should be relatively simple to hook in social media links to a user's profile.  Being able to access a user's projects, assets, forum posts, and links to other places they can be found on the web in a pretty and straightforward way would be a boon.  Projects <i>could</i> have a news update portion, and a way for other users to be notified on-site when such a certain project's been updated.  Same for following a user's posts for assets or tutorials, or a forum thread you're watching.  A unified, but concise notification inbox helps draw people in to the "happenings" in the community.<br><br>I could go on more and more about this, but of course without a proper web developer (and maybe a graphics/interface designer who knows more about today's trends...), none of this is likely to happen ! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

New user here. Just wanted to say I find the website fine and checking out the apps showed me Monkey X is worth considering. However, it does require a person to use some common sense. I have been developing a long time now and know that graphics can look however you want depending on the art skills of you or your artist. So all I was looking for was fundamental features: can it render graphics? Check. Can it play music and sounds? Check. Can I easily program in it? Check. The rest is up to me.<br><br>I came here from Unity to assess Monkey X for development of 2D games. And I will also say you probably don't really want Monkey X to be as popular as you are all talking about. What happens is you end up attracting a mass of people who all they are focused on is getting rich quick through game development.  We see that all the time over on the Unity forums. This obsession with money, money, money. In contrast, the users here remind me of the good ole days when we created games and other products just for the joy of doing so.<br><br>Anyway, that is my two cents on it from an "outsiders"  point of view.<br><br>Is there an Introduction forum here where new users can intro themselves and why they are here? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Very interesting and basically seems to be the same conclusion I came to. I don't hate Unity or anything like that. I just think it is way overkill for 2D work. Personally, I find it to make development more convoluted = more time consuming. I miss things like Blitz when I could just code something up in minutes or an hour. Not set around dragging components all around the screen. ;)<br><br><div class="quote"> Playniax: Monkey can use a bit less negativity though! <br></div><br><br>Reading what I wrote I guess that does come across as being negative. Well... honestly I do have a negative view of that part because I remember well people spending hours doing this stuff just for fun. So when I see tons of people reading about Minecraft and Flappy Bird and start pouring in chasing pots of gold it kind of irks me. I will get over it. :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
