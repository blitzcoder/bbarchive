Without DirectX support you are making certain a still huge chunk of users won't be able to play your games, although this percentage diminishes every time they do their survey. GLFW may be enough for a Steam release if your game is core, but if it is not core then you had better make sure it can run on older computers.<br><br>Steam Greenlight is not a free pass onto Steam. It is only a popularity check. If your game is not popular Steam knows to ignore you, but even if it is popular if your game does not meet Steam's standards in terms of quality then they will not publish your game - unless the popularity is unbelievable, and in that case you don't need for your games to be on Steam. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

From what I've been hearing, its not easy to get your game into Steam unless they feel it meets their quality controlled criteria (whatever that maybe). Even with BlitzMax, there's only a like a couple of games that i know of that made it Steam. Unless i'm missing something, i havent seen anything develop in monkey that even targets the PC platform. Everyone seems to be targeting the mobile, or browser based platform, and I know Raz has one on XBL. However, the project I am working on is directly targeting the PC platform :). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
