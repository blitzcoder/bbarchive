So if I sold a product at even $2, I'd lose 14 cents doing it by setting tax =  0%. Now, really, I agree its not much initially, BUT what if you sold 100 units of said product? Or a thousand units of the product? Now, you start mounding up the amount of taxes at a higher rate.  100 units @ $1 each = $7, @ $2 each = $14, @ $3 each = $21... @ $10 each = $70! Lets try that with 1000 units @ $1 each = $70, @ $2 each = $140, @ $3 each = $210... @ $10 each = $1000! On a small scale, its not much, but grow just a little bit and it adds up fast. Just remember that you will lose the taxes out of YOUR pocket if you do not collect it up front. Thats JUST TAXES. If you are in business to MAKE money, and thats the purpose of a business, thats definitely not money you want to just give away freely. You can easily use all the extra income.<br><br>That's only the taxes part, don't forget you are also paying out fees to the vendor, so that's another 30-60% of your take - GONE!! That's depending upon whom your distributor is. <br><br>Let's look at this now too:<br><br>1 unit sold @ $1 each with 30% taken for vendor fees = 70 cents, plus take the 7% sales tax from that as well (because you set it to 0, and the gov't wants their money) 70 - 7 = 63 cents in your pocket.  This is just the simple math. Later you get nailed again for EARNINGS when you file taxes, so another 35% comes out. 63 x 35% = 22 cents in EARNINGS tax, so 63 - 22 = 41 cents left in your pocket. And... the earnings taxes go up with the more money you make; percentage-wise. Once you meet a given threshold of earnings, it will go up by 5%, so starting at 35%, then 40%, etc.<br><br>This is just for demonstration of not collecting sales tax at the time of sales. Someone has to pay it, why should you? You go to the store and buy something. They tax you for it. That store generally will not pay the sales tax for you unless there is a special event going on. And even then, its a hard find to see any store pony up sales taxes for all its customers.<br><br>Just think about it is all I am getting at. In the end its your money. :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So $1.07 x .30 = 32 cents, so you still pay 2 cents for EACH dollar in sales tax! At 60%, 1.07 x .60 = 64 cents, and now you are still paying 4 cents for each dollar!<br><br>I'm not entirely sure how Google Wallet works for the country specific taxes. My guess (without researching this more) is that Google probably already bases it off the country you are doing business in. Anything outside where you are doing business, it removes the sales tax. Don't quote me on that, as that is my guess how they do it. I'd need to brush up on Google Wallet to be sure.<br><br>Ok... So before I wrap up this post, I went ahead and located documentation about how taxes are handled in Google Wallet.<br><a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/138000?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Wallet - Specifying Tax Rates</a><br><br>Also, more information:<br><a href="https://developers.google.com/commerce/wallet/digital/" target="_blank">Google Wallet for digital goods</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You are correct that sales tax comes out regardless if you cover it or the person buying it covers it.<br><br>You are still losing money on sales tax. YOU are paying out sales taxes even with $1.19 and getting back $0.83.  <br><br>Check this out:<br><br>Your scenario is that you sell it for $1.19, and Google takes their cut of $0.36, leaving you with $0.83. Now you still need to cover the $0.19 sales tax AND the 30-40% INCOME tax. $0.83 - $0.19 = $0.64 and then you take out 30%. $0.64 x .30 = $0.19 INCOME tax, leaving you with $0.45 in YOUR wallet.<br><br>Let's do the math with applying SALES tax in Google Wallet. You sell it for $1, and Google charges $0.19 in addition to the purchaser, then takes $0.30 leaving you with $0.70 + $0.19 = $0.89. You send off the $0.19 to sales tax. Its NOT part of your income, as its viewed as sales taxes. The $0.70 is view as your INCOME and you are then taxed 30-40% of that. $0.70 x .30 = $0.21, leaving you with $0.49 in YOUR wallet.<br><br>This is only for $1! Imagine the amount you could add to your wallet?<br><br>Tell me that $0.45 = $0.49? You lost $0.04 on that purchase for each dollar it sold for. <br><br>Let's say your game sells well and it sells 10,000 copies. At this rate, 10,000 x $0.04 = $400 you lost to SALES TAX. Ouch. Thats only 10,000 copies. <br><br>What if it really sold well like Minecraft? 12+ MILLION purchases? This is TOTAL sales on PC/Mac, but to prove my point. Hmm... just for grins: 12,000,000 x $0.04 = $480,000 in LOST SALES TAX that could have otherwise been in their pocket had they gathered the sales tax up front. I bet they charge it up front too.<br><br>So, if you want to stomach losing money, go for not adding sales tax to your in-app purchases. I'm only trying to help you understand what you are missing by doing it that way. Make some money, and give only what you HAVE to give to the government. Pocket everything else :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You will only have income and no sales tax for those that purchase your products outside of your country. So this will be identified as INCOME tax and you will just be taxed that, not SALES. For those that purchase your products from in your country, then the SALS tax will apply and you will pay less INCOME tax.<br><br>Brush up on how your country expects you to deal with sales and income taxes, especially when you sell outside your country. I wish I could give you better assistance with that.<br><br>It seems that if you added the sales tax into the cost of the game for all non-French customers that you'd have some redemption on your taxed money, but it may hurt you that way too. This is why I say you should look further into how your country operates and expects you to deal with outside France sales and income.<br><br>Good luck getting this worked out! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
