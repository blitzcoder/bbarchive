The question is because I have seen that Mark is currently working in Monkey 2 but I am not sure how long will it take for it to be finished in a "production ready" way.<br><br>So what do you recommend? stick to Blitzmax until Monkey2 gets released or migrate to Monkey X while waiting for Monkey2.<br><br>Thanks <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I have already worked with Blitzmax, and plenty other languages + frameworks so getting to know another one is not going to be really that difficult for me. My main concern is actually spending money and time in a product that will be replaced real soon. I wouldn't want to invest in it, maybe also  in Pyro, and Jungle IDE to find out that the new monkey2 product will be out in 3 months from now on, unless I can migrate from monkey x to monkey 2 without too much trouble <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So, unless you want to donate to support future MX2 endeavors, you aren't forced to pay for it. Now, that doesn't mean Mark won't potentially make 1st-party products like 2D or 3D <i>'engines'</i>, for example. The point is, Monkey 2's going to be free to at least try, if not realistically use, so that shouldn't be a big concern. Not only that, but it's still a good bit out from being stable or at least comparable.<br><br>Now, Monkey 1 is a different issue. Monkey 1 is open source. When you buy Monkey 1, you're receiving other implementations of Mojo, and recently, Mojo 2. If you want to play with shaders, and/or target more platforms (Mobile, for example), then you'll need to buy Monkey. Of course, you'd also be supporting Mark and Monkey 2 if you decide to buy Monkey 1. The way I see it, you don't need to buy Monkey yet. If you just want to try it out, or you don't need the more advanced features of Mojo 2, then Monkey 1 is already available to use.<br><br>To my knowledge, there's no restriction on game sales and the like, so you're just limited target-wise. The other tools and frameworks are different, though. For example, Jungle IDE is free, but technically states that you shouldn't make commercial products in it (Without buying it). That's a weird detail that amounts to very little, though. If you do buy Jungle, you're getting a lot of extra features. I personally don't own Jungle, so I can't say too much about it. As for Pyro/Ignition, I've never tried them, but I imagine they work well.<br><br>It's all about what you're after. In general, I'd say you should try out Monkey itself, before investing money in it. If you want to try Monkey out, you can get the free version on the site. Or, if you feel like not having a good text editor, <a href="http://regal-internet-brothers.github.io/webcc" target="_blank">try it online</a>.<br><br>As a side note, if you find yourself liking Monkey, and want to migrate to Mojo 2, <a href="https://github.com/Regal-Internet-Brothers/mojoinmojo2#mojoinmojo2" target="_blank">this module</a> basically shows you the equivalents. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
