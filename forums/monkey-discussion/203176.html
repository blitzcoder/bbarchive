Maybe we could even do it as a 48/72 hour thingy one day? This is obviously open for discussion and change but as a start...<br><br>The rules are as follows<br><br>You can only use touch controls.<br>Diddy will be used as the base of the app and you will code your game as a single Screen ( <a href="http://code.google.com/p/diddy/wiki/Framework" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/p/diddy/wiki/Framework</a> )<br>Your game must be at the set resolution of X by Y (whatever we decide, but I think with mobile devices in mind)<br>You must only use graphics from the provide sprite sheet (I'm thinking a single 1024x1024 png file)<br>You must only use the provided sound effects.<br>You must use one of the provided music tracks in the background (if we have music tracks at all).<br>Your game must be score based.<br>Your game must provide scores for bronze, silver, gold rankings (and maybe an additional super difficult one?)<br>You must include a 32x32 png which will be used as the icon on the mini game selection screen. This must again be based on the sprite sheet graphics but can be edited to make it more suitable as an icon.<br>You must include a brief description (limited to a certain number of words?) explaining how to play the game. On the most part the game must be relatively self explanatory though.<br>You can only use authorised third part modules (if any?)<br>You must state (maybe via a requiresMultitouch:Bool in the screen class) whether the game requires multi touch or not. My thinking here is it could allow us to have a HTML5/Flash release and a phone/tablet release.<br><br><br>The result<br><br>I am hoping this will create a fun collection of varied games that we could release for free on all available platforms. The more mini games, the better :)<br><br>So anyone interested? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

</pre><br><br>Think that's about it ..<br><br>I still need to code the play button so it plays the currently selected game, and I still need to render the game info and screen shot out in the game info panel, once thats done everything else can be done within the individual game monkey files, and their own respective graphics folders.<br><br>EDIT -- OH one thing the texture packer, if you happen to edit it to add your own graphics, you need to open the .txt file and amend the top line to point to the appropriate graphics folder or it will look for your games sprite sheet in the main graphics folder.<br><br>erm....<br><br>hope this is all ok.<br><br>I use dropbox, and would love to move all files into a shared drobbox folder as it will make working together a lot easier.<br><br>Anyway. if your interested, and wana help make a mini game, please let us know, and we will give you a game number which will let you know which files and folders your editing. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
