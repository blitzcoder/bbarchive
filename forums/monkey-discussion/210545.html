I have since finished my high school education, and gone to college a couple different schools. My biggest passion has been game development, but I have spent a lot of time doing web development and learning about programming. I am now working toward getting my B.S. in Software Development because it is where my passion is at, so my question is should I get back into monkey and buy the $200 Studio edition which comes with Playniax Ignition engine? I am seeing that Pyro is now available as a successor to ignition does it come with Studio Edition or does it also have to be bought separate?<br><br>Question 1:<br>Should I buy the Studio Edition of Monkey X?<br><br>Question 2:<br>Does it come with Pyro or is that a separate purchase?<br><br>Question 3:<br>Would Monkey be versatile enough for developing software for multi-platform not just games?<br><br>Question 4:<br>Is monkey secure enough for using it as a way to make a living developing mobile apps and desktop applications, and finally HTML5 applications?<br><br>Question 5:<br>What sort of limitations does monkey have?<br><br>I ask these questions because if I could take majority of my development to one language, and then allow the ease and simplicity of development then I would like to do so. Also I am looking at Monkey because my g/f is looking to get into development with me, we are planning on making small games and educational applications for the mobile platform, but also looking to make desktop software. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Your site showing off Pyro really peeked our interest because if seems like a pretty powerful framework to be using, and I am definitely interested in owning it.. and you kinda answered my question about ignition and pyro, basically pyro is the future of monkey. I would like to get the better quality in development so I would focus on Pyro as it is taking advantage of Mojo 2 which allows for some really nice lighting and particle effects.<br><br>I guess the other question would be is there limitations to what can be created in monkey? I am currently taking some crash courses on getting back into understanding the language syntax, recently I have been using Java, and Python for software development in school. I understand the needing to build the GUI myself since there is not a built in gui library, but using just monkey code  I could create any type of software? Or is there limitations, the big target is going to be mobile games for educational and recreational time.<br><br>I am pretty set that if monkey is able to do just about anything you want to do that I will take advantage of the time it can save, and I already determined that I want to buy the Pyro Framework if I am going to be using monkey. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
