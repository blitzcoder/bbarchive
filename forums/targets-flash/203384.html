I wrote the start of this game a few weeks ago.. And it was nice and smooth when it played. I have the test stuff coming up in Chrome by default. <br><br>Recently I loaded up the project which I haven't looked at in a few weeks as I was on other stuff, and ran the same game from the same code and now it stutters in chrome. The old build stutters now too. I tried it in internet explorer and it's still smooth there. It's just stuttering under chrome all of a sudden. <br><br>I fear chrome auto updated and they mucked some flash speed thing up... But does anyone have any other suggestions about what might be going on and how I might fix it? Has anyone noticed anything similar recently? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's not a target I use a lot so I hadn't checked to see if it was a Chrome thing but I just did and Firefox is noticeably faster. I can't say I've noticed other Flash games being much slower though. I'll see if I can find a suitable test on Newgrounds or similar later. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Disabling that plugin alone fixes performance issues.<br><br>So, long story short: You should be OK using either the classic flash plugin for Chrome or the one by Macromedia. Stay away from pepperflash. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
