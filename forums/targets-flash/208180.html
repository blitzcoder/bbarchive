We’re all sad to see them go, they've had a great impact on the community and most of us at FGL used Mochibot and Mochiads in games we developed, and both Adam and Chris remember fondly the day when the creation of FGL was announced in the Mochi forums. We wish them all the best of luck.<br><br>On a more positive note, after chatting with the Mochi team about the situation in order to see how best we can help with the unfortunate situation we decided to write up an easy “how to” guide on transitioning from Mochi services you have relied on to comparable FGL services.<br><br>Ads and Analytic's for Flash<br><br>If your game uses our GamerSafe service, then let us know and we can immediately get ads running in your game, without any work on your end.<br><br>If your game does not have GamerSafe implemented, FGL has its own Flash in-game Ad service, cleverly called FGLAds. It’s a service that aims to provide all your advertising and analytic's needs for Flash web games. FGLAds provides you with an extremely easy way to implement ads into your game.<br>1. First, make sure you have an account on FGL.com<br>2. Head over to the Ad token page (https://www.fgl.com/fglad_manager.php) , and create a token with any name you want<br>3. Once you have done that, paste the snippet of code in your game and you’re done!<br><br>Any stats on your games will be reported at fgl.com/reporting.php (http://www.fgl.com/reporting.php) .<br><br>Right now, ads will always show, but in the near future we are going to provide this service as analytic's-only service too, so you can use it as you might have with MochiBot in the past.<br><br>A few useful links to get started:<br>* FGLAd Manager (https://www.fgl.com/fglad_manager.php)<br>* FGLAd Reporting (https://www.fgl.com/reporting.php)<br>* FGLAd FAQ (https://www.fgl.com/view_library.php?page=fgl-ads-dev-faq)<br>* Emanuele feronato’s article (http://www.emanueleferonato.com/2013/10/22/a-new-way-to-make-money-with-your-flash-games-fgl-ads/)<br><br><br>Leaderboards, Microtransations, and More for Flash Games<br><br>For those of you who may have been using Mochi for things like leader boards, you will find our Gamersafe solution (https://www.gamersafe.com/)  to be useful.  Gamersafe has been around for more than 5 years and makes it easy for developers to implement highscores, microtransations, achievements, social sharing, and level hosting for games. GamerSafe has over 2 million registered gamers and we've got a large directory of games that already uses our services that you can check out, like Berzerk Ball 2, Swordless Ninja, Async Racing, Mechanical Commando, etc.<br><br>A few useful links to get you started:<br>* Gamersafe FAQ (https://www.gamersafe.com/faq.php)<br>* Gamersafe Developer’s Guide (https://www.gamersafe.com/developer/gamersafe_guide.php)<br>* Sample Gamersafe Application (https://www.gamersafe.com/download/GamerSafeTest-FB3-1.0.zip)<br><br><br>Mobile Game Monetisation and Distribution<br><br>While this isn't something that Mochi was offering, it’s something that a lot of developers are asking about. The Mobile Platform we offer has a huge range of features available for developers who are venturing into the Mobile universe. We offer<br>* Wide distribution to a large range mobile marketplaces (android, iOS, nook, etc)<br>* Ads on mobile<br>* Cross-promotion of games on mobile<br>* API's to plug into proprietary systems like leaderboards, achievements, etc.<br><br>We are currently still in limited sign up, so if you want to find out more about the Mobile Platform, email Adam at adam@...!<br><br>If you have any questions about transitioning from Mochi products, or questions in general, please feel free to either ask questions on our forum (https://www.fgl.com/choose_forum.php) , or email us at info@...
