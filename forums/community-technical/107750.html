The later Core 2 Duo's were based on a re-design of the older Pentium 3 product line, and were faster)<br><br>- It's AMD who came up with x64 (as an extension to the old x86 instruction set) which made 64 bit CPU's popular in the market place. INtel's 64-=bit platform (itanium) was dead in the market since it had no backwards compatribility with any existing 32 bit software. AMD 's 64 bit took the market by storm, to the point trhat Intel ended up licensing x64 from AMD to implement in the intel CPU's as well. Without AMD we would have been stuck on 32 bit x86 a lot longer.<br><br>A huge reason that Intel is so much larger than AMD is thanks to them abusing their monopoly. When the AMD Athlon chips were technically far superior to the first generation Intel Core Duo chips, Intel leveraged their contracts with the large OEM's -- If Dell, IBM, Compaq, HP and others would even offer a single computer based on an AMD processor, Intel would revoke their volume discounts, pretty much doubling the cost for any intel CPU they would sell. Given the thin margins on PC's, it would price that manufacturer out of the market.<br>Intel was later taken to court over this and lost, which is why you now can buy Dell and Lenovo with AMD chips -- but this monopoly abuse prevented AMD from getting any significant foothold in the market at a time when they were undeniably the superior choice. While Intel was fighting all of this in court, enough time past that they were able to develop the Core 2 Duo in the mean time which was faster than the Athlons. They only won by essentially abusing their monopoly to lock AMD out of the market at a time when AMD could have eaten their lunch.<br><br>On top of the exclusive lock-in arrangements, Intel has also been fighting dirty with their compilers over the years. Many of the programming suites use the intel compilers on the back end, which was shown to be explicitly favoring Intel processors. Not just being optimized for however Intel CPU's work internally, Not just by only supporting extensions offered by Intel CPU's, but by actually ignoring and disabling capabilities on non-Intel CPU's<br>For example, the compiler would use use SSE3/SSE4 function calls if it saw opportunity for optimization, but ONLY if the CPU identifier was 'GenuineIntel'. Rather than checking if the CPU supports an extension and use it, it would ignore them completely.<br>The end result of that is that the same program could run a lot faster on Intel processors than those manufactured by AMD and others, even though there is NO reason to do so.<br><br>AMD has been fighting an uphill battle for decades, and it is amazing that they are still able to give Intel a run for their money.<br><br>(And hey, it's in everyone's best interest for there to be two or more strong contenders. If intel would end up being the only player in town, there would be NO incentive for them to continue to spend <i>billions</i> of dollars on advancing the technology to faster and faster chips and production facilities, they would just keep cranking out the same chips until the cows come home.
