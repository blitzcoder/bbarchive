Maybe you paid because of a given "deadline" - or because he does it "professionally" (means paying additional taxes, offers x-levels of review-correct-turns) ? Always assumed there are plenty of students lurking around for such jobs - willed to do, and skilled to cope with it (assumption that students are a bit better educated in grammar/spelling) - maybe I am wrong.<br><br><br>If you need a German translation for 10ct/word - feel free to ask me for help ;-)<br><br><br>Dunno how much I would need to pay then to get our game's database translated (&gt;35.000 words per language - for now). <br><br><br>@ (tu) ENAY<br>D'Accord with 5<b>.</b>00euros for 5000 words?<br><br><br>@ remiD<br>If you had enough money, you could "buy" time (by paying for things you do on your own - for now). So if you eg. do 1 hour overtime each day and get more by translating a text in that hour, you should do the translation. So consider that. And no, you shouldn't pay someone to do the "family time" with your wife just to save time of the day.<br><br><br>I think the time we spend reading+replying here will soon have consumed more time than it would have needed for one "French" to translate the desired text.<br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You sign a contract consisting of:<br>- amount to translate<br>- time do to the work<br>- costs per "change" (if one reconsiders the text to translate) - including added payment of xx/word<br>- guaranteed time for free fixes (you cannot "check" if you do not know the language - so upcoming "notices" of endusers need to get redirected to the translator)<br>- penalty in case of not fulfilling the contract (for both sides - so eg. paying 50% even if you do not use their translation - or the translator paying the costs for an "equal translator" in case he misses to fulfill)<br><br>This is imho the only reason to go to a (local!) company - because chances a better to have the "law on your side" - in case of problems.<br>Having an translator in another country makes it very hard to get back the money etc. (you need a lawyer in that country to sue one).<br><br><br>So yes, you are right that "reliability" is something which could be worth these 500 Euros. I assume it depends on your experience with these kind of translation services and the companies offering them.<br>(And of course - if it is _your_ budget paying the service)<br><br>Think this suggestions and the discussion about it also fit to the threads about externalized/outsourced asset creation (think Matty brought that up some months ago - didn't he?). Sometimes it is "you get what you pay for" - and sometimes you luckily saved some Taler :-)<br><br><br>PS: Why should one prevent glacial fog?<br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
