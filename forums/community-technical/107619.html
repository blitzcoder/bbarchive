But there are probably side effects (for it's still herpes-simplex) and may or may not hold off the cancer permanently.<br><br>There was this woman shown on TV were her legs were terrible affected and for now at least it was a great improvement.<br><br>They said it holds potential for usage on different cancer types too.<br><br><div class="quote"> <br>New immunotherapy gets cold sore virus to tackle cancer<br><br>On January 5, start the Antoni van Leeuwenhoek with a new type of immune therapy (T-VEC), the herpes simplex virus (known to cause cold sores) is used to fight melanoma.<br><br>This makes the arsenal of treatments against these very aggressive form of skin cancer further expanded.<br><br>T-VEC's been through all test phases and has been approved by US and European drug authorities. Unique to the agent that is a virus for the first time, forms the base of the drug. To be precise, the herpes simplex virus, known as the cause of the cold sore. The virus is so adapted that it can not cause more this condition. But it is able to kill cancer cells. If the room is sprayed in a melanoma, the virus will multiply in the cancer cells. Once the cell is bursting viruses, splash it apart and spread the virus to surrounding cells. In healthy cells the virus can not multiply. Thus, it is, very selectively, only the cancer. Furthermore, there is a protein built in by the virus that attracts immune cells. The idea behind this is that a local immune reaction occurs in which the immune system attacks the cancer cells will also attack.<br><br> <br><br>milder treatment<br><br>Surgeon Dr. Alexander Akkooi has, with his colleagues from the Antoni van Leeuwenhoek, the first new agent since early January, T-VEC, will apply in the Netherlands. From Akkooi: "As a surgeon, try cancer out as much as possible to treat locally, but it is not always possible to remove a melanoma surgically With T-VEC we now hold a new option to address the cancer locally.. before we move on to agents who work in the body, such as targeted therapies and other forms of immunotherapy. " Such local approach is milder. The risk of wide side effects is much smaller than with agents that act throughout the body.<br><br> <br><br>Combination<br><br>The agent will be available for patients with local or regional metastasis of melanoma in the skin, subcutaneous or lymph nodes (stage IIIB, IIIC and IVA), but without metastases in organs. From Akkooi: "The agent is in about half of patients effect average, continues to work for six months, we expect to continue to increase the impact and duration by combining the drug with other forms of immunotherapy, which.. works in the body. For example, anti-PD-1 therapy. This combination we also want to try. "<br><br> <br><br>very aggressive<br><br>Annually receive some 5,500 Dutch melanoma. This cancer is known to be very aggressive because it easily spreads. Once that happens is difficult to treat the disease. In 2015, 825 people died in the country from the effects of this cancer. Fortunately there are some entirely new treatment options in recent years been added that can prolong the lives of patients with metastatic melanoma, or even cure them. These are perzonalized medicines (also called targeted therapies) that very specifically targeting genetic defects in the tumor and immunotherapies, which spurred the immune system of the body to remove the cancer.<br><br><br>Source: News AVL <br></div><br>Translated from <a href="http://www.voorkomhuidkanker.nl/news/displaynewsitem.asp?SEARCH=&amp;PAGE=1&amp;NEWSID=%7BFEF392DA-4578-43B2-8DE0-251260983762%7D" target="_blank">http://www.voorkomhuidkanker.nl/news/displaynewsitem.asp?SEARCH=&amp;PAGE=1&amp;NEWSID=%7BFEF392DA-4578-43B2-8DE0-251260983762%7D</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
