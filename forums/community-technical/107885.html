It took the rest of the world almost a month to catch up with this?<br><br>In Germany, there actually is a LEGAL foundation for the claim that the service/"program" in question -- which is not Twitch itself, but the Twitch channel PietSmietTV - qualifies as a broadcast program, and that is defined in §2 of the "Staatsvertrag für Rundfunk und Telemedien":<br><br><a href="http://www.die-medienanstalten.de/fileadmin/Download/Rechtsgrundlagen/Gesetze_aktuell/RStV_18.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.die-medienanstalten.de/fileadmin/Download/Rechtsgrundlagen/Gesetze_aktuell/RStV_18.pdf</a><br><br>A this point, if you can't speak or read German or find a correct translation, a meaningful discussion will be quite difficult -- translating the involved "legalese" is difficult, and the folks who made that YouTube video in the original post of this thread got A LOT wrong and that disqualifies that video.<br><br>Based upon the legal definition of the "Staatsvertrag", and according to several German publications that dealt with the matter, YES, defining PietSmitTV as a "Rundfunkangebot" could be legally correct and the "Staatsvertrag" could actually be applicable to PietSmietTV -- meaning that PietSmietTV would require a broadcast license to operate in Germany. That's expensive, but not impossible to get.<br><br>The "Staatsvertrag" also contains clauses and definitions that describe when it is NOT applicable. PietSmietTV would only need to adjust its program accordingly - or the way how they make it accessible - and the discussion would also be off the table. They "only" need to make it interactive enough so that the consumers can change the course of the program -- because the linear, non-interactive nature of Twitch is what turns it legally into something that is governed by the "Staatsvertrag für Rundfunk und Telemedien".<br><br>It has absolutely NOTHING to do with censorship or with an attack on the Freedom of the Internet. MAYBE that specific "Staatsvertrag" is out-dated and should be re-evaluated, and the commission in charge admits as much - but also clearly states that unless the regulations and laws are not updated, they must apply the laws that currently exist. And guess what - even the founder of PietSmietTV publicly demonstrated an understanding for this decision and is investigating the available options to acquire a broadcast license.<br><br><div class="quote">  the Internet is meant to be a free place which allows everyone to participate no matter where they are <br></div><br><br>If it weren't for the fact that the Internet originally was created as a computer network for the US military so that the various divisions of the armed forces could better co-ordinate their efforts and resources, this statement would almost be funny. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

And that means easy votes to be won, so all parties would have to align with the population or lose an election. You can see this happen all the time, even if there's a hint of censorship people start going crazy (rightly so!).<br><br>I think they will just keep going down the route of smear campaigns to force advertisers to pull funding from content creators and make it harder for them to make a living. And governments will keep trying to claim national security reasons and blame it all on Russia :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
