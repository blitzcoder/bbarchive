You have less than 50 players in a 3 month period.<br><br>3. None of your players are ever on at the same time.<br><br>Does that suggest a multiplayer game with such constraints is completely unworkable...or is it possible with some kind of turn based asynchronous system to do it?<br><br>Can you with those limitations make a persistent online world of sorts?<br><br>Think outside the box for a minute.... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If they are never online at the same time, I can only see an asynchronous turn based game to one that could be played like that. <br>OR you create a server that runs your game world independently and the players jump into this world at will and will have enough to do there without the need of other players.

Maybe this will give you some ideas... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

To avoid "nobody starting at all" you either have all dungeons get deadlines or auto-increasing steps ("AI heroes")<br><br>- social<br>All players who took part in a dungeon solvement will get rewards according to their share on the 50 steps. Maybe add some bonus if you entered the first time or if you were the last one.<br><br><br>PVP is not possible asynchronously for "fantasy games" except you do some "turn based" thing with very long turn-intervals (like "play by mail" in the early internet ages).<br><br>So if you really have so less players online I assume you need to invent things which could be done asynchronously - together or alone. <br>- dungeons with "steps" or "progression"<br>- spell trainers which only train X apprenticeships/players per day (adjust by "avg online players"-amount)<br>- trade in this multiplayer should be done via vendors - people sell or buy and of course for others they are made available then too.<br>- persistence: certain quests could be solved by only one at a time but afterwards the next could do it too. Mobs slain could also be dead "forever" but to avoid an empty world the story could be containing some breed-caves where ugly mobs create new beings and these then use some dark magic ways to reach outer territories. Think a respawn is easier to implement ;-)<br><br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
