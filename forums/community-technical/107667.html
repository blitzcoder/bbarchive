I know I've seen the SE on DVD like once maybe twice.<br><br>I don't think I've ever heard the movie say Luke, just No.<br><br>Think about it, when you are talking one on one with someone, do you say their name half way through a conversation.<br><br>"Dave do you remember this?" or just "Do you remember this?" ?<br><br>The toys that say Luke I am your father probably do not have the actual movie recordings, but a redub (perhaps not even JEJ's voice) and if the toys were movie accurate it might sound daft hearing "No, I am your father" and people going "No, I am your father." can lack context vs the misquoted Luke line.<br><br>There was another one I saw a few days ago about 3PO's silver leg, various things showed two golden legs and TBH, I never paid any attention to him to ever notice the mismatch till around the prequels, specifically ep2 when he got it.<br><br>The toys were always uniformly golden as it was cheaper to just use one paint, Marvel comics might mis-colour both yellow by accident, perhaps doing it so often that they just abandoned accuracy if they ever got it right in the first place.<br><br>The on rail shooter shown in his video shows two golden legs, but again, released long after the original trilogy and maybe before the prequels, people might have forgotten about or even noticed his grey leg and remembered him having all gold like the toy.<br><br>IDK if the Moonraker girl had braces, last time I saw it was early 90's on VHS, so no "you can see IBM's logo in the 1080 edition of 2001" even if she had braces, I thought they fell for each other cos she was cute in her own way and she thought he was hunky or something.  Basically they made each other tingle in their underwear.<br><br>The only Mandela effect I can say I might have experienced was hearing about Stephen Hawkins death almost a decade ago, but that might have been me hearing a news report that was later rectified and I never followed it up, all I know is I said to someone or posted it here, that I heard he was dead, told no he isn't then some time later walked past him along Kings Parade after leaving the Eagle. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
