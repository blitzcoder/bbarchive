While waiting for an ambulance the mans heart stops beating and an employee who is certified to perform CPR carried out the procedure until the paramedics arrived to take over. A few weeks or so later, the restaurant and the employee received a letter from the heart attack victim's solicitor with the intention of taking them to court for damages for breaking their clients rib whilst performing CPR. The employee basically said "Go a head as you will lose, I am qualified to administer CPR and have up to date certificates".<br><br>Any good solicitor would have known that any place of work that has a number of employees, has to have a qualified person to hand that can perform first aid with current up to date certificates.
