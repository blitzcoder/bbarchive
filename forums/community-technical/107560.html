Normally, it's the part of programming which I most enjoy but not so much on this occasion.<br><br>The bug reared it's head when I'd set up a irregular scenario so I sort of stumbled across it.  This was actually quite fortunate as I wouldn't have known the bug existed otherwise.  <br><br>I followed the usual process of spending hours adding loads of additional on screen and debuglog information which I thought might be relevant.  Spent days wading through code, debug logs, writing screeds in my trusty note pad and today I finally found the b*stard!!!<br><br>Anyway, I just don't think non-programmer appreciate the satisfaction I now feel.  I wouldn't go as far as to say it's better than having a right good ***k but it comes pretty close :)<br><br>As you were.<br><br>Stevie <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You consider that a procedure/function is correct because it produces corrected results in many cases but not in all cases. And then you end up searching a bug in newly created procedures/functions when there is no problem there.<br><br><br>About debugging, personally, i use several approaches :<br>-&gt;make sure that the spelling of each variable/function (newly written) is correct<br>-&gt;make sure that the scope of each variable is correct (local/global)<br>-&gt;check that the flow is as wanted using debuglog()<br>-&gt;check that the variables are modified correctly using debuglog()<br>-&gt;check that the results of the calculations are correct using debuglog() and an external calculator<br>-&gt;use markers (images or meshes or pixels/texels) to debug visually what is happening <br>-&gt;split the procedure/function in smaller steps to determine which steps are correct and which are problematic<br><br><br>The frustrating thing is when you realize that the bug is not coming from your mistake(s) but from the language/engine...

There was no error but the camera was being positioned at Nan,Nan,Nan.  Had the game running all day for over a week producing logs etc.. and it turned out that the issue was with a global Pivot I was re-using for thousands of calculations each frame, including the camera positioning.  Eventually B3d just didn't like it.  The resolution was to reset the scale, position and rotatation each frame.  A bit of a cludge but worked :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

My procedures/functions to get a pixel/texel color always worked well in the past... The cause was apparently that the emulator was doing some hacks in memory and altering the values...
