In addition to our OEM partners, throughout the design of Windows 10, we’ve been working closely with our silicon partners, including Intel, AMD, NVidia, and Qualcomm, on collaborative engineering to ensure Windows 10 takes full advantage of new silicon features. We continue to partner with these companies on their roadmaps, to achieve breakthroughs in performance, imaging, connectivity, power, graphics, and more as the Windows platform evolves with them. The modern computing world is being defined by this deep integration between silicon, platform, and hardware and we are excited by the joint innovations ahead with these partners. Always, we want Windows to lead in both adoption of new silicon innovation and also product quality.

Here's some evidence..<br><br>1) Just try doing a clean install of Win7 on an older Vista capable hardware(= more resource hungry): You'll see it runs super speedy, giving you back that 'wow' feeling. <br>2) Then compare after installing all the updates, especially the ones that came out when Win8 was about to be released: It suddenly crawls ahead like a snail which had salt put on it's back and superglue on it's snail trail. <br><br>Coincidence, no intent?<br><br>It's something I've noticed with XP(SP3) also, but now became a bit too clear to me. This line of evolution promises to render all our hardware useless within the next few Win10 'free' and probably unstoppable updates.<br><br>This while I don't see any real need for something like the OS to run any slower or getting more bulky than before unless for things like gfx demands(higher res screens) or new features. But I don't see anything radically new in the OS that would justify this. Rather optimizations would make it speedier. Of course drivers for all kind of devices, could do it, but they don't require to be installed inside the OS for every system, just leave them on the install media until required and make the OS scalable to the devices capabilities until expansion. But of course this is not in the interest of the HW/OS creators, as in this way the IT business keeps the mill spinning.<br><br>3) Also check what silly thing they(W1ntel&amp;M$) did with the intel Skylake chipset: Suddenly they decided to take out support for anything below USB3.0 and for no real hw necessity making an install of Win7 on these systems, quite an illusive endeavor(USB driver injection into their images required).<br>See: <a href="http://wccftech.com/intel-skylake-remove-support-usb-based-windows-7-installation-platform-specs/" target="_blank">http://wccftech.com/intel-skylake-remove-support-usb-based-windows-7-installation-platform-specs/</a><br><br>Start saving I'd say. <br><br>Disclaimer: above text is not to be taken seriously and does in no way reflect or represent any of my real thoughts and expressions rather than that they are the rantings of a paranoid madman that had 1 too many.. ;-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It came with Windows 10, which I removed for my trusty Windows 7. It has a USB 3 port only, no USB 2 or CD-ROM. It did support Windows 7 as was stated in the advert, it even has a full set of chipset drivers for Windows 7 64 bit on the Asrock website. So I did what I have done before created a bootable ISO image on a USB drive. Stuck it in and hit reset, it booted fine(bios support was there), wrote the boot image to the SSD and restarted to initialise the full installation. Then bang, error, no Windows disk found it stopped reading the USB drive even though it booted fine from there only seconds before, the installation halted. USB drive was fine. Nothing would make this work.<br><br>After a bit(a lot) of investigation. I discovered, even though Windows 7 64 bit has full support for the BeeBox Intel chipset(including the USB 3 port) once installed, the MS boot image does not. No USB 3 drivers are included with the boot image. It has been removed by MS. Even using a USB 2 drive will not work as the port is dead to the boot image. <br><br>This means, that hardware that is compatible with Windows 7 cannot install Windows 7 as MS has removed the ability to install Windows 7 on compatible Windows 7 hardware. Madness.<br><br>The only way around is to inject the Intel USB 3 drivers into the boot image ISO via a patcher utility. This was almost useless as the the Intel patcher was very version specific so I ended up ripping out all of the compressed and signed windows ISO installation files and creating my own custom installation, a total PITA. <br><br>I have no doubt, MS knew what it was doing. Install Windows 10, easy peasy, install Windows 7, almost impossible for your average user. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
