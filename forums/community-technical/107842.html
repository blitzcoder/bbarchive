It involves blitzplus so is relevant to here.<br><br>In 2012 we needed to print out barcode labels from our ERP software for our warehouse teams. At that point we didn't know how to do so. <br><br>So we developed a solution of our own that took a text file from the ERP software, combined with a java and blitzplus program and passed the resulting image via irfanview to a network label printer to print the barcode label.<br><br>It involved much head scratching every time we changed warehouse setup/acquired a new location and so on.  It had config files, mysterious printer setup rules, network paths that needed to be accessible from certain places, a few variations on the blitzplus program and so on.<br><br>In short - it was horrid to deal with.<br><br>In 2015 I worked out how to print barcodes from our ERP - actually thanks to some help received from Henri and Dawlane and perhaps a few others on this site regarding CUPS, and a few commands to pass information as raw output to the printer.<br><br>In 2016 I built a custom barcode system for our ERP software using its built in 4GL code.<br><br>Today we have finally retired the last of the old locations printer systems that were using the old method.<br><br>Yay. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You make your plan, you build it.

Not the entire first floor, furniture, plumbing and electricity and then start the second floor.<br>Finally if you're going to change something, don't except this change to absorbed into the fixed time scale and magically take zero seconds of extra time unless we're developed in a alternate reality or worm hole. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Take it from me that it's nothing like that what so ever. And it's usually the architect, installations designers and the person that's meant to approve the drawings that screw the job up in the first place. It's not so bad if the company does everything in house as those on site will know each other and sort out the mess that those responsible for the design have caused. But as soon there subcontractors involved; then it's a different story as it comes down business politics and the general attitude of those employed by the subcontractor. And then there is the client, whom may want to add changes half way through the build which usually ends up with those on site having to tackle more design screw ups. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

A few companies don't like agency workers as the are expensive and are not always the best in terms of professionalism or are just chancers (a term for someone with no real skills but managed to pass themselves off as someone with skills to get work).<br>They have taken too much work on elsewhere and have to move personal around, reducing the man power on site. This in it self causes problems if it the person running the job gets moved as the replacement usually has to workout what the hell has been going on.<br><br>How well a subcontractor can cope in such situations depends on how financially stable they are. Many end up going bust because of constant bad contracts.<br><br>In my entire career in construction, there has only ever been one job where theory and practice came together. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The consulting geniuses just got out a book and said do this, then this, then this...   The one I still get a chuckle out of is they said that if there was any error at night requiring some kind of fix the programmer had to call the manager to get approval to put in the fix.  Managers and Programmers agreed on that one - do the change and tell the Manager in the morning.  And that was the level of genius the consulting team had for everything. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
