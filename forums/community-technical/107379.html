They take an investment of time, money, sweat and effort to create.<br><br>However users, those people we want to enjoy our creations, expect all of this to be done free of charge.<br><br>As an example - last year I released a game for a low price, less than $3. It had 10 purchases in 3 months. I then released it in the same market sphere for free and it had 500 downloads in a few days.<br><br>I don't know about you and how you would feel about that, but it sickened me.  I actually pulled it off the shelf after a few days as the downloads went up and up because I felt disgusted that the same group of people would value my work at $0 who were too cheap to bother paying the cost of a cup of coffee for something that required substantial effort to create.<br><br>I feel as if the artist/creator/developer deserves to receive some reward for their efforts. And for users to demand and expect things for free just feels abhorrent to me.<br><br>Am I behind the times?<br><br>Am I out of date?<br><br>Is it okay that I feel a sense of disgust at the sick nature of software developers being expected to produce free content by the masses for products that these same users would have no comprehension of how much effort goes into them? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Even though $3 is peanuts and we throw that out the window every day on senseless purchases, after a while even those $3 will sting if you suspect something might not be up to snuff. Nobody likes to be fooled, or rather, nobody likes to admit they were fooled which makes them even more "sour" when it comes to their next possible purchase.<br><br>Im not saying your game is crap btw, just calling it how i see it.<br><br>It would seem that to get any traction on Mobile requires you already have traction elsewhere, just look at how CRAZY people went for the shit that is Pokemon Go. <br>One either needs to fill an unfilled niche, or have something that wow-bangs people into blindly installing it on word of mouth alone, both hard problems :(<br>I would say the same is true for any saturated market like gaming, where only the big boys get to play because people already know them and they tend to scream the loudest.<br><br>On that note, if you look at the many successful Indie devs, they tend to release free games before they try selling something, and either have a small following or they have that niche you cant get anywhere else.<br>But this of course requires work and time, lots of it.<br><br>Or you can just do what Floyd suggests and go for micro payments which will fool most people into thinking something is free without it being so. <br><br>I might just be your polar opposite on this subject, so you might not like whats below...<br><br>As a rule i NEVER pay for things on app stores, but it has more to do with my disdain for the app store model itself than whats on them.<br>As such i am a proponent of Free Sofware (as in gnu) and Open Source. And i live by that, giving away whatever i make if anyone has a need for it.<br>I actually feel ashamed taking money for what i do sometimes, since its so easy and i actually like doing it! Though that doesnt mean i enjoy working for free mind you ;)<br>So i can see how youd want to get some of that investment back, but again, you were the one making something in the hopes of possibly selling it, which you IMO arent entitled to.<br>But i guess that is the distinction one has to make, is it work or is it a hobby? Or is it a hobby wanting to become work in the future? By realigning your expectations of what you want to get out of something in proportion to what you put in. Youve heard it before, but i felt you needed to hear it again.<br><br>Harsh words maybe, so please dont take them the wrong way, and i wish you success in any future endeavors :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I think we do differ.  I have bought numerous paid app games but refuse to pay in app purchases.  But then I avoid the self serve checkouts at the supermarket because I'd rather the big grocery chains employ someone (and the cost of the checkout is already factored in to their price).<br><br>I'm not about to disagree with you as I can see the logic is quite sound but I think the views come from different perspectives.<br><br>I look at it like this:if I go to the movies and put $2 in the arcade machine to play Daytona for less than 5 minutes....what is the difference between that and paying $3 for an app that will be of similar personal value.  Unfortunately.for devs we've devalued their efforts by providing so much for free.  And even if you find the effort easy there are media and hosting costs which a paid sale can recover.<br><br>Albeit you are right...no one forced me to put the game as free but the market expects it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Which puts things in different perspective, and i have to agree with you that they are similar in experience and cost for the user.<br>And i myself would not think twice about wasting money at an arcade (if they existed where i live that is), even though i would when it comes to mobile apps.<br>Which makes this rather weird, its like the platform itself as you say has been devalued.<br><br>But i still think it is possible to sell what you make and still have free software out there. It just has to be something people want or need. Or have that special allure with it like that arcade has. How to foster that though i have no idea :(<br>It actually reminds me of a Wine test i saw somewhere, where they purposefully mislabeled the Wines, and the tasters claimed the ones that cost the most was the best, even though it really was the cheapest wine. Its all about perception...<br><br>Back to too much free stuff.<br>This speaks to a larger issue in society, its like we are in a transition between the old "do the work, then reap the rewards" and something new not yet defined.<br>We as a people can already see the looming problems of automation in all forms of work, where it looks like no one will have work if this continues. Which then leads to the question whether money still is relevant in the future to come, or the very least the way we make that money.<br><br>Take for instance the idea of universal income, where every citizen in all walks of life would receive a flat income for simply being alive. Not enough to be able to drive a Ferrari around of course, but enough to be able to live like normal people. A place to live, food, and the things we need in todays world.<br>And for those that want more, or dont want to sit on their ass all day could then do actual work.<br>The fact is, not everyone needs to work, lots of what we do is stupid drudgery only there as an excuse because we still cling to that old adage that one must work or die.<br><br>Im getting way off topic here though, so excuse me ;) But these are the things i think about hehe. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Why would anyone buy a game that they cannot sell as used? <br><br>To sell something, you need to trust your customers, and they need to trust you.

There was no reason why BlitzMax and Monkey coudn't coexist and Monkey was just designed for the upcoming mobile markets at the time. Can't blame the guy for trying to get a piece of that market share. Monkey 2 is probably the result of listening to the Blitz people who were saying that Monkey X is bad which btw simply isn't true. And it would really be a shame if BRL disappeared. I guess people appreciate things more after it's gone. And knowing that you can already support Mark starting from $1 USD a month. Isn't that worth already the time you spent here on the forums? At least it will help him with covering the hosting costs ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

BRL are one of the very few companies to provide the indie coder with such a wealth of software compilers that with some application can allow nigh on anything to be achieved. I get a great deal of satisfaction and reward from coding with BRL products and I cannot forsee this stopping anytime soon. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
