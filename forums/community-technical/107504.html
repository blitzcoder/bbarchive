It can be valuable but even the best intentioned and most reasonable and valid criticism will bruise the ego a little.  The danger of criticism is it can discourage creative types such as mainsworthy from continuing creating.  People learn and improve at different rates.  If we look at another forum member,  Xilvan he totally ignores all criticism positive and negative and just goes about his work blithely ignoring everything.  However not everyone is like that.  Most of us do want praise if we are honest rather than negative feedback.  On Derrons side his criticism is perfectly valid.

It "tints* whatever is drawn.<br><br>So this is why you need to have the sprites in a light gray tone - it just allows the most variations. A nearly black image stays nearly black as you cannot increasy brightness as easy. But drawing a nearly white one with "setcolor 50,50,50" will darken it properly.<br><br>My Dig-framework contains code to colorize only gray parts of an image. This allows for easier team colors. Of course you could also have a base sprite plus a colorizeable overlay.<br><br><br><br>With reusing sprites i was talking about interface gfx or hex tile borders. In most cases only units and texts change. Maybe a textbox more is added...but in general things are pretty constant. This means they could share code...and theming/assets. <br><br><br><br>Bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
