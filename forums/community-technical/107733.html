I fly paragliders competitively and have to keep within a certain weight range for my glider. In flight, my all up weight is 110kg which includes my naked body weight, clothing, helmet, instruments, harness, reserve parachute and the physical weight of the glider (4kg). My glider has a top end "in flight" max weight of 115kg so gaining weight is an absolute NO-NO for me. I cut out sugar, starch and salt (SSS) and I find I lose weight and then have to binge to get back within my 90kg body weight. I also exercise quite a lot climbing mountains with 20kg kit on my back.<br><br>So.... if you want to lose weight, cut out sugar, starch and salt (SSS) and do some moderate exercise. It absolutely works for me. :) Basically it means (SSS) and eat moderate portions of red meat/chicken and veggies.<br><br>P.S Forgot to mention I am in IT and sit on my bum most of the day at work. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
