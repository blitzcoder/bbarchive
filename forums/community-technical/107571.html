I myself don't do any paid advertising.<br><br>Basic marketing breaks down to what we call the four P's.  They are <b>p</b>roduct, <b>p</b>rice, <b>p</b>lace, and <b>p</b>romotion.<br><br><img src="http://www.purelybranded.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/The-Four-Ps-of-Marketing.gif"><br><br><b>Product</b><br>You should have a well-defined idea of what kind of customers you want as well as what kind of customers you are not trying to attract.  This is called a market segment, and if you don't know which one you are targeting you don't have to worry, because you won't have many customers at all.  You should have a main idea of why people would want your product.  You can be the easiest to use, the most advanced, the fastest, the cheapest, etc. but you have to decide which you are.  If you say you are all of those things you will be known for nothing, so it's best to choose one thing and keep repeating it over and over.  You'll find that this comes back and affects the decisions you make in development, because you will be faced with a choice that either reaffirms or contradicts what you say your core value proposition is.<br><br>Your product is a <u>solution</u> that <u>solves a problem</u> for a <u>specific type</u> of customer.  You don't have to know every detail on the chart below, but you should have a good idea of who your customers are.  You can probably think of your own custom parameters that are suited to users of your product.<br><br><img src="http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tutor2u-media/subjects/business/diagrams/marketing-segmentation-bases1.jpg"><br><br><b>Price</b><br>Good consumer price points are $0.99, $1.99, $4.99, $9.99, $14.99, $19.99, $29.99, $49.99, and $99.99.  Sometimes developers will want to go a little above that because it makes you feel like you are getting "extra", but the same psychology that makes you want to go a little above $9.99 is the same psychology that makes the customer want to be below $10, and they are the one making the decision whether or not to buy your product.  When pricing products you should think in terms of price X quantity because that is what determines your revenue.  The demand curve is a measure of the number of people who will purchase your product at different prices, and typically looks something like this:<br><br><img src="http://floriankugler.com/images/Demand-curve-9b76b609.png"><br><br>As price increases, quantity demanded decreases.  Sometimes you can make the most money at lower prices, so a higher price does not always mean more revenue.  Optimally, we want to select the price at the point on the curve where revenue is maximized.<br><br>This can all sound very obvious, but when you sit down with a notepad and start putting your ideas on paper you will be surprised what comes up.  You can always go back and change things, but it's good to have a working guide that keeps you on track and keep it written down.<br><br>To be continued... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So if you sell a really long-living-and-working-product you need to take this into consideration too.<br><br><br>@ Market segmentation<br>For BlitzMax the target audience was clear: (casual/arcade) game creators. For monkey the target audience was (casual) game creators (mobile + admob etc.).<br><br>Things like maxGUI came later on - or as "to-buy-module". They were created out of need - or because there was a userbase which was big enough to create some sales.<br><br>To advance with your "next language" into a higher level is a normal behaviour - imho, as the people of today know more about computers than some years ago, they also have easier access to knowledge - might even have learned basic OOP in computer courses at school (I only learned (Borland) Pascal there). Also competition defines what might be minimum features. <br>Creating desire out of nowhere (think of smartphones, think of all these small inventions you cannot remember to have seen and needed some years ago) is hard - and wont happen that often with computer software - especially not with programming software.<br><br><br><br>PS: is there a special reason for this thread?<br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

(again, read the posts by Yue, about his use of pirated softwares/games) (nothing again the man, just observing)<br><br>Also, concerning impulsive buys, the mean of payment is important, it is often boring to have to create an account and to have to fill many fields before completing the buying process, but if you can instantly pay with a paypal account or with a call/instantmessage by phone, the process is easy and fast. (but the problem with calls/instantmessages by phone is that the fee of this payment service is still too high)<br>It is important to keep the interested person in the right internal state (feeling/mood) imo.
