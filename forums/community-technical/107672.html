I use my (work) notebook for EVERYTHING. My company smartphone (Galaxy Note IV) and my Kindle Fire HDX tablet are only inferior alternatives... for web browsing and maybe eBook reading. Because that's all those mobile gadgets are even remotely usable for. I can't fucking type on a touch screen - and I type A LOT every day. Writing more than an SMS on a mobile gadget is torture for me - and even typing an SMS feels like an exercise in finger breaking on those ridiculous touch screen "keyboards". It might be a different story if that stuff had been around in the 1980s when I was in my teens, but since it wasn't, that technology simply isn't for me.<br><br>PCs and what they're used for might change, but they're not going away. The progresses in tablet/smartphone development has stagnated or, if you want to give it a more positive paint finish, it has "matured". Meaning there's not that much left to explore and develop. There will be the next big thing somewhere down the road, but it won't be a new tablet or smartphone. Yes, it won't be a new PC either.  It'll be something else, maybe a new kind of wearable technology, maybe some "surrounding" technology that doesn't even need to be worn. But still, what we have now will still be used in certain ways because it occupies niches that are best served with those "legacy" devices. And unless this Canonical and Microsoft vision of real hybrid devices (read: smartphones that can turn into full blown PCs) because an everyday reality, I just don't see how e.g. accountants will ever do their jobs on tablets... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Because I am the admin of their linux OS. Maybe they trust it more than their android "china-distribution" or "Windows OS" (Windows Phone).<br><br>Also web surfing via a smartphone is like using "lynx" - it just does not have the same comfort as a desktop browser + hardware keyboard + mouse.<br>Because of an OSD-keyboard your screen space gets limited, because of limited screen space you cannot work with favorites+icons+tabs. Yes, you could but the elements are that big (resolution is unimportant as device size determines the "real-world-dimension").<br><br>Then mobile views to websites differ to desktop ones (you do not get all options).<br><br><br>So you end up surfing like an ape: visit a new page ? click on the link. Want to see the old page again? back back back back ...<br>What? <br>On desktops it is totally common to eg. click all interesting ebay articles with middle-mouse-click or ctrl+click -&gt; new tab.<br>Then you just visit all tabs until you think it is interesting.<br><br>You do not do this on a smartphone - even if it has 2 or 3 gig of ram. It just does not stay "fast" then.<br><br><br><br>So back to my parents: they use the smartphone for whatsapp ("ohh grandson is so sweet") or to read news, because _reading_ is what smartphones allow for (this is what others here in the thread already mentioned). Even PDFs tend to just look awful on smartphones (too small - or not displayed properly). Epubs and other "flow-able" text formats (like raw html-paragraphs with font-styling) are working good on a smartphone. They also use it to get informed about incoming emails but they do write their replies on a normal computer (if it is more than an "ok?"). They just avoid that small on-screen-keyboards as much as possible.<br><br><br>I myself do use the smartphone for a bit more - just because I "can". So I have a terminal installed on the phone - just in the rare cases of needing to ssh into my servers without having a computer next to me. But I would not use it at home. It is just inconvenient. I also have some IT-related tools installed (wifi analyzers, SSL proxies etc.) but it is just something which is not possible or not convenient to do with a desktop PC (laptops could help - but do not fit into my pocket)<br><br>Even writing here in the forums is inconvenient with a tablet or smartphone. I use it to read topics or to give short replies but hey... writing blitzmax code with the onscreen-keyboard? with all the special keys being hidden in second-level-screens. Or they need a landscape-mode and a tablet (full 102+ key-layout).<br><br><br>Argh no ... smartphones are for mobile communication and entertainment (games, taking some pictures), but for serious things (if communication isn't your day-job) I would prefer and still suggest a desktop computer.<br><br><br>Wonder how long I would have needed to type this post on my smartphone.<br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Listening to MP3s. Then came digital cameras came along, watching slideshows etc etc. I remember having my first printer and scanner with my first Pentium PC. Now you can just plug your tablet or use a USB stick and stick plug it into a colour printer in a photo shop or convenience store (in Japan anyway) and print away.<br><br>20 years ago, I also had a Playstation, loved it, but it could do NONE of the above. Mobile phones, smartphones weren't even a thing.<br><br>Back then, there was so much that a PC can do, and what ONLY a PC could do. You couldn't do any of this, you could do some (albeit not very well) on a Risc Acorn or Amiga.
