I had a great time in Blitz until about 2007, 7 years of fun times. Living with my parents was great, even if I didn't make too much cash, I had no rent or bills to pay.<br><br>Sadly though as I approached 25 (or maybe earlier) I started getting cabin fever and other worries such as never meeting new people, never going to get a girlfriend and other stuff, such as the games I first made probably never even going to be played by anyone, even myself and then eventually due to old hardware, perhaps impossible to even play.<br><br>Long term, games are great but unless you have 3, nobody will even remember what you did.<br><br>Now I have fun making stuff at work, but I couldn't care less about the end product, in 1-2 years the servers will shut off and it will die anyway. So Matty you need to have the fun of making and not of the end product, it's the way of the world. The coders of Armalyte for instance, I remember that game, loved it, but here is the thing, I never gave those coders money, I never will and I don't even know who the guys are. In other words, even if you get social recognition, it's not going to help pay your bills.<br><br>In the end, as humans, being social and having a secure future sadly takes priority over everything. If you can find a balance between programing and life then that is great. I wasn't able too.<br><br>Now I'm happily married, good income and living in Japan, my dream one could say.

(social recognition) became more important to me as I grew to become part of the facebook culture...I think something about being part of online communities lead me to value the social recognition that game making provides - which admittedly 10-15 years ago it was rather unique to make games and my friends were an audience who would play them....although as they too grew older and grew out of game playing and into responsibilities such as parenting - we had less time for social game playing (I play board games these days).<br><br>I think personally my interest in games has declined as I've aged but I've still hung on to the desire to create games...I think somewhere along the line though I've become less excited about many games including my own and so the motivation factor is disappearing....<br><br>....however I have other creative pursuits - writing (I wrote a book recently), drawing (I still update my website with pictures almost daily), and for a brief time I started learning piano.<br><br>But for some reason game making holds a place in my heart that I cannot quite let go of.<br><br>I actually enjoy programming my own personal and private web applications that I use on my phone or elsewhere and this too gives me a sense of satisfaction....<br><br>So I think my programming needs for creativity are gradually being met by other creative endeavours that are more private and kept to myself.<br><br>That was a bit of a ramble...but it says a few things I think. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's just that sometimes reading your posts, you remind me of myself.<br><br>I don't think motivation is your problem, you have a whole ton of content, gallery, code archives, blogs, you've completed several projects. <br>You're certainly one of our more active members.<br><br>And you mention you're also writing a book, drawing, doing websites, piano. You're busier than I am, and I thought being in Japan, I had no time.<br>However what it comes down too is that you appear to have no trouble<br><br>All the creative activities you mentioned are all activities that require full input from you, else nothing gets done.<br><br>As I mentioned before, I knew even in my mid 20s that something was wrong, I didn't have a shitty job, I had the best job, listening to my own music, games programming.<br>Working on what I wanted to work on, protected by my parents, I should have been the happiest person, except I started feeling unhappy.<br>I was going through a mid life crisis and yet not only did I not realise it, I didn't really know what the solution was.<br><br>It was back then I started learning Japanese, then I wanted a change of scenery, so I became a student in Japan learning Japanese.<br>After that I became a games programmer, and after 2ish years of that. I even started to learn Korean, then I met someone.<br><br>What I've just described is the same as you, I kept focusing on new things, always trying to do new challenges, changing with what I was working on with something, new, fresh and challenging. Everytime I started to feel that weird feeling, like I had used up my motivation, got bored. I quickly changed to something else to stop those feelings from getting stronger. I kept hobby hopping. Moving on before I got bored, but in hindsight it was a vicious circle<br><br>Whether it's psychological, or mental I don't know. These days I can't be bothered to learn new programming concepts unless my job forces me too, it feels like I'm lazier than ever, not creative at all.<br>Yet I feel happier than I've ever been, and scariest of all, this is how I used to feel before I became 18 and had to become an adult.<br>I was the same back then, I spent way too much time playing games and enjoying life and not studying or working so hard, and now I'm doing that again.<br><br>I think for me it was when my mum was looking after me as a kid growing up, and when I became an adult I needed to venture out and find my own way in the world. And that's perhaps what the solution was for me, it's connecting with people. First it was my family and now it's being with my wife.<br>Literally nothing has changed in my life except for living with my girlfriend and then getting married. I remember complaining here on these forums about my job years ago, it's still the same job.<br>Yet I don't hate it at all anymore. If I have a shitty day I know I'm going home later to see my wife, just like when I got bullied at school and knew I'd be going home to see my mum and dad, and play games in safety at home.<br><br>For now, I don't seem to suffer like I did, for the past 3 or 4 years. Those feelings might come back. I don't know.<br>But I had writers block, lack of motivation. I poured my whole being into being creative and when you do that, if you have a down day you have nothing else to fall back on.<br>Variety is the spice of life, it seems. Maybe it's because when I get home I have no time to mull over things, no time to spend hours on the Internet.<br>I don't even use the net at home anymore, and I feel much better for it. <br>Interacting with people. Whether this is what you're lacking in your life I dunno, that's what happened to me anyway. The less time I spend on the Internet the better I feel about pretty much everything. It seems you're pouring your heart and soul into your work, so of course when you put an app on the store and it doesn't seem to get noticed, you feel hurt, because you've put all your love and effort into it. You seem like a great guy, a social one, and you do it here with us, like minded people like yourself, even as far as bumping your own threads which extra posts, you're craving for our attention sometimes, or at least it seems that way, since you seem to after more human interaction. <br><br>As an example. Why did you suddenly change conversation from programming motivation towards your word creative website? You were eager to keep the chat going, even if it meant changing the subject.<br><br>Maybe, if you spend a bit more time NOT being creative you might find yourself being creative when you come back to it. You might be secretly wanting to get married or have children but don't know how and instead just focus on creating games instead.<br><br>It's just a thought anyway, but a lot of people when they start getting older start to feel this way if they've been alone for a fair while. You might be suffering more from lack of human interaction than lack of motivation. I know because it happened to me, it's just that at the time, I didn't know it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
