Partially because success story are doctored to make the mediocre feel like they can too to turn them into zealous obedient of the whatever current form of the system. An actual deep look into the life of all major genius reveal crazyness, mental health issue running in théorie familly, or enormous Struggle to life. For exemple, sir Isaac Newton was far from being the carthesian mind propaganda paint him as.  It make sense that to overreach, you must either be unfit for the system, or stuggle within it. Well rounded people are people who fit the system, as such cannot challenge it, especiallly in Time of collapse where the status quo become obsolete. I'll take a Stephen Hawking any day, glad he wasn't aborted because a lazy whiny baby eugenist coule not achieve what he did. Human have evolve to take care of the weak, it's natural selection, because their is an adventage in doing so, experimentation in lab have shown than a population of super individu are more prone to catastrophic failure than a diverse one, and this has led to the current explosion of performance in AI, ie introducing random defects made the system learn faster. And that's also how natural evolution work anyway. Why eugenist want to remove scientifically proven adventage from the solution pool is Beyond me. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

After all we are just very weak monkey, we had to make tools to compensate. It can be seen in almost anything science and art, Langley was a rich well connected man who paid many eminent scientist to be the first to make human flight a possibility, history remember it as a loser because he lost to a bunch of farmer boy who hadn't a tenth of anything he had.
