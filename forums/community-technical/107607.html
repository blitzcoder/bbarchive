Something had perused my photos and recognized that three of them were of a very long barge, much too big to fit in my camera's field of view. It realized these were parts of a single extra wide scene and stitched them together into a panorama. The level of technology is very impressive as is the invasion of privacy. It obviously looked at all of my pictures to find this opportunity. <br><br>There was also a blithe assumption that I would be pleased by this. There was no attempt to hide what happened.
