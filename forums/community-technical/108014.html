The courts consider it a proven fact that they were a monopoly, and abused their position to crush any competition. (It's not illegal to be a monopoly, but illegally leveraging your position is)<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp." target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.</a><br><br>Anyway -- like it or not, the rules ARE different for a monopoly than a non-monopoly. There are certain things that are OK (albeit annoying) for Apple to do, that are ILLEGAL for Microsoft simply because Apple doesn't have a monopoly while Microsoft does. Without that distinction, corporations would become unchangeable, especially when they can leverage their monopoly in one market  (desktop operating systems) to become the standard in another (Internet explorer, which for a while became the defacto standard browser on the internet. THANKS to the court action, MS had to compete on their actual merits when it came to web browsers, and as a result they now have a much more realistic 22% market share for IE on the desktop, and 5% for Edge. without the restrictions, they could easily have become the one and only gatekeeper to ALL content, which is in no ones best interest (other than MS share holders, perhaps)<br><br>Part of the settlement required microsoft to follow a very stringent set of rules, and time and again they keep getting caught not complying with the court orders.<br>(e.g. they had to offer a browser selection screen in the EU giving people a choice between IE, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, and the next 5 most popular browsers in the market, aranged in random order to not give IE any unfair advantage. MS complied, but as soon as the next service pack came along they reverted all settings to make IE the default browser again, and got smacked down in court once more for that.)<br><br><br>Don't like to play under different rules? Very easy fix for that: don't repeatedly and provably attempt to screw over everyone else by abusing your monopoly position. MS has no one to blame for their 'treatment' than their own choices.<br><br>Unfortunately, their oversight period is coming to an end, which is why you see Microsoft testing the waters and trying to actively restrict your choices once again, like with Windows S. They've learning nothing from the past. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
