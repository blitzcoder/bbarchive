A typical setup may contain two extended types;<br>1.	Type AllHexs  (methods for manipulating the map) extending Type Hex with data fields<br>.HexX (top left x co-ord)    .HexY (top left y co-ord)     .HexType (terrain type, hill, forest etc)   etc<br>2.	Type AllUnits  (methods for manipulating the units) extending Type Unit with data fields<br>.UnitOwner (who owns it)   .UnitType (Tank, art, inf etc)   .UnitMoral (unit's moral)   etc<br>For unit location, I could put a field in Type Hex called  .UnitNumber  (unit number or say 255 if empty), or a field in Type Unit called .UnitLocaton ( hex number the unit inhabits or 9999 if unit destroyed)<br><br>Running my games reveals that it is more likely that I will need a function that has a hex number as a starting point than a unit number, at about 50:1.  A routine embedded in a few of my games, reveals that the user is more likely to initiate a change with a known hex number than a known unit  number  (100:1,  yes this is becoming a real niggle).  This would indicate that I should use .UnitNumber in the type Hex.<br>However as games increase in size and complexity more changes to the board based on unit number are occurring and more space is wasted storing effectively zero. Not a problem on boards in the low hundreds of hexes but across a thousand hexes with say 60 units ? And of course starting with unit number and requiring a unit’s location from this requires a trawl through all the hex’s looking for that number.<br><br>To avoid wasting memory and the Hex trawl, I tried  .UnitLocation in the Type Units, this produces acres more code as I am continually having to start at a hex location and trawl through Units.UnitLocation to derive a unit number in that location. Note this is a much shorter trawl as there are many fewer units than hex’s. I have just tried doing both at once, that is storing the same data in two fields, Hex.UnitNumber and Unit.HexNumber, this not only looks bad but feels bad. (It’s easy to alter a unit’s location in one field and forget to alter it in the other field).<br>This has led me to write common functions that alter both fields to get around programming errors and this has brought the following solution to mind.<br><br>A super type dependant on Type AllHexs and Type AllUnits and declared after them called say BodgeIt that extends  the Type UnitPos  with fields .HexNumber  and possible some others etc<br>Thus (mouse) eventX and eventY are sent to a method in Bodgeit which converts to hex number via a method in AllHexs<br>And a quick trawl through Bodgeit.HexNumber to derive a unit number (if any) and then manipulate based on the data in AllHexs and AllUnits.<br><br>I am simply asking which method the people at the top of the hill found most effective. IE The people who sit supping nectar and munching ambrosia before leaping from peak to peak without oxygen mask or fur coat, while I sit wrapped in furs at base camp wondering which way to hold the ice pick. Not that I’m grovelling.. Hope you can follow this and that I’ve not been too verbose, any input welcome. Have fun cps <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Keep your units in a list or something, and use the tree to quickly search for units based on position.

(if you do so, and delete eg. the hexTile and the unit without resetting their individual links, they will stay in memory forever -&gt; memleak)<br><br>But what is possible, is a "soft link". This means  you eg. store the "id" (or another unique identifier) of the hext tile in the unit.<br>If the hex tiles have coordinates, you could store the "tileX,tileY" in the units. When a unit then needs to access certain data of the tile, it could ask the "THexMap" to give it the corresponding tile.<br>Of course this adds some overhead and it is slower than a direct reference.<br><br>On the other hand you could have a list of "currently owning units" for each THexTile.<br>Using this approach eases the pain for "drawing visible tiles + drawing visible units" (visible units are either "flying" or are attached to a tile).<br><br><br><br>@ trawls<br>This happens as soon as you have to decouple things. Indirection and the likes are the result. In my game I use "base types" which could be used by other types (import filex.bmx) without knowing about the "extended type" which does the real work (eg.the extended type could use the "base type" of another object kind without "cyclic dependency").<br><br><br>@ hexnumber, unitnumber<br>The problem here is "they are numbers". So if you change A you need to change B too.<br>If you use "objects", you reference them.<br><br>So this auto-handles changes (bad example, as it contains a cyclic dependency - car needs to know about wheels and vice versa):<br><br><pre class=code>
Type TWheel
  Field parentCar:TCar
End Type

Type TCar
  Field name:string
  Field wheels:TWheel[4]
End Type

global car:TCar = new TCar
car.wheels[0] = new TWheel
car.wheels[0].parentCar = car

car.wheels[0].name = "testcar"
print car.name
</pre><br><br><br><br>Back to the question of "who needs what kind of information". Imho you should go from "Map -&gt; Tile -&gt; Unit". Another approach is to have "Map -&gt; Tile" and "Map -&gt; Unit" - with Unit storing the ID of the tile it is on, so it could ask "Map" to get additional information about the tile. If it is allowed to retrieve them - eg possible Movement directions - then this decouples "tile" from "unit", a unit just needs to know whether it could move, not at which location (x,y) or in which animation state a tile is. So a Map is telling a unit if it could move right or left or which tile types are in range.<br><br>But let's wait what others think of it.<br><br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I may not have made my point clearly enough so an example using 1000 hexes and 100 units.<br>Creating an array with everything in it based on EventX, EventY converted to suit the arrays dimensions (x=0-25, y=0-40) gives quick and easy access to all data from any event initiated by a mouse click on the board.<br><br>What about events that need to change/interact with the array that are triggered by an off board button. Such as, click this to illuminate all units that are out of ammunition?<br>Or (by the game code) at the start of your turn the code tries to remove the disrupted flag from all your disrupted units. Such events don’t have an X,Y value.<br><br>The only way to derive the X,Y value (on which all on board drawing and data manipulation is based) would be to trawl (iterate) through a thousand bits of data until you found the unit/units and derive the X,Y from that.<br>IE Trawl through the supply fields until you find supply=zero, find X,Y of that cell, Use X,Y to draw the 'out of ammo' symbol on the unit.<br>IE Trawl through the disrupted fields find a set disrupted flag, find X,Y of that cell, use X,Y to obtain data that affects recovery from disruption, depending on result redraw unit with/without disrupted symbol.<br><br>The same problem arises if I create two arrays one for unit data and one for terrain data, the advantage being that I only have to move one piece of data (a unit number) when moving from Hex to Hex and I don’t have 900 empty data blocks (every block containing a cell for each byte of unit info) in my terrain/board array. The same problems apply to my application of the method of putting data into one or more types.<br><br>Of course I may be missing something fundamental, if so please excuse my stupidity. Thank you all again for your ideas, next time we meet I may be holding the ice pick at the correct end. Have fun cps <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
