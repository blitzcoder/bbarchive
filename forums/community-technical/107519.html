The problem of knowing how "horror movies" try to shock.<br>Graphically I think it was way too pixelated. Dunno if the "PS4 pro" will do better (he talked about it - and that he already ordered one because of some better anti-aliasing at the polygon borders).<br><br>Hmm, so for me it was just a "rail shooter" with some unrealistic looking "zombies". They looked not unreal because of some "uncanny valley" but because of their "CGI quality". They looked artificial / puppet-like.<br>This really destroyed the whole VR experience for me.<br><br>It wasn't that much the low resolution (I would compare it to a "next gen" N64) but really things which just look odd: like sitting on a chair, hands cuffed. Looking to the left you see a shoulder "peeking to somewhere" - obviously not yours. A psychopath is holding a knife in front of you - trying to cut the plastic cuffs with it does not work. Why?<br><br>When driving that lorry-thing I felt that "up and down" made me think of "falling and raising" a bit ... not much, but it worked. As the speed of the waggon was high, the low resolution and "dull" graphics did not gain much attention, there just was not that much time to look at it. When then moving slow (the portion in which you were able to shood that clothing-puppets) I used the time to look a bit at the environment. You knew that on the left and right things will happen and you concentrated on how lights were used. Using darkness is a cheap effect to raise "excitement/suspense" - but not if you are used to it.<br><br><br><br>In Batman I tried to throw ninja throwing stars at my butler - did not work. Why? I tried to "not hit" the target but still hit it (to ease difficulty I think).<br><br><br>So without having tried more than this - and a cardboard solution on a windows phone (mine do not have gyroscopes in it) with a similar experience (!) I think all of these devices are rather equally good or bad - it just depends on what you play.<br><br>If the games would really allow things you want to try, then of course interaction and immersion will be better - until then they are not able to soak you up into their world.<br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You can enable the camera so it shows a edge detection camera view beyond the grid wall, so even if you're in a game you can for instance see where your desk and water bottle are, and accurately reach for it without having to take the headset off.

They're working on retina tracking that fixes that issue, but that won't be coming in at a consumer price point any time soon, I don't think.

Also got to play around with the Vive at the same store and optics are about the same as the Oculus....though i hear there's a bit more clarity quality with the Oculus...can't really compare from the short experience so far. However, you can't beat the room scale VR and the Vive does have superior tracking. I ordered the Vive and should be getting this friday (yay!). As for the PSVR....haven't tried it. Will probably just straight up buy it whenever it becomes available again. But from consistent reviews so far, I keep hearing its not up to par with the Vive or Oculus but it's definitely a great entry point into VR.<br><br>Currently, my best VR experience is the <a href="https://gallery.leapmotion.com/blocks/" target="_blank">Blocks</a> demo while using Leap Motion. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
