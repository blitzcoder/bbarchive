No idea how dated it is but hopefully it's a starting point.<br><a href="http://www.simplehelp.net/2006/10/08/10-os-x-finder-alternatives-compared-and-reviewed/" target="_blank">http://www.simplehelp.net/2006/10/08/10-os-x-finder-alternatives-compared-and-reviewed/</a><br><br>Coming from an old-school power user of explorer approach as D4NM4N seems to be (non power users never use the keyboard, and it's pretty old school IMO to cut/paste as your primary method of file movement...) here's a philosophical suggestion that might help better understand the finder, and by extension be less enraged by it's conventions.<br><br>The finder is designed with 1 consistency and 2 intended methods of use.<br>The consistency is EVERYTHING can be done with a mouse with 1 button. There are plenty of things you can do with keystrokes, or right clicks, etc. but absolutely everything can be accomplished with the left mouse button. This is an old old design from when the mac was first created and has carried through. This is largely (imo) why the mac gets it's "easy to use" moniker, you can't click with the wrong button if there's only 1... This is inherently more basic than one might expect as a power user from linux or windows where 2 buttons is almost mandatory.<br><br>The 2 intended methods of use are:<br>1) The single window approach (largely pushed since OS X)<br>2) The multi window approach (which was the standard prior to OS X)<br>By multi window I mean if you want to move something from point A to point B, you need a window open at point A and another open at point B. To this end mac OS of old (and today with settings tweaks) didn't open folders in the same window, every folder you opened got a new window... it got messy which is why they've moved away from it but it's still a concept that macs are inherently designed around. It's often easier to work in multiple windows at once than try to do EVERYTHING in one, especially if you're working in 2 places at once.<br>The OS X focus has been on a single window however to keep with the mac's "look in more than one place at one time" approach they use the columns view as the default view, allow 1 window to show multiple folder contents in a path at once, not just the contents of the top folder of the navigation path. The second tool to help specifically moving files in a single window approach is the spring loaded folders. If you begin dragging some thing(s) and hover over a folder it will open, you can then hover over a folder inside that and it will in turn open, allowing you to navigate while dragging...<br><br>Hope something there helps! If all else fails there's probably a way to get a GUI you like running under X11 straight from the linux world :0)<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The keyboard is an excelent augment to the mouse, but it is far less intuitive to the uninformed (give your mom a keyboard and ask her to navigate a HDD) and requires a large base of knowledge to be able to operate smoothly. Enter being rename instead of open is not an inherently flawed idea, it's just different that what windows has trained people to do, opinion and preference are all that matters for an individual so they are vital for choosing something you're comfortable with, but they can't be applied to all people. I prefer command backspace to delete for trashing a file because it prevents accidental deletion. Part of the design concepts may feel like training wheels when you're used to blasting around your computer linux style with root access, but those same choices keep the OS from being either daunting to the uninitiated (for general use obviously) as well as preventing people from making mistakes they don't understand (my cat brushed my keyboard now all my files are gone... I've received this exact tech support call from the same guy 3 times in the past year...). I WOULD like to see an option to customize the keys built into the OS but I think everything everywhere should be customizable :0) I'm sure you can get an application to do this already if you really can't live without enter being open...<br><br>I can't stand the layout of windows explorer details view. When I sort alphabetically I expect my contents to be sorted alphabetically, NOT grouped into folder or other, and THEN sorted alphabetically. This is not intuitive, it's counter intuitive. Why can't it calculate folder sizes without me getting info? I'm more likely to have a big folder than 1 single massive file, if I care about size I care about folder size too. Smaller fonts are not better, they're just smaller, lots of new computers ship with font zoom enabled these days because so many people have a hard time reading the default windows font size... You can change the icon size in detail view on a mac, you can change the font size, you can toggle columns... in Icon view you CAN have it auto wrap (tell it to arrange by in the folder's View Options found at the bottom of the view menu...), hell you can set a background image for the folder if you like so you remember where you are... If you really need large icons to see a particular folder's contents more clearly that's what cover flow view is for...<br><br>Regarding scripting you can script the pants off the finder if you like with apple script and automator (and via apple script you can call shell scripts if you like etc...). Using automator you don't even have to program to make a lot of things happen... for example I have an automator action watching my downloads folder, whenever I download a particular file type it moves it over my network to another computer where I store that stuff. I can right click anything and throw it over the network to other computers as well through another automator script...<br><br>I appreciate the consistency argument, that when you set something up you want it to be like that everywhere... except where you don't which is where this falls down. Unique settings for each folder is specifically a power user type feature, and bemoaning it as confusing is counter to bemoaning the rest of the features for not being power user friendly enough... This is just a personal taste issue, either you like to set it and forget it, or you want control... and if you don't go mucking with individual folders it uses consistent layout so I really don't see where the problem comes in...<br><br>Regarding design, having not used Nautilus I don't know what he means by being able to select what the left column shows, but changing the left column seems again to be counter to NOT wanting to change the folder layouts specifically...<br><br>This has all been a rant but I hope there are a few useful tips in there somewhere (specifically check your view options window if you don't like something in finder...). Finder is not without fault by any stretch, but saying it's worse than explorer because it conforms to different standards that apple created before windows explorer came to be in any modern form is just opinion... you may not like those standards, in the same way I don't like the explorer standards, but I don't think explorer is bad because of it... I think explorer is bad because it crashes and anything that crashes is bad :0) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
