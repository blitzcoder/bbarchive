Mac appears unable to tell a disk drive from a printer apart. I never heard something silly like THAT before.<br><br>Of course, I am fully aware I had no drivers, so I googled them. Well I end up on the HP site and they say that I can get them by using Software Update. Well we all know that Apple dropped that feature and does all software updates through the AppStore now, so I took a look there, but as expected the AppStore showed nothing.<br><br>After googling lots of times I finnally found HP Printer drivers on the website of Apple itself. I checked and they were for Snow Leopard, Lion <i>AND</i> Mountain Lion, so I downloaded that. It was a DMG file containing an installer, so I ran the installer.<br><br>I wanted to make a test print and I tried to add my printer, but the list of printers that popped up was....

I don't use it much, but I still have things on CD-ROM. My wedding pictures to name something silly, but one of my former editors requires me to keep a copy of my books on CD-ROM. Well the ones they published that is).<br><br>I don't know if it were the drivers I downloaded that suddenly appeared in my list or if it got it from the printers internal drives, in the end it worked, so all's well that ends well.<br><br>For course I already thanked Brucey, but of course thanks to all of you who replied as well for thinking with me.
