The press release is below, but in a nutshell, iDevGames has teamed up with Freeverse Software, a noted publisher of Mac/Win original titles on this contest. They normally run "uDevGames", a much bigger game development contest at this time of the year, however, with uDevGames moved to a new summer schedule, iDevGames decided to start the "OMG Cup" contest. (http://idevgames.com/index.php/contest/omg_info/omg_cup_2005) I think even non-Mac developers can join in the fun because with the right tools/frameworks/etc, a savvy Windows/Linux developer can produce a Mac binary for entry into the competition. With uDevGames, they gave away over $70,000 in prizes to past developers, with many of them going on to professional work in the industry -- OMG Cup is on a smaller scale, but I think interest will be just as great. If you have any questions on the OMG Cup, iDevGames or uDevGames, please let me know."<br>Regards,<br><br>Here's their PR<br><br>LSL<br>----<br><br><br>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br><br>iDevGames and Freeverse Software Announce the Start of the OMG Cup Contest<br><br>ZENTSUJI CITY, JAPAN -- OCTOBER 18th, 2005 -- iDevGames, the Macintosh game developer website, announced today the first "OMG Cup," sponsored by Freeverse Software. Open to any and all game developers, the contest seeks to identify the best original Mac games (OMG). The OMG Cup is designed to help developers successfully release their games and to help the Mac game market evolve with innovative new game concepts. All qualifying entrants will receive a free game from Freeverse Software, and the top three finalists will be awarded cash prizes. The first place winner will also receive an option to turn their winning entry into a finished product -- either as a shareware or retail product.<br><br>Ian Lynch Smith, President of Freeverse has said, "We're very proud to be the sponsor of the first annual OMG Cup. Encouraging new Mac game development is more vital than ever, and no one has done more to foster that development in recent years than Carlos Camacho and the community at iDevGames.com."<br><br>Any game that has not been released publicly prior to the official start of the OMG Cup contest, runs natively on Mac OS X, and that does not exceed 20MiB (20,971,520 bytes) after compression, may be entered before the entry deadline on November 28, 2005. Entries will be initially voted on by the public from December 1, 2005 to December 8, 2005. The top six games will be evaluated by a nominating committee with the three winners announced on December 12, 2005.<br><br>"This is an amazing opportunity for any Mac developer," states Carlos Camacho, Editor-in-Chief of iDevGames. "It is difficult for both independent and small developers to break into the world of high profile casual game development. We have pulled together an amazing sponsor, Freeverse Software, to make this dream accessible for any developer. Building on the success of our annual uDevGames contest, we see this as a crucial evolutionary step in our grass-root effort to energize gaming on the Mac platform."<br><br>The official rules and more information may be found at:<br><a href="http://idevgames.com/index.php/contest/omg_info/omg_cup_2005" target="_blank">http://idevgames.com/index.php/contest/omg_info/omg_cup_2005</a><br><br>About iDevGames<br>Established in 1998, iDevGames' mission is to educate, support, and enhance the Macintosh Game Developer community.
