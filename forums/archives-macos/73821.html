Mac applications don't use function keys at all, that's a Windows thing. After a while on OS X, you will find it very disturbing if for example F4/F5 don't change the volume, but will instead do... nothing.<br><br>I don't know what you mean about BootCamp. Despite the name, it won't boot WinXP for you; it will just help you resize the OS X partition and boot the XP installation CD. Once XP is installed, you can choose the startup partition either in System Preferences/Startup Disk or you press the alt key when you hear the system gong when you turn on your Mac. This will show you a boot manager in which you can select a startup volume.<br><br>Coming from XP, it'll probably take you around two weeks to get used to OS X. The best advice is: In OS X, think straight forward, without all the detours that Windows imposes on you. On the Mac, you usually don't do Copy-Paste or right-click-save-as. You just drag and drop and things usually are where your intuition tells you where they should be. In some regards, however, Leopard was a step-back and the developers changed some things just for change's sake, not because they made more sense. The new dock sucks. But other things, like the Finder, improved.<br><br>Anyway - welcome aboard and enjoy your MacBook Pro! :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It really depends on how complicated the application is and whether it needs to use files from other locations or various other things set up, such as file associations.  Some programs, such as MS Office, have a proper installer.  The utility to create an Installer comes with OSX/X-Code, or you can go down the DMG route for your own projects, as most do. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
