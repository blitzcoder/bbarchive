Doesn't take away from your main system, no chance of booting the wrong one accidentally if it's unplugged, and you can use it on other computers for recovery, or testing etc. just handy to have.<br><br>That said to anyone running Lion, I would urge you to upgrade to Mountain Lion. It's just lion with a LOT of fixes and features that should have been in Lion from the start. THAT said, snow leopard is still way better as a power user OS, but the times, they a-change or so I've heard.<br><br>P.S. anything PPC based at this point is definitely legacy hardware and shouldn't factor into your targets unless you have a specific need. It's a headache of legacy management (especially across architectures and legacy OS versions) and paying users (generally speaking) have newer hardware anyway. Once apple officially drops something it's safe to move on in the Mac world, and they killed off the last bit of PPC support in Lion when they axed rosetta (stupid move IMO since it was install on demand in snow leopard and meant much better legacy support for those that might need or want it with no real development cost for Apple, just let it sit there...) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Apple has officially discontinued PPC support, and a few years is a LONG time in the OS world :0) I've always been a huge fan of supporting everything possible (larger customer base is always a good thing), but you need to go 3 major OS versions back to even have PPC app support. and 4 versions back (10.6) PPC was dropped from hardware support.  so unless you explicitly support leopard (10.5) users will only be on Intel hardware anyway, and on leopard most users will be on intel regardless. Anyone who Bought an OS (not just hardware, but even OS upgrades) since august of 2009 is running intel hardware. Anyone who bought hardware since 2006 probably has intel. Also looking at the specs of PPC based hardware they're all pretty darn old and dated, obviously the OS is way behind. It just doesn't make sense to spend development time and effort on a dead platform, especially one where people aren't buying new software (they can't no one makes PPC software any more).<br><br>Macs have always loved external media as a boot option, unlike windows where it requires quite a bit of hacking (although windows 8 supposedly can do USB installs now finally, thought I wasn't able to get it working last time I tried). Take advantage of it! A full system on a nice fast USB stick makes fixing things SOOOOOOOOOO easy. You can run the drive tools etc. but since you've got the full OS you can also move files around easily, get on the internet to get help, etc. Much easier than a repair console, or utilities boot where you need another computer to look up instructions.<br><br>RIP PPC, was a nicer architecture IMO, but it's time in the mainstream has passed.<br><br>Interesting side bar: Microsoft switched from x86 in the Xbox to PPC in the Xbox 360 right around the time Apple switched from PPC on macs to x86... In fact the first Xbox 360 dev kits were just Apple PowerMac G5's since they used the same processor it was as close as they could get until they finalized their hardware specs.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The former don't game at all, and the latter can afford better gaming experiences than a unity web player... and again, that number of visible users is &gt;5.5 times that of PPC users...<br><br>Certainly there are other factors, but I would be shocked if 1 sale in a thousand of even a casual game, and ONLY looking at mac as a platform, was PPC... when you factor in windows as well where you're majority of sales will typically come from for just about anything because there's 9 to 1 more PC users... 1 in 10k might be PPC mac? how much development and testing time is that worth? I love me some legacy support, but there comes a time where you just have to spend your resources on something more productive. RIP PPC. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
