Apart from upgrading to the latest version of the OS, are there are other obvious tips/tricks?<br><br>Any info would be appreciated. Ta :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

As is true for BlitzMax programs on Windows, you will still need a 3D accelerated graphics card before programs will run at an acceptable speed, plus OpenGL.  Having said that, you can still download graphics drivers seperately from the manufacturer of the graphics card.<br><br>Are you experiencing any particular problem? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This is now happening when a Blitzmax game is being run on their machine, best example I can give I'm afraid. So no idea what advice to give after saying, upgrade your OS. Since I don't have any problems.<br><br>Do you have to update OpenGL manually on the Mac too? (As if it were the DirectX of the Mac?)<br>Sorry for the gay questions :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Have they provided any system specs?<br><br>Like DirectX on Windows, OpenGL is the standard graphics API on the Mac, so comes pretty much as standard along with the OS and the graphics card drivers.  Upgrading is simply a matter of downloading the latest graphics drivers.  However, I have never had the need to manually download graphics driver and have simply used the Software Update feature of OS X to keep everything up to date (more the OS rather than the graphics drivers).<br><br>If they are trying to run it on a system that doesn't have a 3D card or OpenGL, then the app might just quit, although I would have thought that the user would have got an "unable to set graphics mode" error or such like.<br><br>To be honest, I've had little or no issues and am something of a Mac newbie myself, although I have been using them for a little over a year.<br><br>I would suggest getting as much of a system spec off the people having problems as possible and then posting them here.  Maybe myself or someone more in the know will be able to provide a better likely cause.  At least try and get the OS version and graphics card, which should all be available from the "About this Mac" option in Finder. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
