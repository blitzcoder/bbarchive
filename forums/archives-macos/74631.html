It is the only Mac that shows good performance with not stability issues at all. <br><br>My girl friend's iMac G4, although it is well within Apple's system requirements and ran quite nicely with Tiger, is now sluggish.<br><br>And my 2GHz iMac Core with 2GB RAM crashes at least once daily. Today, I made the mistake of watching a movie in VLC 0.8.6d. First, the movie stopped, then the entire Mac froze. Yesterday, I made the mistake of opening a JPG file in Photoshop Extended CS3 - system freeze. The day before yesterday, I made the mistake of copying a file from the internal hard disk to an external Firewire hard disk - system freeze. The list goes on like that.<br><br>The difference between the PowerBook installation of Leopard and the others is that on the PowerBook I installed the new OS from scratch on a freshly formatted hard disk. The two other installations were updates of existing Tiger installations.<br><br>I will now try the same on the Intel iMac, although I really hate to do that. There is so many stuff on that machine, that it really is painful to re-install everything.<br><br>If that also does not improve the situation, I face the decision of either downgrading back to Tiger OR dumping the entire Macintosh system. Tiger on Intel was not overwhelming either, but it ran much better than Leopard (which is not difficult). Adobe confirmed that they will give me a free crossgrade to Windows versions of my licenses - ONCE. Windows XP runs very well on that iMac, so I could go back to Uncle Bill with my main working horse.<br><br>Or I sell the iMac and buy that nice little HP Pavilion m9080 Quad Core machine with 3GB RAM and a 512MB GeForce 8600GT for 949 Euros that caught my eye and upgrade it to Vista Ultimate (or downgrade it to XP as well?). I can image that Photoshop CS3 will run very nicely on a Quad Core CPU (it's doing quite well on a Quad Core Xeon workstation with HyperThreading at work). Propellerhead Reason will probably also be fun on that machine.<br><br>The killer argument against that move are the bunch of Mac-only software products that I've bought in the last couple of years. Some Shareware here, some shareware there. It sums up to quite an investment. On top of that some Apple Pro apps that I would need to replace. I would hurt me somehow to use Lightroom instead of Aperture, but with all that instability I am really, really fed up with OS X and Apple.<br><br>I will sleep over it and make that decision tomorrow, after the re-install of Leopard. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There definitely is a problem between Aperture and Final Cut Studio (the version with Final Cut Pro 5, that is officially supported on Leopard); depending on the installation order, either Aperture or Motion 2 refuse updates. <br><br>In the first installation, I installed Aperture first and then Final Cut Studio. The result was that it was impossible to update Motion 2 to version 2.1.2.<br><br>In my second installation, I installed and updated Final Cut Studio first and then installed Aperture. Guess what: Now Aperture refused the update to 1.5.6. To fix this, I copied an up-to-date version from my notebook (the one that completely works) to the iMac. Now everything works fine, except for the random Safari crash when it is downloading/playing movies. Safari did that even on Tiger, so it's not that big of an issue for me. <br><br>So I now have Vista on the internal 250 GB hard disk of the iMac and Leopard an an external 500 GB firewire disk, and now everything seems to be back to a more or less normal and acceptable state. And that is the good news.<br><br>That bad news is that I had to downgrade the iMac G4 1GHz 1GB RAM of my girl friend back to a fresh Tiger installation. Even after installing Leopard on a freshly formatted hard disk on that machine, its performance just sucked. And to make things worse, the USB iSub subwoofer only payed back garbage instead of music. That machine is now back to Tiger 10.4.11 and runs very well.<br><br>I'm glad that I did not touch the 12" PowerBook G4 1Ghz 768MB RAM... Tiger runs great on it, and I can only imagine what Leopard would have done to it.<br><br>That simply means that Apple's system requirements for Leopard need to be corrected: Don't install it on anything with less than 2 GB RAM and less than a 1.67GHz G4 CPU.<br><br>But here is another good news: Connect 360 for the Mac really works and my Xbox 360 can stream music, pictures AND movies from OS X! :-))) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's the Vista version of OS X... And I find it very scary that Apple's own Pro apps cause such problems on their latest OS. Leopard obviously did not get enough QA testing, or they just ignored everything to be able to push it out of the door. <br><br>Well, Microsoft also got away with Visual Studio 2005 not being compatible with Vista when it was released, so maybe Apple thought "if they get away with that, people won't care if our Pro apps won't run properly before 10.5.x".<br><br>There's also a bunch of other programs that did not run with Leopard, or still don't run. iCalamus works now, but for example you cannot use the software that comes with the new Nikon D300 on Leopard, it's Tiger-only, and Leopard also does not yet support the RAW format of that camera. A friend of mine just bought that beast, and it is a useless piece of expensive equipment with Aperture. Geez, even dcraw on Linux can already handle that RAW format, Lightroom uses dcraw and therefor also is able to process D300 raw images, but Apple does not even find it necessary to post a statement on their website if and when that feature is coming. <br><br>I guess this is the kind of problem and attitude can have to expect once a company removes the word "computer" from its name, but rather sells mp3 player cell phones. And I'm afraid this won't make any of us happy on the long run. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
