For $800 you can get a 1.25GHz eMac (yeah, I know, blech). Why bid $800 on an 800MHz box (second hand?)?<br><br>Performance-wise, I'd say that the G4 compares favorably with a PC running at 1.5x the clockspeed. A dual-G4 compares favorably with a PC running at 2x the clockspeed. (Individual apps may run slower, but the OS uses the spare processor to keep things going.)<br><br>Before you dismiss this as the effects of Steve Jobs's Reality Distortion Field (tm):<br><br>1) I'm currently (well, not at this moment!) playing World of Warcraft on my 2.5y old dual 1GHz G4 with its original Radeon 9000 (64MB I think). It is running faster than it did on my wife's 1.5y old 2.4GHz Dell (with a 128MB FX5200 video card), but slower than on my 2.4GHz Dell with a 256MB FX5600. It only chokes when I fly through Ironforge on a griffin (but so does my wife's Dell).<br><br>2) Photoshop, Firefox, et al launch and run as fast or faster on the Mac than the Dells (and they're not reliant on GPU the way WoW is).<br><br>Incidentally -- BlitzMax runs dandy on my old dual G4, and (given that I don't think it takes advantage of dual processors) should run even better on a new iBook. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Raw calculation power wise, the 1.5 GHz G4 is about 1/3rd as fast as my IBM Thinkpad T42p (1.8 GHz Pentium-M). The look and feel of the GUI however appears about equal, if not a bit smoother on the Mac. And the wide screen on the 17" is awesome, if only they'd used a real HD format (1920 x 1440, or at least 1920 x 1280) it would also in the vertical be really useful.

When that happens with IBM (has happened once before in 8 years of thinkpad ownership), I bring it in to the nearest service people. If the HD still works for a data transfer, they ghost the disk onto the new disk and I'm up and running again in less than a day.<br><br>With Dell, it first took me almost a week to convince them that the harddisk crashes after a few hours of use, after making an ugly noise (they in all sincerity asked me to video record it and play the sound to the support technician!).<br><br>Well, after that, they sent me a new harddisk by way of a technician that wanted to take the old harddisk with right away. A couple hours of available runtime allows for a ghost, so instead of setting up my entire machine again (which takes anywhere between 2-3 days of work), I wanted to ghost to the new harddisk. Not only did the tech not even have the material with him (additional drive bay for instance), he also did a freakout on me regarding me not letting him take the old disk with him. After a long discussion on the phone with the homebase, he said it was ok but I had to ship it back to them within 2 days. <br><br>So I network ghosted the old disk, got the machine back running, and then the display failed.<br><br>Tech comes back (after a long struggle to find a suiting time and day, after they refuse to specify time of arrival any more precise than 5 hours).<br><br>Luckily, in the meantime my IBM Thinkpad had been delivered and I had a machine to work off during that disaster.<br><br>Oh, and the funny thing was: Dell support told me that in fact I was the one who screwed up, not them, because I bought the wrong model. The inspiron is not meant to be in constant use, just occasional home use. Professionals should be the latitude line of laptops. What a crock of sh...!!<br><br>So here you have my story why I will never buy Dell again. There's another one with a Dell Poweredge server I had bought about 4 years ago which has (and always had) system hangs every now and then despite numerous OS reinstalls. But they won't replace the motherboard or memory because I can't proof it's a component fault. This despite extended warranty I had purchased.<br><br>I should also add that the inspiron was by far the cheapest manufactured laptop I had ever seen. titanium thinkpad, or aluminum powerbooks guarantee for a much longer life.<br><br>Argh. While I'm at it the beginning was bad, too: After I ordered from their website, even BEFORE the laptop was delivered, they had the 1.7GHz model out at the same price I paid for the 1.5 GHz model, and I saw that on a flyer they snail mailed to me.

But to be honest...  In the last 4+ years we've had leases with Dell...  We've had to call a tech twice.  Once a motherboard took a crap and once a hard drive took a dump.  That's it.<br><br>I, on the other hand, never cared for the thinkpads...  But laptops are, I think, a very personal preference based item.

We heard support was bad over there, not much we can do from here.". He did try hard however, and it was only through his intervention that the videotaping requirement for the failing HD was waived... <br><br>I agree about the personal taste with the laptop, but there are just certain manufacturing quality issues that you only become aware of when you see (and feel) those computers side by side. The keyboards on the mac and thinkpad are different, but of equal quality for instance. The Dell doesn't even come close. I had a stuck key within a month on the Dell (after lifting off the key cap i saw a piece of plastic that wasn't properly shaped, fixed that with a knife..). When adjusting the monitor angle, both the powerbook and thinkpad are rock solid, the Dell was worn out after a month or two.
