It's better than it was but still a bit odd if your not used to it.<br><br>Most 3D apps today have modeling, materials and scene building all in one. Lightwave originaly split all these things into modules. It's become more integrated since v6 but you still have seperate modules for layout and modeling.<br><br>Lightwave is a good product, I've used it on and off since the Amiga days, however I do prefer maya and max to it by some margin, particularly for game development.<br><br>If this is Mac related and you want a 3D app to use professionaly I'd probably get Maya as it has more industry wide support. Lightwave would come second.<br><br>I'm not sure but I hear that 3dsmax 8 is being written from the ground up, as it's been around the longest and Discreet feels that an overhaul of the core would be a good idea. The rumour is that 3dsmax will then go cross platform, much like Combustion which was for PC only for the longest time.<br><br>I think Joe Hocking uses either Lightwave or Maya on the Mac these days, he might be able to give better advice. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I moved on to another developer in 2002 and used maya and max and never looked back, found they just seem better suited to realtime games. But if your modeling or doing FMV LW is great Just different.<br><br>In my experience a lot more developers are using 3d apps as their level editing tools these days, and being able to model and arange your scenes in a single interface has a lot of benefits. Probably how 3dsmax originaly got ahead in game development. Then maya came along a couple of years later, and more recently XSI. I'd imagine that XSI is the most modern of the 3 apps, but its only just starting to make inroads in game development. <br><br>I saw that the people making Project gotham racing 3 for Xbox are now using XSI and looking for a new artist :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I spend 2h a day commuting in my car, and maybe another 4h running errands, which is something like 14h out of 112h spent awake per week -- or over 10% of my waking life. So it makes sense that I want a car that's comfortable, has good sound, and so forth. I can understand why someone would spend, say, an extra $10,000 to get a car that makes them more comfortable for 10% of the time. Heck, I spent $3000 on a couch that makes me comfortable say 3% of the time.<br><br>I spend 8-12h per day using a computer of some kind. I earn my living by it, and I spend quite a bit of my leisure time using it. And folks say that I should buy a computer that costs $1000 less and suffer from all kinds of daily inconveniences and productivity loss (e.g. if you're doing graphic work, the OS provides a stable underlying color model used by most apps). What's more, every TCO study shows that a Mac is cheaper to own than a PC (how much do you value the time you spend tinkering with your PC?). If you pay $10,000 more for a car, you generally pay proportionately more for service, and quite possible fuel. (That sexy BMW costs a lot more to service than a Taurus, and uses a lot more gas than a Honda.)<br><br>Don't ask whether you'd buy a Mac Mini for yourself, because chances are you wouldn't use one as your main PC. Ask what you'd recommend to some computer-illiterate friend or parent given that you'll be providing tech support down the line. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

One of the many benefits is never having to reboot(or at least VERY rarely). Only real reason to stick with windoze is because they are usually the first to get hardware drivers. Other than that Windows is just bloatware and second rate. I've got mini-itx (see mini-itx.com) setups running linux -good but not always pretty. mini-itx is fun for the geek in all of us. Now with the advent of Mini Macs you have the chance to get the best of all worlds. Unix stability, user friendly GUI, great looks, pre-built Small Form Factor, enough power for most tasks, and you can kid the wife that it really didn't cost that much. Buy one now, and if you don't like it put it on ebay, you'll probably double your money;-) I would opt for the upgrade to 512 though.<br>Don't worry about software for Macs either - its all available(especially now that Blitz is here).
