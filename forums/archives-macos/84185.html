Make a triple boot using Bootcamp, or install a virtual machine like VMWare, Parallels or VirtualBox and install Linux and Vista there.<br><br>Of course, I realize that Bootcamp may most likely produce the best results (as there's no emulator/virtualizer or whatchamacallit involved), but as I plan to use it as little as possible and hating to have to restart the Mac and wanting to be able to do things in MacOS while running a Windows App at the same time (as I did often with two computers now until my Windows Machine got broken) it may make a Virtualizer better.<br><br>Does a virtualizer make too much difference or is it as reliable as a clean boot? (Or at least reliable enough if it's most of all to compile stuff and a quick test, that is possibly a little slower).<br><br>(Oh, specs for my new Mac: <a href="http://store.apple.com/nl/browse/home/shop_mac/family/imac" target="_blank">http://store.apple.com/nl/browse/home/shop_mac/family/imac</a> Second Mac from the left. I hope you can understand it even though the page is in Dutch. Apple refused to give me the English version of the page).<br><br>And when it comes to a Virtual Machine.<br>VirtualBox is free, the others are quite expensive. Is VirtualBox good enough for the job I intend for it or should I really put my money on VMWare or Parallels (of course, since VirtualBox is free I can try it first, but since installing Windows and Linux is a pretty time consuming job, I'd like to do it right in once). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Non graphics stuff works very well. Compiling is quick (compared to my P4 work PC, it's easily 3x as fast).<br>Obviously, OGL/DX graphics stuff could be better.<br>However, since my graphics card is Intel... it's not surprising. On an ATI/NVidia, I'd expect it to work much better.<br>I've also been running win98 on VMWare recently, and it boots in about 7 seconds :-p<br>Same issues with the slower graphics.<br><br>I don't have bootcamp, but as you'd expect, Windows will run at native speeds, since there's no VM to get in the way.<br><br>I suppose it depends what you need, at the end of the day.<br>Since I'm only doing minimal dev work on Windows - and none of that involves much in the way of graphics - I'm happy enough with both Parallels and VMWare. They certainly "feel" almost native, when working in non-graphics stuff.<br>Just make sure you have plenty of RAM to give everything.<br><br>The other advantage of running in VM, is of course the fact that you can be working on Mac at the same time. Copy/Paste code between Mac and Windows IDE is pretty handy sometimes. (I was doing this yesterday).<br>Parallels even has a mode in which the Windows desktop disappears and applications appear as normals windows on the Mac desktop.<br><br>I don't have any experience of Virtual Box on Mac...  tried it out on Windows once. It worked - which is all I can say of it.<br><br>As for Linux, I've used it on Parallels and VMWare, and it works fine.<br>However, at the moment, I actually run it on its own PC (a Quad-core with 4gig RAM), but... I use it on the Mac via an NXClient (NOMACHINE), which in essence is just like sitting at the other PC.<br>The advantage of course, is I don't have to lift my arse off the chair, or move to a different keyboard/mouse - I'm a lazy sod, I suppose :-)<br><br>The main thing... get lots of RAM... if you want to use a VM.... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Since it's not an emulater or virtual environment, you have to rely on all the "fake" windows libraries to do what they are meant to. (like, for instance, keyboard/mouse/joystick/audio support). Graphics rendering seems to be at (as far as I can see) almost native speed.<br><br>Thumbs up from here :-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
