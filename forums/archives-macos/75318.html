I'm sure we all know blitzmax relies somehow on xcode, I can't claim to know personally how though. Xcode is also where the SDK is located, so there's a connection. Steve Jobs told everyone in clear, uncryptic words that the iphone and itouch run native mac os X, so it seems at least on the surface to someone like me that it should be simple... mouse events are tap events, etc.. and you would need to add the motion sensor stuff, but that should be simple. Anyone with deep technical knowledge got anything to say? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

OS X executables (PPC or i86) can't simply be copied to it from a Mac and run, as is. They'd need to be recompiled for the ARM, for a start (which BlitzMax doesn't support). Also, the source code would likely need some host-specific changes for the iPhone OS. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Not sure if a simple one-for-one text substituter would do the trick - i.e. without having to write a full parser. Of course, the deluxe solution would probably be to implement a BlitzMax front end for gcc.<br><br>There's also a small amount of asm in the module libraries which would need to be ported to the ARM. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If someone could just do that, we could put bmx-made apps on the iphone and itouch without worrying about ARM and whatever other problems. Personally, I think blitzmax research would be stupid not to get bmx working on the iphone and itouch... they're already such hot products, and with the SDK, which you can tell from the vid on apple's website is simply amazing, bmx would profit a TON. You may or may not have heard about spore, but it's probably the most anticipated, most advanced, most breakthrough game ever, and they're gonna release it on the iphone and itouch! I dream of being able to program for the i's :D <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
