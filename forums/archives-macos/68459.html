There's a reason why it's so cheap. It's practically obsolete.<br><br>I have an iBook which is a 300Mhz G3 with almost the same graphics card. BlitzMax is not fast enough for any really useful purpose on that machine. The main issue is doing graphics. The OpenGL output really does need hardware acceleration. I severely doubt that the card it comes with (or any that that machine supports) has enough graphics ram for you to use hardware acceleration, and I severely doubt that the OpenGL driver is anything other than a software driver. That means the CPU does all the graphics rendering and computation. You can basically read that to mean it is going to be very slow for any graphics you want to do, certainly you won't be able to do anything at more than a few frames per second, even for the really simply stuff.<br><br>I do use it for BlitzMax development when I don't have access to our faster 1GHz G4 which has an NVidea GeForce4 graphics card with hardware-accelerated OpenGL (which is like 100 times faster than in some operations than the G3 machine). I can use it to write code in the IDE and compile it and test stuff but I don't expect it to run at any kind of interactive speed. It also takes quite a bit longer to compile. I would probably try to aim for *at least* a 700 or so MHz G4 CPU, and a much better graphics card - say .7 to 1 billion texels/second is pretty reasonable like a GeForce 2/3/4 or better. Make sure the graphics card has at least 16 megs video ram, preferably 32 or 64, otherwise the os will not support hardware accelerated OpenGL and may not even support full-screen OpenGL displays (ie windowed only). On my G3 I cannot do any OpenGL graphics in full-screen, the driver does not support it and there is not enough video ram for the buffers.<br><br>Go with a G4 and much better graphics card and you'll be set for a pretty comfortable development/test/play paltform. Those Mac Mini's I think have like a 1GHz G4 with a good mid-range graphics card, that would be much more suitable for decent BlitzMax performance. Not that Max is slow, but the graphics does need some ooph. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The processor is very much going to affect compile speeds etc etc. but the older macs (iMac g3s for example) have virtualy no graphics acceleration. as in sometimes using hardware rendering is slower (even on a system that slow) than using software rendering...<br><br>Compiling doesn't have to happen in real time though, that can take forever as long as your patient... so is it just for compiling (in which case it's a $100 compiling system and as long as you get blitz running you're fine, I'd say wipe the HD and start clean) or do you plan to do anything (any testing etc) with it... in which case you need something newer.<br><br>I haven't done extensive testing between intel and PPC macs with blitz but with all my debuging in various languages I think you're not going to notice any differences so you can just mac debug on the mini then PPC compile on the iMac. Unless you write some intel specific stuff obviously. I think you'll notice Mac vs. PC problems and never really notice a PPC vs Intel problem.<br><br>Just my 2bits <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
