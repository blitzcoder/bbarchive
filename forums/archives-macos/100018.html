I would have done it more simply myself, but it isn't as insane in the end as it seems in the beginning (it does seem stupid complicated when you start)<br>* I'm sure there are a number of both IAP mangers on git hub as well as IAP implementation guides for mac if you google enough. I found that by skimming an IAP guide for iOS I got the basics in place, then it was just tacking little bits on until it worked right. Took me about a day to go from looking at apple's "documentation" (really just an outline of the concepts) to functioning implementation by just poking at a guide. Annoying, but not amazingly hard. It's all either it works or it doesn't type stuff.<br>* If you implement IAP outside of Apple's I would expect they wouldn't approve it for the store. I'm not positive on Mac, but I know that's 100% not allowed on iOS and the rules are similar (though the Mac store is a bit more permissive due to the expanded nature of the platform over mobile). So while that might save you a lot of development time in theory, you will lose a huge chunk of mac market potential. You can always strip that out for a mac store only build, and if you're going multiplatform it would probably be a good idea to have that easily blocked out anyway. For optimal reach you could implement a 3rd party IAP manager for other platforms and mac sales *not* through the app store, then implement the app store IAP for that specific build, a lot of companies do this sort of thing (see Steam version of games vs. Mac App Store version) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
