To enter, simply request a free contest version of Unity Pro, the Mac-based cutting-edge game development tool, or use any 3D development tool to enter!<br><br>“iDevGames' mission since its founding has been to educate and motivate Mac game developers, as well as to attract new developers to the Mac platform. Entrants in our previous game development contests, uDevGames and OMG, have produced amazing games and can now be found working on AAA titles around the world. The 3DU Contest will challenge our community of indie developers to create unique 3D games, as well as taking advantage of a professional-level tool", said Carlos Camacho, Editor-in-Chief of iDevGames.<br><br>The 3DU Contest is sponsored by Over The Edge Entertainment (OTEE), makers of Unity (http://unity3d.com). Unity is the only Mac-based high-end game development tool sporting a stylish pro-app GUI, no-friction workflow and over-the-top technical features such as extensible shaders and full-screen effects, great particles, a highly optimized scripting engine supporting C#, JavaScript and a dialect of Python, the Ageia physX Engine, skinned character animation and ragdolls. Unity is being used by game developers such as Codemasters and Freeverse, in game design education, and amongst creative visualization professionals.<br><br>"We feel strongly about providing the best tools for Mac game development to both the professional and indie game developers. The iDevGames community has a strong track record of producing both cool Mac games, and Mac game developers, so we're excited to partner with them on the 3DU Contest", says David Helgason, CEO of OTEE.<br><br>The first place winner will receive Unity Pro ($1499 value). The second place winner will be given Unity Indie ($249 value) or receive a 33% discount on Unity Pro ($500 value). The third place winner will be given Unity Indie ($249 value), with all three winners also given an ATI Mac Radeon X1900 XTl ($399 value). All qualifying entrants receive a nine month Unity Indie license -- a great way to jump-start the development of their next game.<br><br>To enter, simply apply at <a href="http://www.idevgames.com/forum/showthread.php?p=122624" target="_blank">http://www.idevgames.com/forum/showthread.php?p=122624</a> before December 18 (11:59 PM GMT).
