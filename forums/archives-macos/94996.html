You can't edit in it. you can't even open from it for reading. That is the OS preventing exactly what happened to you D4NM4N... so then how did it happen? The trash is in reality a hidden folder (~/.Trash) and as such can be accessed unix level things (read things that ARN'T mac native... i.e. you're sort of mixing OS levels... such as say a command line git client that was designed exclusively for unix/linux and doesn't know what .Trash is...) directly, thus bypassing all the mac OS level protections on it. Couple that with the file ident system that keeps track of moving files when they are access through their ident rather than their path...<br><br>I have never heard of this happening before because you need a perfect storm of errors:<br>1) Use a file in a program (presumably a GUI git client...) that uses idents rather than paths to target files... (p.s. I use Tower, which is the gold standard on mac for Git GUI, and it does NOT use idents...)<br>2) Throw away that file but DON'T empty the trash, so the ident is still valid though the file should technically be un reachable<br>3) Using the ident program, that incidentally doesn't check to see if the ident'd file is still accessable, to trigger a command line function to access the raw path of the file (in this case the Git GUI is calling the Git command line tools with a decoded path from the ident of the file, which is in the trash, and as such has not been edited because what you're using to edit isn't going to go into the trash, it's not allowed.)<br><br>Soooo, the Git GUI is ultimately to blame because it's playing by 2 sets of rules (path and ident) and not doing sanity checking on either one before sending the results out to the command line. I can see how one would blame the OS for this, but really it's a bad program, in the same way that say on windows a program that uses a system DLL and then crashes while accessing it. You don't blame the DLL (unless it's corrupted... thanks windows), it's the program's fault for not addressing things properly.<br><br>On a personal side note: I freaking hate Eclipse. I have never seen a full scale Java program that wasn't RIDDLED with problems on all operating systems. Making a development environment like that is just madness... I love cross platform but Java is just inherently buggy in different ways on all OS's and therefore makes for a rats nets of issues. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Although that's not just OS X - Windows also has similar issues.<br><br>I've run into both of the issues below myself, which were extremely frustrating to deal with because the OS is actively preventing you from fixing it.<br><br>For example, there are scenarios where you can end up with a file or folder named COM1 or LPT2 or CON or something on Windows... Except the OS won't let you actually remove it. right-click -&gt; delete gives an error. attempting to move it gives an error.<br>Some malware uses that trick to prevent the OS or other programs from removing it. I've also seen it on a compromised IIS webserver, where some people managed to connect by FTP, create a folder by those names, and then uploaded a bunch of pirated stuff into it. Good luck for the webmaster, because even if they spot the folder with malicious things, the OS won't even let you enter the folder to see what's inside, let alone allow you to remove it.<br><br>The only way I found to get rid of them is to open a command prompt in that folder, do a DIR /X to see the 'short' name of the file, and manually remove it from there.<br><br>Another windows problem is if you end up with a recursive folder copy, and you end up with subfolders thousands of levels deep... Except the OS won't let you delete any path longer than 256 characters or so, and won't remove any folders that aren't empty yet.<br>Only way I found that can actually fix this properly, was to use robocopy to mirror an empty folder into the recursive one, which removes the 'unremovable' contents as well.<br>The MS knowledge base 'solution' to this problem only listed a workaround kludge where you use SUBST to assign a new driveletter to the last folder you can access properly, and then continue on this alternate drive. Which only works for so many subfolders until you max that one out, and you can SUBST again, until you max that one out, etc. If you run out of driveletters before you reach the deepest folder their solution was to reformat the drive and start over....
