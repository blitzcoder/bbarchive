And there's probably even more Linux users <br>than Mac users.  The majority are Windows users.<br><br>Then, if you do move the Mac OS X section up, the Linux users are going to <br>want their section moved up, and of course the Windows users are not going <br>to take that lightly and feel that it's an insult if their section is not up there <br>also.

Just finding the same reply posted in several threads would have <br>caused me to react the same way.  I should probably learn to not let such <br>little things get to me though.  My reaction is probably not justifiable.<br><br>You should have just started a new post in the other forums that was titled <br>with your intent so that there would be no confusion or OT situations within <br>an established thread.<br><br>IMO, regardless of what you do to attempt to get your idea to the powers that <br>be, it won't get the section moved.<br><br>But hey, gotta give you credit for at least taking some sort of action on <br>something you think is needed, maybe not the best way to go about bringing <br>attention to your cause, but at least you did something.<br><br>-Garrett <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
