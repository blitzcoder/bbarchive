It has some limitations such as no full-screen OpenGL support and the likes, and the software OpenGL emulation is very slow, but you can compile &amp; build programs with it.<br><br>A few months ago when the first Intel-based development Mac's were sent out, it didn't take long for people to copy the OS and to have it running on a 'normal' PC either using VMWare, or even natively on some Dell's. However, Apple has since apparently added a bunch of other protections to prevent that from happening, at least not as easily. The OSX for intel Mac's apparently does run (as expected) at native speeds on these normal PC's. No official Apple builds though -- keep in mind that Apple is primarily a hardware company, that has always used a fairly closed platform, for which they are the only provider (aside from a very short stint where they licensed the Mac hardware stuff to some 3rd party developers).<br><br>Historically, they haven't been pushing a Mac as a means to run OS-X, but OS-X as a means to use your Mac. It is unlikely that they are going to be selling OS-X for 'normal' PC's anytime soon -- so far they've always made a lot more money on the premiums for the mac hardware than they would make on just selling the software for people to run on a different brand PC.<br>Supposedly they have kept a parallel Intel-based version of OS-X under wraps for many years now, so had they wanted to they could have released a PC version a long time ago -- yet they haven't.<br><br>another big benefit that Apple has over, say, Microsoft, is that since the Apple is afairly closed system, they have almost full control over all the hardware components their users can have. Part of Windows' problem is that there are a bazillion different possible hardware configurations, not all of which work reliably. OS-X has to work with a lot less variables than windows does, and benifits stability-wise from that aspect.<br><br>Personally I doubt that Apple will release a version of their OS for generic PC's any time soon, but there are bound to be 3rd party 'emulators' that will be able to run it on a generic PC with little to no speed loss. Since the CPU architecture is would be identical for an intel Mac, you don't have the massive slowdownthat the current emulators have, which need to virtualize an entire PowerPC CPU that has significantly more registers at its disposal than the emulating PC hardware does. 'emulating' an identical CPU is a lot more efficient. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Microsoft could squeeze them like bugs. Maybe in a few years from now when Apple holds a bigger market share they will do it. Or when Steve Jobs no longer is the CEO and somebody else with a different attitude takes over. But maybe none of this will ever happen.<br><br>My advice for the moment simply would be to simply buy an Intel Mac instead of a PC the next time you want to get a new machine... :-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
