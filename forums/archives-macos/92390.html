Developers will have to release something halfway decent and relatively bug-free.<br>3.  This will increase the overall quality of software being targeted to Mac users by getting rid of the garbage and forcing developers to adhere to standards that they should have been adhering to all along.<br>4.  It provides a way for indie developers to be more competitive with the major commercial programs that are sold for Macs.<br><br>For developers who have always been releasing quality products, they should have no problem with changes and should welcome the increased exposure they will be getting by selling through the new App Store.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2010</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It cannot say that it would surprise me.<br><br>Even though Steve Jobs lied a couple of months ago when he was asked whether there would be an App Store for the Mac (he flatly said "no"), after the success of the AppStore for iPhone/iPod/iPad it was always quite clear that they sooner or later would also implement the same concept for the Mac (as long as the Mac is still around).<br><br>Now he says that the forthcoming Mac AppStore for Snow Leopard is "optional", but of course "the best way" to buy, download and install software for OS X. With Lion -- the OS X version that for the first time will incorporate iOS features -- the Mac AppStore will become a part of the default OS installation, but it will still be "optional" to use. But does anybody really believe that the Mac will stay an "open" platform? In 10.8, which will be even more like iOS, thanks to "its huge success" and because "Apple is all about the best user experience", I bet that it will be the only sanctioned way to deploy third party software on OS X.<br><br>Prepare for jailbreaking your Macs in the year 2013.

Good for Apple certainly -- revenue stream plus marketing to sell more iDevices.  Good for customers, I suppose, everything you buy is on credit -- no cash required.  But good for developers who seek compensation for there efforts?<br><br>In June, Apple boasted that a billion dollars (US) had been paid to developers.  At the time there were about 200K apps.  That's $5K per app.  Now it was pointed out that some of those apps were meant to be free (perhaps 30%).  But some apps had been on the market for 3 years by then!

They DO control the app store, so concievably they could mandate that apps be developed for mac using Xcode (like they require for iOS because again, they control the store there as well). However unlike iOS, the platform allows code execution without requiring signed distribution. They could in theory change this as well at some point but, like iOS, this doesn't make it illegal, only very difficult to run unsigned code. On iOS jailbreaking is legal, and more importantly jail break requiring apps are TOTALLY legal... it's just beyond the average user to install them. Even if jailbreaking were illegal the apps themselves would be legal there would just be no legal means of installing them... for reference look up XBMC. It started as a media center app for moded xbox consoles. You couldn't install it without a mod (illegal in some places, legal in others) and more crucially the binaries required an xbox development license to compile.... since MS would never give out such a license to freeware developers it was illegal to distribute binaries, BUT the source was totally legal (just un-usable without illegal things like a stolen toolkit...). The project based on that source has since morphed into a great cross platform media center and has dropped xbox as an officially supported platform from it's source entirely at this point...<br><br>Source is the property of the person that writes it (or the organization/person that buys it)<br>Binaries require source and tools to create, both have to be legal for the binaries to be legal (e.g. XBMC for xbox = illegal binaries, jailbreak iOS apps = legal as the source and the toolkits are both publicly available)<br>Using binaries requires access to the system that may require circumventing security measures (jailbreaking on iOS, modding on a console, etc.) that may or may not be legal depending on any number of factors (desktop OS's are un-restricted typically, though may have security layers in place that may or may not restrict the execution of code, on all desktop and known desktop platforms in the future there are ways to circumvent the security out of the box to run any code without modifying the system)<br><br>Legality != end user accessible. they are distinct concepts. Further, no desktop OS currently, or known plans in the future attempts to permanently restrict code execution in such a way that requires system modification to circumvent (unlike so called "closed" platforms, such as iOS). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
