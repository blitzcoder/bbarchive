Now a lot of people would now turn around and say I don't have the l33t skills and I'm a n00b for doing so, but quite frankly I see a computer as a tool to be used not a lifestyle choice. So I went out and bought a Mac. And to cut a long story short, my mac mini has been the best tool I've ever bought.<br><br>I shall make two analogies that I think best describe the difference between a Mac and A PC. The first is the British Car industry. Before the Japanese imports arrived in the UK, a car was expected to break down and you were expected to know how to fix it. Every car owner in Britain had to be an amateur mechanic, constantly fixing and tuning there oily bags of bolts that is, as a tool, just meant to get you from A to B. But Japanese cars did not break down. They didn't need constant maintenance. They would start even when it was cold. They, excuse the expression, just worked. They created the better tool for moving you from A to B and that is why Japan has a car industry and why the UK does not.<br><br>The second analogy is Western and Eastern electronic goods. Western electronics tend to have one big button marked "on" which switches the device to factory settings and starts doing its job well. Eastern electrical goods tend to have a wall of dials and switches which allow you access to every setting, and if you play around with them for long enough, you may get the device to do the job a bit better than the western device.<br><br>My computing experience with a PC and Mac has been like night and day. Sure, if you have enough time to fiddle around with a PC, yes it can do more than a Mac, but I don't. As an out the box working, low maintenance, tool; the Mac is in a league of its own. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

After 20 years with Microsoft software and PCs, I needed something new and bought the first Mac Mini when it came out last year.<br><br>Since then I am hooked and moved completely to OS X and Macs. I currently own four Macs and no PC anymore, but well, I know that I am nuts. ;-)<br><br>The reasons behind my fascination are very simple: The Mac -really- just works. It has a UNIX foundation with everything a hacker, geek or whatever you want to name it loves. All the things people love about Linux is also inside a Mac thanks to its Mach kernel and FreeBSD userland. On top of it is a beautifully designed GUI and you will not find a Mac application that is not perfectly well integrated. (Unless, of course, it comes from Microsoft.)<br><br>If you are a technical person that only judges a product by its functionality, then this argument does not count for you, but it does count for me: Software for Mac OS X just looks well designed and beautiful. It is a piece of art, while Windows and its mostly ugly applications look like a cheap newspaper with lots of "loud" ads and headlines. The Mac spoiled me, and using Windows now really annoys me because of its thorough ugliness. If there was no Mac anymore, I'd rather use Gnome than Windows these days. It does not look as nice as the Mac, but at least it does not look cheap and ugly.<br><br>And all of the Mac applications know what drag&amp;drop is all about (except for the Microsoft products) and heavily use it. This really is an important difference to Windows, where you right click all the time: On the Mac, drag &amp; drop is the way to do things. And since we are talking about objects on a desktop metaphor, this is more natural. <br><br>But in the first two weeks there is a chance that you will become frustrated with a Mac: Everything is easier than it is on Windows, and you just need some time to think straightforward and simple again -- which is something you never do when you use Windows. In Windows, you always have to go around a corner and take a detour to get something done. In a Mac, you -ALWAYS- go the straight and obvious way. Only that Windows users forget what the obvious way is, and that is why the transition to the Mac takes a while. <br><br>But after two weeks, you do not -want- to use Windows anymore. You'd radther go with Linux/FreeBSD and Gnome/KDE instead than going back to Windows.<br><br>But on the Mac it is not just the software itself that looks good and "just works". Also the hardware and the many, many beautiful little details that went into it are amazing. <br><br>I have this Intel iMac Core Duo, and it does not produce noise and it consumes only 65 Watts per hour. And Half Life 2 runs absolutely smoothly at 1680*1050 pixels with all details turned on. And no fan jumps in. I have a real problem with noise, so I can only find that extremely cool. If there was no other reason to buy a Mac - this would already be reason enough for me. I do not know of any PC that can claim that it is noiseless. But the Mac is.<br><br>A few months ago, a colleague of mine managed to pull my old PowerBook off the table because the power cable was somehow tied around his chair. This is something that probably many people have experienced before, and Apple now is the first (and still only) notebook manufacturer that has learned its lesson and developed what the call "Magsafe". They now have magnetical power plugs on their new notebooks, and when somebody pulls the power cable, it justs goes off without pulling the notebook with it. After the experience with my old notebook, this is just a killer argument for buying a MacBook (Pro).<br><br>If you do not want to invest too much money, start with the Intel Mac Mini with a Core Duo CPU with at least 1 GB of RAM, better 2. Unlike Windows, Mac OS X really takes advantage of much memory, and if you have PowerPC only applications that need to run in Rosetta, you want the additional memory to speed up the emulator. <br><br>What you also need will be Bootcamp to dual boot into windows (www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp) and you might also want to get yourself a copy of Parallels Desktop for Mac OS X (www.parallels.com), which is a very nice "VMWare" for the Mac. With Parallels, you can Windows in a window on the Intel Macs. Really cool and useful.<br><br>Since you are a "switcher", I would not recommend buying a used PowerPC Mac. I am sure you will still want to have Windows available, just in case. Althoguh you won't be using it except for playing computer games. ;-)<br><br>As for BlitzMax: It looks the nicest on Mac OS X and to be honest, I do not know how it really behaves on Linux or Windows. I have installed it on all three platforms and made sure that all the sample programs compiled and ran, but I actually only use BlitzMax on OS X on PowerPC and Intel Macs. And there it is just nice. :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Each of them has its own strengths and weaknesses. I´m only saying that once you start using the Mac, you will not --want-- to use Windows anymore unless you have a good reason for it, like requiring a certain application that only exists for Windows. <br><br>But don´t get me wrong.

The MacBook's 64MB graphics memory is actually shared with the 512MB main memory (unlike the Pro, which has separate video memory) plus some overhead. So you'd really need to upgrade to the maximum 2GB to offset that to get acceptable 3D performance. <br><br>Also, if you're going to install multiple OSes, you're going to need a larger hard disk (say 100-120GB) to accommodate all that bloatware. <br>Having done that as well, now the price is not much less than that of the entry-level MacBook Pro anyway. <br><br>Yeah, the word on the street seems to be that the MacBook's integrated graphics can handle all but the latest high-end 3D games for now (provided you install additional memory) but like you say, it's hardly future-proofed. And it's probably the bare minimum spec for Vista.<br><br>The other major con with the MacBook is probably the glossy screen and the  problems you get with reflections. Whereas with the Pro, you have the option of getting the usual matt, anti-glare display instead. The other features I really like about the Pro are the illuminated keyboard and the ExpressCard socket.<br><br>It turns out that if you take a bare-bones, white MacBook and soup it up so it's equivalent to the black MacBook, it works out $150 cheaper - and the only difference is the colour. Apparently Apple hiked the price of the black MacBook when they realised that (like the black iPods) they were selling like hotcakes.<br><br>So, I'm definitely starting to lean that way now. Even though I do really like the smaller, lighter, longer battery-life, sexy, black MacBook - as painful as it is to my wallet, I think I'm gonna buy the 15" MacBook Pro instead. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

And, when you look at the prices of Mac Pros and comparable Dell Precision workstations, then I think it is Dell who has to learn some lessons these days.<br><br>By the way, when you compare the MacBook with the MacBook Pro you are actually comparing oranges with apples, and you simply cannot do that. The only MacBook getting anywhere close to the smallest MacBook Pro would be the black MacBook with all extras, and then you see very soon that the price difference is only a few hundred dollars, and not the 50% you are talking about. And for the higher price, you get a bigger screen, 3D ATI graphics and a notebook case that is -not- made of plastic. All of that easily justifies the extra costs.<br><br>One should also keep in mind that the target audience for the MacBooks is different from the one for the MacBook Pros. Most of the MacBook customers probably never find out that their notebooks do not have an outstanding 3D performance. They don't play with them. They don't write games. They don't use Maya. When you're into these things, you buy the professional machines, not the low-end consumer stuff. <br><br>To put it all very simple: The MacBooks have a competetive value for their price, like all other current Apple machines. But nevertheless, we can still here the same Apple-is-expensive-whining as we did in the years before their switch to Intel. Only this time, the whining is entirely unjustified. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
