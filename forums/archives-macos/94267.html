In the real world there's not much difference but to some it's all the difference in the world :0) Basically linux is very much LIKE UNIX (like windows 7 is LIKE windows XP, totally different guts that do almost the same thing in almost the same way), where as OS X is more akin to a unix distribution, see the Darwin for more info on the Unixy under pinnings of OS X.<br><br>I think of OS X as actually a bespoke OS running on top of a UNIX system. As such with a mac running OS X you can run Unix (and by extension most linux) software, X11, OS X, Mac OS 9 and under all natively in one space. Add on virtualization software line Parallels, or unix/linuxy compatibility layers like Wine and you can run windows software in the same space. And should you hit a compatibility issue there then reboot to running windows natively via BootCamp...<br><br>When you close a window on a mac you're closing a window. Some programs elect to close themselves when there are no more windows open (such as iPhoto and other single interface applications) but by OS standards a window and the application are independent (which is why the menu bar is not attached to the window, you can use the menus to do other things, like open a NEW window after closing all the existing windows...). Programs that have a dot under them in the dock are currently running wether you see any windows or not. It's often confusing for people coming from windows where if you don't see it then it doesn't exist for all intents, but it allows for a much more dynamic OS experience, such as your mail program can run in the background checking mail without having to take up any screen space (or be custom coded to support minimizing to the tray etc...). It also is in keeping with Mac's multitasking philosophy of multiple things being not just run but USED at once. This is why mac windows don't typically maximize to cover the WHOLE screen blocking you from doing anything else, they will generally leave space so you can work with things behind other things. Your screen size will often determine if this is a good or bad idea (lots of windows on a small screen turn into a mess pretty quickly, however on large or multiple screens you can effectively run multiple programs with multiple open windows at once without having to "switch" like you generally do on windows since everything wants to be full screen...).<br><br>There is no standard install/remove. Generally speaking an application on mac is supposed to contain all it's resources etc. within the application file itself (which is actually a folder disguised as an executable...) so that it's easy to move, store, sort, etc. without breaking anything. This doesn't always happen, usually because the software is related to a PC variant where that's not possible so to simplify they keep the same structure so there's a parent folde (*cough* adobe). Programs that do that kind of thing or stash stuff in other places (usually somewhere under the /library folder) generally come with an uninstaller script that removes the stuff they bury around your computer. But since there's no registry it's all just files, so even if it leaves something behind without a program to access that something it just sits there passively. It's much more WYSIWYG than windows. if it's deleted it's gone, no dll's and registry entries scattered everywhere. As a result over time it doesn't build up crud that needs to be cleaned out or else it has an effect. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Unified and tightly wrapped makes mac very easy to support, driver support for the most part is totally transparent, you can rely on the hardware to be within specific ranges etc. The advantage to the mongrel that is Linux is that since it's all loose ends is significantly easier to dive deeper, make your own drivers, etc. The new high end distros like Ubuntu mask a lot of the rough edges and do a great job of making it feel like a cohesive system (back when I spent a lot of time on linux I spent more time booted to a terminal than to X11, that's VERY reversed now), but it's still pretty rocky under the surface. In this tortured analogy I'd equate windows to a gelatinous blob, it keeps expanding but there's no cohesive structure holding it together. Sometimes it's smooth, sometimes it's bumpy and you won't know which until you dip your hand in (installing printer A might be plug and play, printer B might take 4 hours of tracking down drivers and then adjusting their internal configuration).<br><br>There's no best OS, just the best for what you're doing based on your comfort level and usage habits (though I'm obviously quite partial to Macs). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I shove mine on the right side of the screen, which with 3 screens means way the hell out of my way unless I turn my head :0) Tweaking the scale of the dock helps a lot as well.<br><br>There are also plenty of hacks and apps you can use to run things differently but I try to stay within the realm of standard so that I know roughly what normal users will be exposed to.<br><br>Mac OS really behaves better and becomes more powerful the more screen space you have, since it encourages you to run lots of things at once anyway. Windows tends to be a bit easier to manage on smaller screens because it tries to limit your focus to 1 or maybe 2 things at a time generally. More screens on windows doesn't tend to help as much simply because it really only wants you running 1 thing at a time anyway, it works but it's not the same level of gain. Conversely a tiny screen is easier since it's not trying to throw as many windows at you at once. I find linux to be a wild card, since the whole UI is totally 100% flexible depending on distro etc. etc. I find it totally unwieldy until I've spent a long time tweaking it just so then it's flawless... until I change something and now I have to re-customize it again... which is why I still prefer the command line (old habits...) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The command line is basically the same (the default shell in OS X is Bash, but you can change it to whatever you like, shell scripts work as you'd expect etc. etc.). I think what you're looking for however is a way to launch Mac OS X applications (that is GUI applications) rather than terminal apps via the command line. The "open" command allows you to do that, it's basically the same thing as double clicking something in the finder (documents will open with their targeted application, applications will open their bin, etc.).<br><br>Mac Applications are actually folders (with a .app extension and a specific content structure containing the binary and various other resources). You can launch the binary directly from the command line, OR use the open command (which has the effect of opening the application, thus telling the OS to find and launch the binary for you rather than locking the terminal...). A couple examples:<br><br>open /Applications/Calculator.app<br>will tell the OS to open the calculator<br><br>/Applications/Calculator.app/Contents/MacOS/Calculator<br>will launch the binary executable for the calculator directly<br><br>cd /Applications/Calculator.app/Contents/MacOS<br>./Calculator<br>That will cd into the calculator app's contents (remember it's just a folder) and into the MacOS folder (which holds the MacOS bin) then launch the calculator<br><br><br>Apple set this structure up (roughly) for the following reasons.<br>Visual programs almost always need assets of some kind. Since everything is in a folder structure you can move the program anywhere you like with ease and without the risk of breaking it by loosing some data file it may need.<br>Other OS's are free to incorporate the same structure (may have been borrowed from next, I don't recall exactly) with their own binary locations. So in theory one application could run on mac natively on PPC or Intel hardware, have native 32 and 64 bit versions for both, AND have windows, linux, Android, iPhone, etc. versions of the same program and all be contained in one "application". To my knowledge only Apple actually uses this structure, but they do use it for iPhone as well, so it is technically possible to have an iPhone and Mac executable in the same "application", however due to the iPhone distribution methods this is probably never actually done (you could do it with a corporate license rather than an app store license, or for distribution to your signed testers, but those are both beyond niche for a feature that is more geared to mass distribution...).<br>And for better or worse it allows easy editing or altering of the associated resources, such as the Info.plist file (which declares version information, application icons, other app info and general data). The con is it's pretty easy to go in and futz with stuff (like screwing with an application's version number), on the positive side it makes it easy to go in an FIX stuff (like file associations for blitzmax IDE which is a little messed, or to give bmx files a custom icon...). It's also great for updaters, they can distribute just the files that changes (probably just the binary, but perhaps some data files too, etc.) so you don't need a complicated updater program that can mesh the changes directly, just swap the files you need and ONLY the files you need, yet the whole program is still just 1 cohesive entity rather than a sprawling folder structure to the user.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I never actually go into the application folder in the finder (except to organize things...

I think my favorite feature is the .app system, great idea, it kind of eliminates the windows registry, "application settings" and on the linux end "/usr/share" and "/etc" in one smooth move.<br>-although the only downside of this of this is you cannot just run from the terminal without lots of extra pathing, basically i miss the  "/usr/bin" system.<br><br>cons for me so far though is that many apps do not seem to have a standardised file browser window,  the whole dock thing sucks for my particular usage methods (Yep i am a mighty instancer!) and the keyboard is taking some furious getting used to.

I see the value for some users, like people just starting out who aren't used to running multiple programs at once (who, are also not likely to be comfortable with the new UI's or possibly not be able to even find them unless someone teaches them...) but for power users it all looks like a step backwards. I know I'm planning on tuning all of the new features to behave just like they do now since seeing less at once reduces my productivity and I don't want my window previews grouped together for the same reasons. The stacking of window previews etc. sounds great if you're coming from say window 7, where you have to hover over the application icon, then hover over the windows, but with my comfort with expose and spaces it just means more clicks and more hovering to get the same thing done slower...<br><br>Not pleased about the recent announcement that FTP is being removed from the sharing panel either (not the system mind you, just can't toggle it with 1 GUI click in lion). Yea FTP is dated and has some security flaws but it's just so damn useful when you're trying to share a file with windows and you just can't get windows SMB to either announce or see the network (happens between windows as well, not a mac thing just for the record :0) you can just flip on FTP and get stuff done... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Yea, macs arent designed to be operable without a mouse so those holdovers (useful as they are) didnt make it. There are keyboard shortcuts for defulat dialog actions (escape is cancel, enter is accept, command D takes the open/save dialog to the desktop, etc. I'm sure there's a googleable list somewhere...) but no total interaction replacements (like arrowing around through buttons in a dialog). You may be able to find an application that will do that though, there's nothing stopping it in the os, it's just not there by default.<br><br>The file system on the Mac specifically isn't intended to be browsed with the keyboard. But you can do it using command functions. They're far less convenient (because they don't want you to really do that...) but they are listed under the menus so you don't need to know the actions, you can just look for them... Again, more mouse/GUI focused, no history of keyboad usage. And again I would wager there's an application or other hack that adds windows style support, Linux's support is based off trying to replicate a windows like environment since that's what most people are familiar with... There are some GUIs for Linux that in turn try to replicate the Mac, but a tiny disibution platform trying to replicate a small distribution platform rather than a GIANT distribution platform doesn't make a lot of sense most of the time... But the fact they exist is sort of the point of Linux, just do whatever you like, it's all open :0)<br><br>Wether that is good, bad or neutral is down to personal habits. We all prefer what we're comfortable with :0) personally I tear my hair out with the arrow keys in a text field on windows. When things are selected pressing right takes you to the beggining... On the left... Because presumably you want to move the cursor that doesn't yet exist to the right, rather than insert it on the right... Both ways are right and wrong, all depends on which you're used to for what's natural. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
