Post Snow Leopard Rosetta has been fully removed and your options are either dual OS installs (which I would recommend, btw just install Snow Leopard on a flash drive for the rare occasions you need it without messing with your main drives) or through a complicated emulator setup which may introduce some compatibility issues depending on a million factors.<br><br>Simple solution, install SL on a flash drive, boot from that, launch the PPC app which will install Rosetta.

I've never had good experiences with VM'd OS X installs. 10.6.3 *might* work on a 2011 iMac even though it's not officially supported if it's a true retail disc and not a system restore disc. Would try it first before wrstling with VM's, nothing to lose, it either boots or doesn't. Failing that I would look for another system to try to make a boot flash drive on and then if desired image that boot drive to your partition if you really want it internal. If no other system is available even to make a boot flash drive, and it won't install/boot from the older install disc, and you have no way to get a newer disc image, only then would I consider going the VM route (just too many headaches vs. any other solution, but you only have access to what you have access to). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's only <i>supposed</i> to be a problem when you don't have an OSX host.

What application can't be run from a virtual machine? If you're hoping to run a game or other high-demand graphical app, I have bad news for you: these will function even less well under Rosetta than they generally do in regular virtual machines. Rosetta is not suitable for high-performance tasks, so if it won't work in a VM... it probably won't work at all. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Miraculous Rosetta added some overhead true.  However, even the early Intel Macs were more powerful than most PPC Macs where those games were developed.  Result was little if any net performance loss.  Never had a complaint that SteamTRAIN didn't run well under OSX 10.5 and 10.6 on many Intel Macs.  Why Apple prematurely killed off Rosetta is yet another mystery? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
