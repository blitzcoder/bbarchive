I had one cable to convert it into the three connections, cyan, darkblue and red. I tried those at first. When I do I see on my TV everything in purple, either the Mac or the TV seems totally unable to get a clear screen and as soon as the desktop should appear the screen turns blank black and there it ends.<br><br>Now my TV DOES have a PC connector, so let's try that. I get the apple logo perfectly clear on my screen with no problem at all, so far so good, then the screen turns skyblue with a mouse cursor on the screen, which is normal for slow starting macs before the desktop appears and then.... pop... black blank screen and no way at all to get anything visible.<br><br>I've tried the safe mode to get around this, but the effect remained the same. <br><br>Some guy blamed my TV's resolution being too low, but that's bullcrap. I have a monitor which I have since even BEFORE Windows 95 came out which I used for my old DOS computer and MacOS X runs perfectly on that thing with the same an even lower resolution (640x480 should really be the max that thing can handle). It is clear to me that MacOS tries to scan what kind of monitor is connected and turns black blank when it can't detect the monitor (this always happens to me when I forget to turn on the monitor, just put the Mac to sleep (shortly pushing power will do that) and press a random key to come out and tada, fixed), and to me it's clear that my Mac can't detect my TV. <br><br>In both scenario's written above I can of course put the mac to sleep and activate it again. In my first scenario, I see purple unreadable screen for about 1 second and then blank screen, in scenario #2 nothing seems to happen at all.<br><br><br><br><br>Now I really wonder if there's some way to get this running somehow. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I too have had the black screen when I forgot to turn it on when booting the mac. I would see what resolution the tv supports and its hertz then set that in the mac's preferences this should at least clear that hurdle. If after that it still wont play then I would try it on a different TV. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The picture quality will be significantly better than with a VGA cable. <br><br>The real problem in the end might be this: Your PPC Mac Mini will only be good to play back DVDs and DVD-rips; any rip that has an HD or Full HD resolution will turn the Mini into a dia show. We still have two G4 PowerPC Macs in our house and MKVs/BluRay rips simply kill them. If DVD quality is good enough for you, then of course the Mini will do just fine.<br><br>You might want to try XBMC OSXPPC on your Mac:<br><a href="http://xbmc.org/download/" target="_blank">http://xbmc.org/download/</a><br><br>I use a Zotac Zbox ID41+ (http://www.zotacusa.com/zbox-id41.html) with openelec (http://openelec.tv) as our media center system -- that solution is cheap and works beautifully even with 1080p MKVs. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

As VLC player ignores those region codes (and VLC still works on PPC) I was hoping the Mac Mini could save me here. I don't like watching movies at a desktop screen :)<br><br>I might try the other software you suggested as well.<br><br>By the way, the monitor I could get my Mac Mini to work on is an old tube monitor. But may it's because it is a computer monitor that MacMini recognises it... A TV could be a different story. I don't know... Just speculating here, I've always been in the dark when it comes to hardware.<br><br><br>I'll try to sort something out with this new information ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Some TVs don't have 640x480 (very old early models), it could also be, as suggested, the number of Hz. Some TVs support up to 59Hz for some odd reason, but not 60. However you can be certain that in most cases 50Hz will work just fine.<br><br>I wouldn't suggest an HDMI cable or adapters like that, since the machine is too old to do that.

Since it goes black something is changing that's causing it to go into a mode that the TV doesn't support. The problem is either that the TV doesn't support a decent resolution that the computer is trying to use, OR that the computer isn't detecting and switching down properly depending on who you feel like blaming.<br><br>If the TV has HDMI get a DVI-&gt;HDMI cable, you can find them on amazon for &lt;$5 shipped. fewer adapters = fewer things messing with the signal and therefore less to go wrong. Also keeping it fully digital lets the devices talk to each other better and sort out supported resolutions and refresh rates more accurately.<br><br>If the TV doesn't have HDMI, but does have VGA, connect your mac to a monitor and set the resolution as low as it will go and the refresh rate low as well, and then hot swap it to the TV and see if it likes it. Repeat until you find something that works.<br><br>If all that fails you will need a converter to change VGA to SVideo, component, or whatever to get a signal that the TV will agree with. But this shouldn't be needed if there's any other way to connect the 2. It's just a matter of finding settings that they can both agree on, which is definitely possible since you can see the boot screen.<br><br>Another thing, if you have anything launching at startup on the mac it might be responsible for the resolution reset. Best thing to do would be to start with a clean OS install if you're just going to use it as an HTPC anyway. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
