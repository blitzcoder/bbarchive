They are uncooperative out of the box and tweaking them to work (particularly wireless networking on powerbooks) generally requires configuring the network to not use encryption, ie just plain text - so in short, Macs on a PC based network generally requires the network to be unsecure.  OSX is completely incompatible with Active Directory (whereas OS9 was!).<br><br>Silly off topic networking issues aside, my experience with Macs in general use (which includes very old G3s up to high powered G5s), is that they are slow, glitchy and when doing anything remotely network or internet related (mostly in the Finder and some System Panel apps) completely unresponsive.  My experience is with OS 10.3.8, as 10.3.9 and 10.4 break most of the programs we use at work.  But there have been too many times where for no reason at all an app becomes unresponsive or stalls with the rainbow pointer for an unreasable amount of time - and depending on the program a force quit will render the rest of the OS unstable until a reboot. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

On the place where I live I have no own phone lines or cable connections. All private computers are connected to a router which gives the internet, and that's all I know about it. So I do not know how a Mac would fit in that. There's a lot I know about computers and programming in general, but I'm a dummy when it comes to the network part of it.

Ubuntu never crashes but I dont fully understand the Linux OS and when things dont work as they should I get really frustrated trying to sort them out. Machine 3 is a MAC Powerbook 15" with OS X Tiger, the powerbook is by far my favourite machine, well designed and built to last it screams quality. OS X is foolproof and so far has been fail proof too, it does everything I want and is quite snappy. All machines access the net via a wireless connection and share a printer and files without problems.

That was the first thing that came to my mind, as well. I once had to buy the cheapest computer out of the fact that my ex-girl-friend stole a lot of money from me, and I got nothing but trouble with it (but now I wonder where the true problem lies. Is it the fact that it was a low-budget-PC of the fact that it was run by Windows?) Of course I won't say that mini-Mac would come up with the same concequences, but I've always been skeptic about cheap stuff. A few bad experiences with cheap devices in general will do that. That's why I asked if the step to mini Mac in order to try things out and switch over to a iMac would be a good idea. I mean trying things out you're unfamiliar with for a low price is great, but paying twice while you could do it once is in the end a lot more expensive. I hope you understand why this is a hard decision for me. Giving up an OS you're used to for something unknown does come with doubts, even when the familiar OS is nothing but trouble.

Most new software runs on old computers, but the most important part is that you need a new Mac OS, which generally runs fine on older hardware. But it also works vice-versa, and I even can play a 13 years old tetris game on the newest mac os!<br><br>A mac mini is a good decision if you already got a usb keyboard and mouse (and yes, the mac works perfectly with a 2-button mouse ;-).

Well... keyboard and mouse do not need to be very expensive, but I also have the purchase of a new monitor in consideration (my current one sucks), but as far as I know my Windows Monitor (even though it sucks) can be connected to a Mac Mini without trouble (at least not more than I already have), so maybe that's not the big hurry, but you can understand, if I already have to throw away a lot of money, I want to do it right.

The Mac Mini was a disaster out fo the box... constant crashing and slow performance, even being unable to play a simple solitaire game I downloaded for her off the Internet. The problem is that it only comes with 256MB which is not even close to being adequate to run OSX 10.4 and if you don't have enough RAM, OSX is a swap-file pig. You couple that with the Mini's slow hard drive and you've got real problems. The first thing you have to do is upgrade to 512MB which will involved using a couple of putty knives to pry the "tamper-proof" case apart. It can be done but takes patience. Once you do the upgrade, the machine runs like a champ. I have the 1.42GHz version and it really is a great machine... that is after it has been upgraded. Keep in mind that the Mini is picky about the type of RAM you use, so be sure it will work otherwise you may only get 512MB usable from a 1GB stick... another lesson I learned the hard way.<br><br>Another problem was with Wi-Fi and nto being able to find a USB Wi-Fi card with Mac drivers. I finally ended up going with one of those Game console Wi-Fi adapters and just plugging the Ethernet out of the mini directly into that. It works pretty well and supports B/G, WEP, etc.<br><br>OSX is a sweet OS.. no doubt. Software availability will keep me from switching over but the OS itself is pretty nice.<br>Good Luck! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
