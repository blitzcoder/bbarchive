I am excited to announce that I just bought a new Intel iMac 2.0GHz Core 2 Duo, due to arrive next week. :-)<br><br>The cool thing about these Intel Mac's (or `Mactel's` as they seem to be called) is you can run Windows and Linux natively on the CPU, ie full speed not emulated.<br><br>Naturally this is a great thing for BlitzMax development because it means that if you put OSX, Windows and Linux onto the hard drive as separately bootable os's you can create BlitzMax applications for all three platforms. I fortunately also have a PPC iMac running OSX Panther which completes the lineup to allow me to create software on all four BlitzMax platforms. This is cool.<br><br>So, obviously, to prepare the way for installing Windows and Linux in addition to OSX Tiger (at some time in the future) I have to partition the harddrive (160GB) in the correct way so that, when I am ready to, I can install these 3 os's and get them booting.<br><br>I know the Parallels desktop software is able to boot more than one os simultaneously which is probably cool and I might look into that when the time comes. I'm not ready to put Linux and Windows onto the machine yet, as I don't own them, so I want to go with just OSX Tiger for now, but obviously you have to partition everything ahead of time otherwise when it comes time to install the other 2 os's I would have to wipe out all my OSX data. I'd like to avoid that. I would prefer to partition correctly `up front` and then work off the OSX drive until I'm ready to make the upgrade.<br><br>Can anyone recommend any websites or instructions for what I should do (with DiskUtil?) to properly partition the harddrive to the correct formats to support the three os's? I am thinking probably like a 80GB OSX partition, a 40GB or 50GB Windows partition and a 30 or 40GB Linux partition. It is possible that the Windows I'll install will be Vista since it's the most up-to-date and XP will have less longevity. Any advice is very much welcome.<br><br>I'm looking forward to creating software for all these platforms. BlitzMax is cool! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's an Intel cpu, the software runs natively on the cpu. Windows thinks it is on the C: drive and that it is a totally normal piece of PC hardware. Everything that runs under windows then runs normally. Same for Linux.<br><br>It seems maybe that 64-bit Vista is not supported yet, though, but the 32-bit version is. ALso it seems if you want to be able to read and write to the windows partition from osx you have to use the FAT32 filesystem for windows which limits the partition to 32gig. Not sure if this is big enough for me, and using the NTFS filesystem prevents writing from osx.<br><br>At the moment I'm thinking of how to do the partitioning part of things, to get ready for when I'm ready to install.

You will have problems with 3D support on the iMac, though. If you ordered the 24" iMac, you're quite lucky, because it uses an nVidia chip and nVidia provides drivers for x86 Linux.<br><br>With ATI, in my experience you're not so well off. However, Sabayon Linux actually ran with an accelerated 3D desktop on my 20" iMac, but not at the full 1680x1050. I only ran it from the live CD and never installed it on my HD and configured it properly, though. I don't care much for Linux, I only "play" with it once in a while out of curiosity. I'm more interested in FreeBSD, but that's a different story.<br><br>The BootCamp wizard does the partitioning for Windows for you, and I don't think you should partition the disk manually. <br><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp." target="_blank">http://www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp.</a><br><br>Maybe this helps with the triple setup that you want to do:<br><a href="http://wiki.onmac.net/index.php/Triple_Boot_via_BootCamp" target="_blank">http://wiki.onmac.net/index.php/Triple_Boot_via_BootCamp</a><br>There are other guides also on the net, but I never tested one myself. <br><br>Parallels has come a long way and usually does most of the stuff that I need. I have Vista Ultimate 32 Bit installed natively and Half-Life 2 runs great on it. Stalker, however, performs shitty on Vista and I have not (yet) tried anything else. I usually spend my time with OS X on my private machines and only need Windows to play some games that have not yet been ported to the Mac.<br><br>I even once had Parallels working with a Windows XP BootCamp partition. It does not work with Vista, and when you use XP, you should make sure that it is a volume licence version. The normal OEM version wants to be re-activated (at least my version did that). At work, with a volume license version, I did not have that problem.<br><br>As for the 32 Gig limitation: BootCamp behaves somewhat inconsistent here. My iMac at work has a 500 GB hard disk built in, and BootCamp actually resized it to two 250 GB partitions of which now Vista occupies one.<br><br>On my iMac at home with a 250 GB HD, BootCamp only managed to give me a 32 GB partition for Vista. Whenever I tried to assign more than that, the resizing failed with an error message. I never found out why.<br><br>Anyway, with MacDrive 7 by MediaFour, Vista can fully use all my OS X volumes, so it is not really a problem for me.<br><br>For what you want to do, you should spend the few extra bucks for Parallels Desktop and MediaFour MacDrive 7.<br><br>Well, good luck and have some fun with your new machine! :-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you make it larger than 32gig it has to use NTFS filesystem which cannot be written to from OSX. So I guess it's a tradeoff. I am wondering how, if I couldn't write to the windows partition, I'd exchange files between them, perhaps with some online web server thing?<br><br>I am looking at Kubuntu as the Linux of choice, recommended by a cousin and it seems to be a popular choice for BlitzMax users. I know nothing about Linux at this point. Am wondering how much harddrive space to allocate to these other os's. I am wondering if 32gig would be too little for Windows. I hear Vista uses up at least 15 gig and needs like 5 gig for virtual mem, leaving only 12 for programs/data/development etc (out of 32). As to Linux, not sure how much to allot there. Perhaps just 32 gig would do, so 64gig total, leaving 96gig for OSX which will be my os of choice and most used. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

BootCamp could create a 250 GB partition on the 500 GB HDD, but it failed on the other iMac at creating a 40 GB partition on a 250GB HDD. Well, BootCamp is still beta software, so that could be the reason.<br><br>If you only need to exchange software between Windows and OS X on the same machine, install MacDrive 7 in Windows and you will be able to read from and write to any HFS+ partition. It should be sufficient to have one OS with full read and write capabilities to the other systems.<br><br>If you need to exchange data between Linux, OS X and XP/Vista, you need a FAT32 "exchange" partition either on the main hard disk or on a second (external) hard disk. That is the only file system fully supported by all three systems.<br><br>As for the HD requirements: Vista requires an absolute minimum of 10 GB HD space just for itself - and that is BEFORE you install any updates or "Ultimate Extras". For example, if you download and install all additional language packs for Vista Ultimate, you are getting close to those 15 GB quickly. <br><br>My Vista installation at home consists of Vista Ultimate plus all downloadable extras, Visual Studio and currently Half Life I (Source), Half Life 2, Half Life 2 Episode 1 and HL 2 Death Match and Lost Coast. Together, that's around 29 GB. The rest is on HFS+ partitions that I access through MacDrive.<br><br>My Vista installation at work needs around 70 GB:  Vista + Office + Visual Studio and a few rather small utilities, that's basically it. So, YES, Vista IS extremely hungry.<br><br>In comparison, on a 100 GB HDD I can install OS X Tiger, Final Cut Studio (around 25 GB), Propellerhead Reason, iWork, Photoshop CS3, Flash CS3, Flex Builder 2, XCode, Unreal Tournament 2004 (10 GB), all five Apple Jam Packs plus a third party jam pack (around 40 GB) and a few other small applications. Ok, that disk is completely full, but I still have a working system. However, if you will have a similar software setup, you should allocate at least 120 to 160 GB for OS X. <br><br>I think 100 GB is a bit too tight for either OS X and Windows.<br><br>Linux is a different story. Since you probably won't be using it as your "bread and butter" system, it can fit very well in a 40 GB partition or VM, I'd say. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

OSX will be my main partition and o/s of choice, I don't really intend to do a whole of stuff in windows other than using it as a development platform for BlitzMax, for testing software and ensuring cross-platform performance. I don't plan to be installing lots of games and stuff on it, or even tools to make games. Any extra software and tools will be on OSX.<br><br>I am a little concerned, after what you've said, that Vista eats a lot of space and there wouldn't be very much leeway with 32GB, but then, going for a larger partition would mean not being able to write from OSX. I want OSX to be the main platform and to then copy data to/from the other two. I suppose if that Windows software can see the mac drive I can have windows `read` the OSX data. Can Linux read the Mac partition or would it have to copy from Windows (if it ends up being FAT32)?<br><br>My drive will be 160GB, which is the largest I've ever owned so far. Considering I used to get by on an Amiga with a 2 GB harddrive with 5 partitions, I'm hoping that 160 will be enough for the three os's. I know also that you probably don't get to access the full 160GB sine some space is used for file management etc. So in that light, a 32GB FAT32 Windows partition and a 32GB Unix Linux partition, leaving around 90GB for OSX, sounds pretty decent to me. Of course it'd be nice to have like 100GB for each, but hey. It's not like I'm trying to have three heavily populated os's with equal amounts of applications on each. I might consider going with, say, 40 or 50GB for windows just because it's hungry, then 30 for Linux and 80 for OSX. Sound reasonable? I don't really want to end up with lots of unused space on Linux and Windows, either, that could be used by OSX.<br><br>As to versions of Vista, is the bog standard `home` editition (the most basic one) good enough for blitzmax development? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Vista and its new security features are a real bitch. And since you are only going to use Vista Standard: Why don't you just stay with XP? It is faster than Vista and when you install the Microsoft Zune Theme for XP, it even looks like Vista Home Basic... (Vista Home Basic does NOT have the new user interface, only Home Premium and "higher" have it.)<br><br>Honestly. I have not yet found ONE single reason why somebody should upgrade to Vista. Right now, Vista only makes ones life harder due to all its incompatibilities to existing software, it is slower and I even have seen bluescreens again (not only on Macs, but also on Dells). On XP, bluescreens have become a relict of the past, but on Vista they are ocassionaly fired again. Not very often, but it happens. <br><br>On Linux, there should be a good chance that HFS+ is supported as a mountable file system. After all, Darwin, the FreeBSD-based foundation of OS X, is open source, so somebody will probably have ported the file system driver to Linux.<br><br>You can also try and reduce that Linux partition down to 10-15 GB. Since full blown Linux distros can run off a Live CD or DVD, that size should be sufficient for a development Linux system.<br><br>If you chose XP instead of Vista, you can also go down to 10-15 GB for a dev system. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So that frees up the idea of having a 32mb limit and having to use FAT32. I think Windows would be somewhat happer with more space since it is so hungry and bloated, like maybe 50mb would  be better. I am happy to put Linux on the drive and have it use maybe 20-30mb. Then the remaining can be osx.<br><br>One thing to note, to have the 3 os's installed on the same drive based on being compatible with OSX, OSX uses different data types and can only allow 3 partitions on the drive. So there could not be an extra FAT32 partition. There is only room for windows, linux and osx partitions. It's have to be on a separate harddrive. Something I may keep in mind for the future. I think I will go NTFS for windows, and decide later whether it's worth going with Vista. I want it to be vista mainly only because XP will be phased out and Vista is the most up-to-date beast to deal with. Also I think I would aim for the Home Premium edition, which takes a bit more drive space but has aero and various other features.<br><br>Xlsior, I agree, that's why I tried to avoid the low end `shared memory with motherboard` graphics card systems. That rules out all the mac mini's I think, and also the lowest end iMac. It's only in the 17" 2.0 GHz imac that you begin to get a proper graphics card with dedicated video ram - many times faster than the intel jobby. It also is good enough to support directx9 and shadermodel 2 so vista aero will run on it, plus supports OpenGL 2.0 fully. The ATI Mobility X1600 seems like a pretty reasonable mid-range card for BlitzMax apps - about 2-4 times faster than the GeForce4MX that I have in my current mac.<br><br>We also just made the switch to wireless.

Looking forward to seeing how the new `Bonjour` networking thing turns out on the new imac.<br><br>I'm also glad to be getting a `mighty mouse` .... includes a 360 degree scroll wheel thing which is also a button, left and right mouse buttons, and an extra two side buttons, and it's wireless.
