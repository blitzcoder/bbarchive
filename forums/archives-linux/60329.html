There was all this manual file editing and parameter specifying, and I ended up destroying my graphical desktop - only the CLI would come up - half a dozen times (each time requiring a full reinstall since I knew of no other way to fix it) before I gave up completely.  I envied how easy Nvidia cards seemed to have things under Ubuntu (from what I read, getting them fully accelerated was a snap).<br><br>With 5.10, I was able to get the simpler ATI instructions working, largely because I'd learned my way around the terminal and other aspects needed with my earlier failed attempts. And with 6.06, my ATI card worked fine right after install, and I didn't need to do anything.<br><br>So, I can understand if others are having trouble getting accelerated video to work - I was there myself. It was only a combination of Ubuntu getting "easier" (for ATI), learning how things worked in it, and probably some luck that things went easier later on. But I sure remember how frustrating my repeated failures were with my early encounters with Linux, both Red Hat and Ubuntu (especially the shock that any modern OS would have returned to the DOS days of manual file editing and CLI - good gravy, this isn't 1986! &lt;g&gt;).<br><br>Now, I was pleased by several things in 6.06. For example, the now-graphical installation in place of text-based is finally up to modern Windows standards (and I loved being able to surf with Firefox while the install went on, which makes the XP installer look sad). But there are a few rough spots, like the new partitioner (I managed to wipe out my 5.10 partition, even though I never had any such troubles with the 5.10 or 5.04 text-based partitioners), and like Nvidia cards seemingly becoming as hard to accelerate as ATI cards were under 5.x (though at least some ATI cards have gotten easier). So, it looks like 6.06 is a jump forward overall, but with some steps backward in some areas. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I tried mandrake and red hat in some distant past, but they very quicky found the garbage bin. This time it looks like i have a winner. <br><br>Very decent support for even the most obscure hardware.<br>Getting my videocard/soundcard and periphirals to work was pretty easy. Appart from some minor things, I've got everything I need pretty much set up and running now.<br><br>Im stilla linux n00b, so its gonna take some time to get comfortable with things like bash and the filesystem in general, but im sure thats a matter of practise.<br><br>Ubuntu ftw!<br><br><br>[edit] A note on Compiz/Xgl for NVidia users,<br>Don't bother installing it if you are planning on using 3D apps and/or watching any kind of video/dvd on ubuntu, as Compiz thouroughly messes this up. Compiz also messes up access to the NVidia Controlpanel. The only way to get these working properly again, is to disable Compiz alltogether.  Note that (nvidia-)Xgl is the defacto standard driver for nvidia cards, so you will need that.<br><br>At this point, I can only get it working by booting into gnome, than manually disable GDM (~$ sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop) from the terminal (which throws me out of gnome). Then log into the terminal and manually start X  (~$ startx). Note that GDM should not be reenabled. Now all the 3d/video stuff, as well as the nvidia control panel work again.<br><br>I really need to find a way to permanently remove Compiz from the system. But i simply lack the knowledge of ubuntu in general to do it atm. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I now have dual monitors but lost all hardware acceleration and a few other abnormalities. rather annoying when i can just boot to windows and it work in a matter of minutes. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
