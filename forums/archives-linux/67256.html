(Of course, since this is the development version, there are still tons of crashes).<br>There are also some new apps in the repositories (another rather dumb thing: Why don't they add stuff over time? Why do the repos need to be stocked up pre-release and hardly at all post-release?).<br>Compiz by default is deferred... AGAIN...

I mean, Edgy is nice, but Dapper is far easier to REALLY make for a perfect Linux experience, IMHO.  I happen to like Edubuntu a bit, since I have just recently d/led all four desktop packages.  It seems to give you all the tools you need to make a real nice Blitz game, which is nice of them to have this version.<br><br>However, since I DID download Edubuntu, it seems like Edubuntu boots up for my GNOME session instead of Ubuntu.  It's almost like it replaced Ubuntu for that session...  Is there a way to separate Ubuntu from Edubuntu for two separate GNOME desktops?  I mean, all four desktops are nice, but with two GNOME-based desktops, I can't seem to get too much of a choice now... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
