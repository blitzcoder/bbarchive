Regardless of  how ambitious I feel on any given day I always forget why I hate linux until I have to dive back into it again.

It's quite nice, and I like the independant design of it, and with X Windows + KDE it looks just the same as any Linux with KDE.<br>It runs windows apps with decent speed, but needs some finetuning to support a broader variety of windows apps.<br><br>Then I tried Debian 5.0. It is amazing! It's much more professional than Ubuntu and Mint, and Ubuntu is a derivate of Debian, and Mint is a derivate of Ubuntu. It seems all they did in Ubuntu and Mint is just to bloat it, and bring more bugs and slowness into it. Debian raw is insanely fast, stable, and easy to use. There's no point to derive from it. Besides, Debian supports like 10 hardware systems, while Ubuntu and Mint supports only Intel.<br><br>So now my favorite OS is Debian, but I'm still giving FreeBSD or NetBSD a second look.<br><br>But what really amazed me about Debian, is that it runs Windows apps faster than Windows XP (which runs Windows apps faster than Vista and Win 7). No Linux wine has done that before. I got 301 FPS in WinXP, and 303 FPS in Debian for the same Leadwerks Engine 2.3 app. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
