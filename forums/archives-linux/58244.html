The nice thing is that you can copy things back and forth between your real OS and the guest OS, and are able to do things like compile your blitzmax exe's.<br>Note that full screen openGL may not be supported, so you can only run the bmax apps in windowed mode. It will also be a bit slower than running in a 'real' linux installation where it has full control over your hardware...

I eventually persuaded myself last night to install Ubuntu (5.10) as a separate partion on my HDD. The GRUB program that comes with it allows me to choose which O/S I want to boot from and I've managed to get BlitzMax up and running. <br><br>Two more question though, in Windows when you are at a console and you're in a directory that contains an executable you just type the name of the EXE and it will run. However in Linux, if I "cd" to my BlitzMax folder and type "MaxIDE", it says something like <pre class=code>Bash: MaxIDE: Command not found</pre>. I read somewhere you need to type instead: <pre class=code>.\MaxIDE</pre> and this appears to work. What does the ".\" do and how can I find a way of executing the MaxIDE exe from the console in any folder.

Under DOS this is assumed to be desired by default, under linux you need to specify you want to run the version in your current directory<br><br>Related to this, you can also do the following:<br><br>../whatever<br><br>.. means the parent directory of your current one, so ../something will go UP one level and run a program in that folder.<br><br>../../../whatever will go up three levels,<br><br>/whatever (without the leading period) means run the program 'whatever' in the root folder of the filesystem.<br><br>/etc/whatever would run the program 'whatever' under the 'etc' subfolder of the root partition, etc...<br><br>~/whatever means go to the currently logged in user's home folder (~) and run program 'whatever' in that directory<br><br>also, since it sounds like you're not very familiar with linux filesystems yet: Keep in mind that under Linux/Unix/Mac, the file and directory names are CASE SENSITIVE.<br><br>This means that MaxIDE, MAXIDE and maxIDE are considered to be three distinct files, so if it is spelled MaxIDE, you can't launch it as ./maxide --- "file not found".<br><br>You can add the 'current folder' to your path so it will automatically 'find' files in it. Where to configure that depends on what shell you're running, the location varies.<br><br>If you're running bash:<br><br>look in /etc/.bashrc (affecting all users) or ~/.bashrc (affecting just you)<br>you would want to add the '.' folder to your path to include the current directory. <br><br>Oh, that's another thing: a trailing period in front of a file names means it's a hidden file. those won't show up when you do a regular listing with ls, you need to do ls -a to view the hidden files as well.<br><br>Anyway, while it can be convenient not having to specify the folder when running programs, it also makes things a less secure. For example, since all commands are seperate executables, it's possible for a piece of malware to put its own version of 'cd' or 'rm' in its own folder. Should someone manage to get something on your system through an exploit or something, you risk that you see something weird, enter its folder, thing 'hey, that shouldn't be there' -- type 'rm *' to try to erase, and unwittingly run the mystery 'rm' executable they had dropped in that folder as well, that could do who-knows-what to your system.<br><br>So... default folder not in your path may be a tad inconvenient at times (although you get used to this behaviour *very* quickly), it definitely helps in the damage control department. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

My copy of Ubuntu should be coming in tomorrow.  Now, I just have to try getting rid of Xandros when that arrives.  Even tho Xandros was nice, it's time to reformat my partition, and transition from an okay Linux system to a GREAT Linux system.  I even gave SUSE an opportunity, but unfortunately, Novell didn't even want to install right, neither did Red Hat Fedora.  I guess the little guy's distros far outdo the big guys out there.  I can only imagine that those big egomaniacs are really feeling jealous about some of these little distros doing so well.<br><br>Now, if I were to build my own Linux-based OS, I'd probably model my version of Linux around the Mac OS X style layout, not Windows like everyone else.  To me, Mac's GUI's far superior to the MS layout in every way.  I just happen to love that pull-down menu and the hotlink graphics that scroll on the bottom of the screen.  I only wish that Linux would start to be like Apple's OS (of course, if Mac OS X were legal to install, I would've done so a looong time ago).  I think that Ubuntu takes after this style fairly well, seeing those screenshots on their website.  Then again, their "Windows" still looks like the M$ style, but I'll have to make do with that. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
