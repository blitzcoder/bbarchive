The new Ubuntu uses Compiz and when I ran the Digesteroids example which runs fullscreen it ran fine but when I quit it my desktop didnt restore.. It still had the remains of the game on the screen.. I had to select the maxIde and drag it around the screen to get the screen back ( the MaxIde was the only app which redrew itself .. minus the borders.<br><br>I guess Blitz doesnt do something required to force the OS to redraw the whole screen when it quits.<br><br>Still..

Using the installation guide thread to get all the required packages in the list worked for me.

Thats why I ended up backing up all my home directory and just doing a full install.<br><br>I dont know enough about linux and the distribution packages but it would be nice for newbies if BMax could be packaged up so it will automatically include all required packages and maybe even add itself to the menu. I realize it probably depends on what flavour of linux your using but they are all based around a few core distro's arnt they ?<br>even just supporting 1 flavour would be good or including instructions with the download on what to do to get it working.<br><br>A total Linux newbie would get as far as downloading the demo.. finding it doesnt work and moving on.<br>Everything else for Linux seems to be packaged up so users can just click on the downloaded file and the package manager opens it up and includes all the additional packages automatically.<br>I seriously doubt any new visitor actually goes on the forums to find out how to get it working just to give it a try.<br><br>It seems like windows is the only easy platform. On the mac I had to go to apples site.. register as a developer so I could get whatever the heck it was I needed to get Max to work and linux requires you to download lots of additional libs etc before it works and the only way to find that out is to visit the forums and find the right thread.<br><br>If blitz cant or dont have time to do it does anyone here have the knowledge and time to simplify things for the Linux platform ?<br>It might persuade more Linux people to try it. In fact if you could get the demo version it all packaged up maybe it could get included in actual Linux distributions.
