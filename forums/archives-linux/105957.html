In the case of this game it didn't really matter since the launcher only uses notify to warn you for the fact this game is a WIP and not a stable release (and you got it, the notification will be removed once the game has been finished), and the game itself is entirely written for Max2D and has to be able to run in full screen, and then Notify doesn't work anyway (though the game can run windowed if the player desires), but I can at least keep it in mind for upcoming projects in Linux.<br><br><div class="quote"> Linux is case sensitive. <br></div><br>I realized I may have misunderstood something here. You mean there are a few case issues inte Import and Include commands right. That was something I would never see (not even in Linux) because the source was living on an ExFAT device, and ExFAT is case-insensitive. Even Linux will act case insensitive when accessing a device with a partition in the FAT family (My code could not have been compiled at allif it didn't). It would indeed be good to dig through this.<br><br><br>Anyway, thanks a lot guys, I will try out how fruitful this information is going to be. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
