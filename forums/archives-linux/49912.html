<table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr ><td class="posthead"><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr ><td >computercoder</td><td align="right"><font class=tiny>(Posted 2005)</font>&nbsp;<a href="#1">[#1]</a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr ><td class="posttext"> Hello everyone!<br><br>I am new to BlitzMAX, and have followed Blitz Research from the days of BlitzBasic.<br><br>I finally pulled out the green and purchased this fine product from Blitz Research Inc!   I must say IT IS GREAT! (uh... I have used only the Windows version with a full compile, but the Linux edition is much the same!)<br><br>That said. Now to the point.<br><br>I have been a Lindows/Linspire user for several years, and this document is for users of Linspire 5.0 (I am unsure what would happen in 4.5, as 5.0 is a major upgrade -- new kernel! I am guessing BM would still need the same packages, and you could still install all what is required under the older kernel).  I Purchased BlitzMAX to finally create X-Platform programs, where the commands will work the SAME on each platform (Windose, Mac OS-X, and Linux), usually resulting in minimal code changes (if ANY)<br><br>The same problem keeps arising with different distros "What packages are required for BM to run on their distro?"  Hmmm...<br><br>Although I cannot answer this at the moment, I am working on the Linspire distro, which should relate to ALL Debian based systems, if not most major Distros.  Linux is all based on the same Kernel, just a different version/revision. 2.4.x, 2.6.x, etc.  Mainly, those are revisions with added technology advancements built into the Kernel (2.4.x was USB, and some other goodies, 2.6.x improved it,and so on)<br><br>Having noted what Mark Sibly went through, and everyone else, I would like to add my experience thus far.  What a ride it has been!<br><br>First, and foremost, I have YET to get BlitzMAX to fully build and run a program (even though it says it compiled, but I never see a thing).  Also, remember, Linspire uses STABLE releases and CNR follows suit.  Realize that you can by-pass all the nice Linspire appeal, and do things the traditional Linux way :)<br><br>1) If you ARE a CNR member, DO NOT use the "X11 Development Library".  It is OLDER than what is required.  This is version 6.8.1 STABLE &lt;g&gt;, and Mark is using the UNSTABLE version of 6.8.2  <br><br>2) Use the Debian website, and pull out the latest X11 development libraries.  At this point, I am still trying to get the X11 Development Library off my box.<br><br>3) Linspire is built rather intuitively for which GFX drivers to install.  nVidia is what I use, and it already installed all the necessary drivers for GL, GLU, and configuring the xorg.cf... I am not sure that you really need *any* mesa drivers unless your card is that generic.<br><br>4) Linspire, as well as Debian itself, uses the new X-org wrapper to XFree86, and not the XFree86 itself.  So if you must play with the config file, use the /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/config/xorg.cf<br><br><br>Here's the list of what I see so far that was upgraded:<br>gcc<br>g++<br>gobjc (3.3)<br>X11 Development Library (using CNR, like I said, DO NOT use this, go to the Debian website)<br>   This package contains all the stuff you need, but an older 6.8.1 version.<br><br>The list as described by mark Sibly for the X11 stuff:<br>libx11-dev (6.8.2-10)<br>libxext-dev (6.8.2-10)<br>libxi-dev (6.8.2-10)<br>libxkbfile-dev (6.8.2-10)<br>x-dev (6.8.2-10)<br><br>The the GFX stuff, but I am unsure at this point is needed (unless you have a generic GFX card or one not supported in Linux for acceleration):<br>freeglut3-dev (2.2.0-8)<br>libglut3-dev (3.7-25)<br>xlibmesa-gl-dev (6.8.2-10)<br>xlibmesa-glu-dev (6.8.2-10)<br><br>Where I think the problem is that I am getting is maybe in the Mesa driver... as I think more about it.  Here's my error I get when doing a 'Build and Run' in BlitzMAX:<br><br>[Start Output]<br>Building rockout<br>Compiling:rockout.bmx<br>flat assembler version 1.52<br>6 passes, 113037 bytes.<br>Linking:rockout<br>Executing:rockout<br>/home/dan/BlitzMax/samples/hitoro/rockout: symbol lookup error: /home/dan/BlitzMax/samples/hitoro/rockout: undefined symbol: XF86VidModeGetAllModeLines<br><br>Process Complete<br><br>[End Output]<br><br>I am working on a new freshly built PC with Linspire 5.0, sooooo... I will retry all this with nothing on it, as this PC has been morphed over the years with Lindows/Linspire.<br><br>This is where it stands now.  I am hoping to get the process for nailing down what should go with the "complete" usage of Linspire and BlitzMAX!<br><br>If anyone has suggestions, ideas, or corrections, please post a message! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I re-did BlitzMAX from scratch, starting with fresh downloads for both 1.09 and 1.10.<br><br>I installed 1.09, then updated it with 1.10, Syncronized the modules, then did a Rebuild Modules.<br><br>Once I did the Rebuild Modules, I was faced with an error of something to the effect that a header file could not be located, and was found in the X11/extensions, referencing a gl header (I am not at my Linux PC at the moment, so I can't give the actual error message it is still displaying).  My guess is that I am still missing an x11-dev something package (x11-dev_ext??)  This is why I get the error in the previous message I posted above.  I will try locating the missing package, install it, then report back with my progress.  Hopefully, I can establish how to build a working BlitzMAX Linspire 5.0 distro! :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

(These were empty folders... /svn)<br><br>4) Opened BlitzMAX and did a "Syncronize Modules..."<br><br>5) Followed that with "Build Modules", again using the system headers<br><br>6) I loaded rockout, and did a Build and Run...

(drum roll here) Full Screen colorful madness of rockout came to life!!! <br><br>Simply Awesome site to see after a few weeks of messing around with getting it to run under Linux.<br><br>I am planning on making a Public Aisle in Linspire's CNR for BlitzMAX installation.<br><br>I am also gonna make another entry to this Post later with the process of how to get the distribution to work with the tools CNR provides.<br><br>I appreciate ALL help everyone in this forum and particularly this topic thread has afforded to me. :-)  THANKS! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
