Linux is notorious for those inconsistencies, and its developer community does not care enough to fix them. Reason #1 for me why I'd choose FreeBSD over Linux anytime. Reason #2 is performance, reason #3 is the license.<br><br>Talking about licenses: I own two Eschalon licenses, one for OS X and one for Windows. It's a great game and I really enjoyed playing it, but I am certainly not the person who can say whether it was a failure on Linux or not. Ask the folks from Basilisk Games how many Linux licenses they have sold. But since they've got the Linux port pretty cheap through BlitzMax' multi-platform support, it probably doesn't really matter if Eschalon's Linux port is commercially viable or not. But I know that John Carmack said that according to their calculations the Linux port of Doom 3 barely returned the investment they put into it, and my stomach feeling tells me that more Doom 3 copies have been sold than Eschalon copies.<br><br>By the way, I was talking about APPLICATIONS, not games. Just go and write some app for Linux that could be useful for a few people and then let us know how long you will have to wait until some bored teenager writes a lousy open source clone of it after they first have swamped your mail account and forum with complaints why your app is closed source and why they should pay for proprietary software. Here's their great advice for monetizing on your investment: You can make a living with selling merchandise and giving technical support! Yeah, I'm sure that works for everybody.<br><br>If you think that I'm just trolling, fine, I don't really care. But then again, after my own last fruitless effort with Linux (see the wxMax threads), maybe I've finally had enough of the penguins and now am no longer willing to even speak neutral about it. After so many years of development, certain things are simply intolerable and Linux ran out of credit.<br><br>Anyway. This thread was about a sound problem. I still recommend giving OSS a shot and then I'm out of here and will go back to playing Lego Indiana Jones on my Xbox 360. Great game, I love it. :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But Fedora is another Gnome distribution, so you'll probably not be interested.<br><br>Maybe you should re-think your position towards KDE and Gnome. Gnome is where the large Linux companies are, and that for a simple reason: The license. It's much cheaper to write proprietary software for Gnome than for KDE where you have to buy a very expensive Qt license if you want to write closed source software. I asked Trolltech once for a quote for Qt Jambi. Their reply was a questionnaire and they actually wanted to know my income in order to make my an offer. Hello? Anybody home in Norway?<br><br>Anyway.
