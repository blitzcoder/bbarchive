Using a VM is unpredictable. Setting your system up to use Logical Volume Management would allow you to install a few distributions side-by-side, but there are some caveats with some distributions not playing well together.<br><br>Second:<br>swrast_dri.so is the software render driver library. You would normally see this if there were no hardware accelerated drivers available. It is possible on some distributions for this driver to get loaded even when you have installed proprietary drivers. This happens usually with bad configuration where the wrong version of libGL.so gets loaded. The command chpath should be able to rectify this when it happens.<br><br>Third:<br>There are issues with the assembly being generated. Some 64 bit versions of GCC don't like the MMX instructions and with BlitzMax you get an undefined reference error.<br>And with Debian 8; I can only get debug builds to work. Release builds just segfault with no indication of what went wrong. And I frankly I just cannot be arsed to find out and have much better things to do.<br><br>Fourth:<br>ArchLinux and it's derivatives, doesn't have all of the required libraries as binaries that you can install from the repositories. LibXPM4 springs to mind here.<br><br>As I have said in a few posts now. It's time to start looking at alternative tools if you wish to do cross platform software that includes Linux. I cannot see anybody taking the time to fix all the problems that have been in BlitzMax when it was still on sale. Let alone now it's free. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I still do not get completely, why "vanilla BCC" should fail on 64bit (32bit libs) and not on 32bit libs.<br>It translates "code" into "machine language". So if it fails there at specific spots, why does it fail only on a 64bit distro (and then, not on all distros).<br><br>Does it rely on some system functions to calculate addresses where it reads things from during build? I doubt that (as else, the 32bit-build of digesteroids would run on the 64bit one - but it only segfaults with the same reason as the build done on the 64bit OS itself).<br><br>So this is why I do not fully understand what kind of "error" BCC could make that it works on the one OS and not on the other.<br><br>If it wasn't a fault of BCC, it must be the libs... but why then do these libs work with BCC-NG?<br><br><br>Regarding "comparison": #2 contained a small example only requiring a small portion of all modules - dunno if that helps those people being able to understand what is written in the .bmx-files.<br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
