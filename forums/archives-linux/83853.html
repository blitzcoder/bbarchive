Same as if you use something like the Ultimate boot CD for Windows, which can boot XP straight off of a CD -- full access to the harddrive.<br><br>the catch: filesystem security depends on user ID's. for example: Administrator is normally user ID 0. when you connect with a different operating system, now essentially its administrator automatically is user 0, and hence it has full access to the files created by user 0 on the other windows install. The exact same thing applies to Linux, and pretty much all other operating systems.<br><br>This is both good and bad: The bad, as you've seen, is that it's really easy to get access to the files by anyone who has physical access to the PC. The good, is that if/when windows crashes and won't start anymore, you can easily retrieve/rescue your data by simply re-installing a different OS (or connecting the drive in a different PC, or using a liveCD / USB boot)<br><br>You can lock some of those options down by going into your PC BIOS and prohibiting booting from CD or flash drive, and setting a BIOS password to prevent an attacker from changing it back. It still allows them to take out the drive and connect it to a different PC if they're really determined.<br><br>The only way around that is by using encryption -- either windows built-in file encryption (where there is a security certificate used to encrypt each file based on the original username/password hash, and unless you have the certificate you can't access the files)<br>Alternatively is using a 3rd party drive encryption program like TrueCrypt, or the built-in drive encryption feature that comes with some laptops. For those everything is automagically encrypted, and unless you enter a password on boot-up before your OS even loads noone can make sense of the contents of the drive.  Recommended for laptops and such that people take into the field and could get stolen or lost, so their data is still protected.<br><br>However, the big downside of encryption is that if you either forget the password, or something somehow gets damaged, or if windows crashes and you lose its security certificate --- you'd be royally screwed. No way to recover any of your data by hooking it up to a different computer, or reinstalling the OS, or even sending it off to a data-recovery outfit: It's gone, period. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

(and what Xlsior said). Bios protection is rubbish because aside from hard resets and backdoors, all someone need do is have a usb2ide converter and laptop, spoon off the side of your PC, plug on their ide cable and turn on your PC (so it powers the disk) and start browsing. (or remove the disk completely and run away).<br><br>Working IT support i have stripped out many a windows admin password, or done file recovery using a linux bootable media. Wether you love it or hate it, its a hell of a handy tool to have weather you use linux or not.
