There are three images available, each for a different type of computer:<br>PC (Intel x86) live CD<br>For almost all PCs. This includes most machines with Intel/AMD/etc type processors and almost all computers that run Microsoft Windows. Choose this if you are at all unsure.<br>Mac (PowerPC) live CD<br>For Apple Macintosh G3, G4, and G5 computers, including iBooks and PowerBooks.<br>64-bit PC (AMD64) live CD<br>For computers based on the AMD64 or EM64T architecture (e.g., Athlon64, Opteron, EM64T Xeon). It is not necessary for all (even most) processors made by AMD -- only their 64 bit chips. <br></div><br><br>Now let me see if I get this straight....<br>This installs Linux as a side system that does not alter my harddrive formatting at all. And does this mean I can use my already running system (MacOS X or Windows, depend on the machine I'm going to install it) like nothing happened? And most of all, is BlitzMax compatible with this solution? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Chances are you won't get your graphics card 3D acceleration working either.  I don't think you can install these libs/drivers with the Live version, and even if you could, you'd have to do this every time you wanted to compile something for Linux - a major pain in the bum.<br><br>So, I'd recommend the installable version, but only give up a small portion of your HD space to Linux - if all you want to do is use it for BlitzMax.  Make sure you back everything up first, otherwise there could be tears if you accidentally format your entire drive, or something! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Apparantly MaxIDE was not recognized by Ubuntu as an executable. Is that because it's the "Live" version, or is it, because of the fact that the "executable" flag could not be given since I only had Windows formatted disks on the system where I tried it on (I tried it on my old Winodws computer). That's why I've tried the MacLive version, since Mac uses, like Linux, a UNIX based file system. Too bad my CD-Burn software has trouble reading the .iso file. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It did install it on my portable harddisk. But that thing is formatted in FAT32. Maybe there lies a reason.
