How you do a dual boot depends on whether or not you have a proprietary system such as Dell,Acer, etc or if you have a genuine Window 7 retail disk with OEM hardware driver install disks. This has more to do with system recovery if things go wrong.<br>Secondly you must have a reasonable understanding of your computers hardware. <br><br>If your computer is proprietary, then make sure that you have created some proper system recovery disks. Many such systems in this day and age have a hidden recovery partition and some software that you can use to create a set of recovery DVD's should the hard drive or the system become un-bootable. If your system was custom built and you have all the disks, then all you have to worry about is your personal data. If you have never done a dual boot before, I would suggest that you use a virtual machine such as VMWare to practice setting up a dual boot system first before attempting to do the same thing with real hardware as the last thing you want to do is wipe out any important partitions.<br><br><div class="quote"> What's the most popular/easy to install Linux distribution these days? <br></div>You have here a choice here. BRL recommend Ubuntu, but currently the most downloaded according to Distro Watch is Linux Mint. Ubuntu does have the advantage of having a install method that treats it like a windows program, but it may not work on all systems. There are also other methods that can be used that don't have you messing around with your partitions such as installation to a USB memory stick (as long as you can boot from usb). There is one thing to note about any Linux distribution and that is not all hardware is guaranteed to work out of the box (and some may never work at all until some writes a driver for it). Other things to be aware of is whether the system uses EFI instead of BIOS.<br><div class="quote"> Are there any tutorials I need to read for compiling under Linux, <br></div>The are hundreds of tutorials for virtually every language, but you will mostly find Blitz Max related material on the BRL web site.<br><div class="quote">  or is it just a simple matter of installing Linux, installing BM and then compiling and away I go? or is it more involved like it is for Mac (needs XCode etc. before compiling) <br></div>It's a lot more involved than setting up on OS X as you have to set your system up correctly, install the c++ compiler and the development libraries. It also get a lot more complicated if you are using a 64bit distribution. I have written a quick install script to automate the installation of the necessary dependencies for those distributions that are based off of Ubuntu <a href="/posts.php?topic=100580" target="_blank">here</a>. And you will find that even Blitz Max it self will need to be patched because it hasn't been updated in a while. There is another set of scripts that you will either have to download the zip file or copy from a web browser that should handle a few other distributions from <a href="/posts.php?topic=100731" target="_blank">here</a>. These scripts can also install Blitz Max and set it up so it can be run just like another application. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Then installation is usually very simple as the Ubuntu installer will do the work for you (but it's not recommended there's a link to a video below on the best way), just make sure that you back up any important data.

That way you can run Linux in a "safe" - and compatible(!) - environment and learn your way around the OS without killing your Windows installation by accident. <br><br>VirtualBox is free and sufficient for this purpose:<br><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">https://www.virtualbox.org/</a><br><br>Since you want to use BlitzMax on Linux, you can also make your life a whole lot easier by installing a 32-Bit version of Ubuntu. It can be rather messy to get 32-Bit software like BlitzMax running properly on a 64-Bit Linux. There are several threads here that explain perfectly fine what you need to do, but you can significantly improve the odds in your favor by simply sticking with a 32-Bit Linux-distribution. <br><br>My desktop/notebook Linux distribution of choice is Xubuntu 12.04.2 LTS 64-Bit, by the way. It has Ubuntu at its core, but runs the lightweight Xfce desktop instead of the more demanding Unity desktop. But at the end of the day, it is merely a personal preference which desktop you choose. <br><br>It is true, according to Distrowatch, Linux Mint has more downloads than Ubuntu nowadays. But the worth of their statistic is very questionable - no end users will ever visit Distrowatch, their target audience are the hardcore Linux geeks. And let's be frank here - the hard core geeks are no longer the majority of Linux users. I trust Valve's market research more than I trust Distrowatch; they had very valid commercial reasons for officially supporting Ubuntu - and not Linux Mint - when they ported Steam to Linux. If there are end users on Linux, the vast majority of them runs Ubuntu. Especially when you start with Linux, it makes your life easier to use what most others use. <br><br>My last recommendation is to stick with a LTS (Long Term Support) edition instead of the bleeding edge interim releases. Ubuntu 12.04 LTS comes with five years of support, Ubuntu 13.04 only comes with nine months of support. The next LTS version will be 14.04 which is due for release in April next year, and you will be able to upgrade from 12.04 to 14.04. When you choose to install 13.04 now, you will have to upgrade to the forthcoming 13.10 release in October and only then you can upgrade to 14.04 when it will be released next April -- that is one of the prices that you have to pay when you use the bleeding edge interim releases. You get the latest stuff, but you will also have to upgrade your OS very frequently. If you want a stable environment, LTS editions are your friend. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It works beautifully out of the box, but the team's inability to keep up with security updates made it a sense of constant worry that really detracted from the desired non-experience.<br><br>Taking a leap of faith I switched to stock Debian and, surprisingly (to a newbie) - it's completely painless! This isn't the 90s any more, and Debian Stable works pretty much out of the box. Woo.<br><br>The <i>only</i> part where it was more involved than Ubuntu or LMDE or any other "easier" distro was that since Debian only ships Free Software, many wireless cards won't work out of the box and for your first update (right after enabling the nonfree repos - something that takes seconds and an expert can probably walk you through by SMS) you'll need to stand up and plug in a cable to fetch the nonfree firmware. Oh the horror.<br><br>Let a novice user pronounce: Debian itself is suitable for the average consumer.<br><br><br>(Have not done any Maxing yet but I assume it's pretty much the same as LMDE.) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
