And since most distro's are free, the distributor doesn't owe the "customer" anything (unless you pay for an enterprise edition, which presumably comes with support).  That means it's up to the user - namely us &lt;g&gt;.<br><br>From what I've seen, BlitzMax isn't the only program to have problems - it seems like <i>everything</i> has some problems with different flavors of Linux (I've seen lots of "do <i>this</i> with <i>this</i> Linux, but not with <i>that</i> one, which needs <i>this other</i> adjustment").  It looks like there are a good number of user groups out there to help Linux newbies get up to speed, and I've been using what I can understand of them.  I'm <i>very</i> new to Linux, so I sometimes can't use the help shown because it assumes knowledge that I don't yet have.<br><br>But, over the past few days, I've been slowly learning how to do more.  Things seem somewhat easier now than two years ago when I first tried Linux, but it's still quite a lot to deal with.  But that's OK for me: I personally view using BlitzMax with Windows as what's really important. OS X and Linux are nice add-ons if they work, but I'm not that concerned.  That said, I <i>am</i> making the effort to use them, just to undermine Microsoft's monopoly &lt;g&gt;. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That's a great way to put it! &lt;g&gt;.<br><br>One thing about Ubuntu - I now have BlitzMax running in it again, so I compiled Digesteroids and copied that over to Fedora Core 4.  But the compiled program (like BlitzMax itself) wouldn't run there.<br><br>After some more looking, it seemed like the problem was that FC4 uses GCC 4.0 and doesn't have support for older versions enabled by default.  I ran "yum install compat-libstdc++-33" in FC4's Terminal and now Digesteroids and BlitzMax run! &lt;yay&gt;<br><br>This presents an interesting situation - the "official BlitzMax" Ubuntu distro produces "outdated" builds, which the newest Fedora (a major distro) doesn't support.  I put the blame on Fedora for only having the newer GCC installed by default with no initial support for the older version.  That seems like DirectX 9 being released with no support for DirectX 8 or earlier, so that players have to manually download an add-on to play older games that they already own!  <i>Backward</i>-compatability is usually a given in the PC world, but not here.<br><br>If I update Ubuntu-BlitzMax to produce GCC 4 builds, then will people with older Linux installations be able to run them (at least without upgrading to GCC 4)?  I'd think not.  But if I stick with the current Ubuntu GCC, then people with some of the <i>newest</i> Linux installs won't be able to run them without downloading a fix.  What a Catch-22!<br><br>Update: I compiled Digesteroids in FC4 and copied that to Ubuntu 5.04, but it wouldn't run there  (just like FC4 pre-libstdc++-33: no error message - nothing happens at all).  It looks like Ubuntu uses GCC 3.3.  I also tried compiling Digesteroids in XP, and that ran fine in Windows 98.<br><br><br>Wendell<br>Nude in the Linux Darkness <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It has a lot of early releases of new software which aren't well supported in the community yet.  Main one is of course GCC 4.<br><br>99% of commercial products for Linux will not work without the compatibility packages.  Actually installing them is easy enough, and the only reason installing BlitzMax isn't that easy is because it doesn't come in a packaged format that would install these dependencies for you.<br><br>The other thing is that it's perfectly possible to compile stuff for GCC 3 under Fedora Core 4, providing you have the compatibility packages installed.  BMK is currently closed, so this, among other issues (library/header paths) is not something the community can fix for you yet.<br><br>Your best bet for compatibility for the next year or so is to build stuff under GCC 3.  Even when most distros will have moved to GCC 4, all the decent ones (ie. Ubuntu, SuSE, Mandriva) will still include the compatibility libraries for 3.<br><br>As for those having trouble with Accelerated Graphics, if it's not built into your packaging system, most people will be fine using the install scripts provided by Nvidia or ATI on their driver downloads.  I've personally found these tend to actually work better than the included ones.<br><br>The advantage you'll find with Linux is the userbase is generally far more technically inclined than the Windows userbase.  The difference is most people are far more familiar with the Windows way of doing things - on many Linux distros, things are not actually that much harder, they're just unfamiliar.  <br><br>You'll find that once you get your head around apt-get and the like that running Linux actually ends up being a lot easier than keeping Windows chugging along happily.<br><br>As for your Linux end-users, learn how to package your apps.  An RPM or DEB will sort out dependencies for you.  No telling someone to go download Direct X9 or whatever, the package management will do the equivalent of that for your user automatically. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I was unfamiliar with the GCC 3/4 situation; your description made it clearer.  Based on that, I'll stick with Ubuntu for development, but keep FC4 around as a "bleeding edge feature" test (it choked pretty impressively trying to rebuild 1.10's modules: warnings and errors flying everywhere! &lt;g&gt;).<br><br>I've been trying to get accelerated graphics for my Radeon through several means (some folks say "no, don't use ATI's drivers - they'll destroy everything" while others say "yes, they're great").  I managed to get it installed in Ubuntu last night without any conflicts, but now Gnome is unhappy with a new error that I haven't seen before.  Well, different errors usually mean progress &lt;g&gt;, so I'll see about clearing that up later.<br><br>It's good to hear that packaging via RPM/DEB will auto-handle dependencies.  <br><br>BlitzMax has gone much, <i>much</i> smoother for me on Windows and OS X than Linux.  Admittedly I'm a lot more familiar with XP, and have a nodding acquaintance with OS X, but there simply weren't any problems to resolve.  Download/syncmods/rebuild and Max worked on great on both with no additional steps required.<br><br>With Linux it's been nothing but "oh, you need to fix this, which requires updating that, and resolving this other," etc.  And what's with doing everything important in the <i>terminal</i>?  I enjoy the DOS nostalgia and all, but this is 2005, not 1985.... &lt;g&gt;<br><br>It looks like Linux can run 2D, non-accelerated stuff pretty well right "out of the box," but it currently seems unsuited to "modernish" games (say, from the past 5-10 years) which, I guess, is why there are so few for it.  I'll continue to putter with it because I enjoy computers and learning about them, and there's also the challenge of getting BlitzMax working with accelerated graphics and decent sound.  But I have no great hopes of creating anything with it that's anywhere near the stability of XP and OS X versions any time soon. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
