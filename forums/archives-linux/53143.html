I always use that to store my projects, in order to easily switch between Mac and Windows, both platforms are able to read that thing, so no problem there.<br><br>As far as my information goes Linux should be able to read that thing as well, but I'm really out of luck when it comes to Linux. For starters, I don't even know how to access that damn thing from Linux. Since as well Mac as Linux are both UNIX based I was thinking that Linux would access that thing the same as the Mac does. (Having a /Volumes folder in which that device is given up as a folder), but it's very clear that Linux does NOT work that way.<br><br>First of all, I've a BlitzMax download for Linux on my portable harddisk, and I need to install it. How am I gonna do that?<br><br>If somebody can tell me how to access that thing from Linux I'd be very happy.<br><br>(Since my Linux does not operate very well, I think my computer is too old for such a modern Linux version, I'll only use it to make a Linux build, but because of this problem, it was not possible).<br><br>Oh yeah, and what are Linux builds called. I mean, Windows has .exe, Mac has .app, what does Linux have? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Depending on which Linux distro you have, it may work automagically (using automount) and you should be able to find it in /auto/. If not you'll have to mount it manually.<br><br><div class="quote"> How am I gonna do that? <br></div>Depends. Copy it somewhere reasonable /home/username/ or /usr/local/bin/ for instance, and then type "gunzip BlitzMaxSetup112.tar.gz | tar -xvf -" (withuot the double quotes). If you're running some graphical shell you can just click on the Icon for the tar.gz file, and copy the BlitzMAX112 folder somewhere you like.<br><br><div class="quote"> I mean, Windows has .exe, Mac has .app, what does Linux have? <br></div>Binaries or Executables. Linux uses a filesystem flag, rather than a filename extension to determine whether something (binary, script, whatever) is executable, and who has permissions to do so. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
