I'm just whinging about the level of difficulty and effort involved in creating a .deb package. So don't mind me.<br><br>Users "of" the .deb file of course have it easy... :-p <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Thankfully, wxMax has a built-in cross-platform function to do this properly :-)<br><br>I suppose, it shouldn't actually be too hard to create an app to do all this for you - at least in a BlitzMax context of binaries, data and shared objects.<br>GiftWrap expects source that it can compile up itself. Well, the packaging system does too, but you can get around that. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It also couldn't find the .so during the process, so I had to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH before performing the "build". (It would have worked without this, but I prefer not to have warnings if I can help it!)<br><br>So I ended up having it installed in the apps's share lib folder. Not ideal, perhaps, but it works from there.<br><br>Still... I think it *really* wants a little helper app to make the process a lot less effort. I can't imagine having to go through this every time I want to create a new Linux app...<br><br><br>... and of course, I think something like Book I would appear a little more professional were it "self installing" on Linux ;-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
