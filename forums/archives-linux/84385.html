If you can't see and drivers listed it's most likely that you have a Intel graphics chipset or an older nVidia or ATI card and are using the MESA DRI driver. This may cause problems as many features may not be available using these drivers as they are open source (3D and GL acceleration is one).<br><br>If you feel brave you could use the drivers supplied by the video card manufactures. These will be more recent than the restricted drivers, but can be a pain when things go wrong. If you successfully install these drivers make sure that libGL.so (found in /usr/lib or /usr/lib32 or both) is linked to the driver (it may link to another link that is linked to the driver). Note older cards may not be supported so you may have to use older drivers or the restricted drivers.<br><br>Further on in the post is what addition packages will be installed using the following commands.<br><br>In a terminal type<br>For 32bit versions of Ubuntu<br><br><pre class=code>sudo apt-get install gcc libxxf86vm-dev libglu1-mesa-dev build-essential libxft-dev</pre><br><br>For 64bit version of Ubuntu<br><br>I don't know much about these packages listed below but I installed them before I ran the command line below and found that I didn't need to do any softlinks to the necessary libraries for BlitzMax to work on a 64bit install.<br><pre class=code>ia32-apt-get
ia32-libs-tools
ia32-archive</pre><br><br>Note: found out a bit more on the above packages ia32-archive isn't necessary for BlitzMax to work. ia32-apt-get will automatically select ia32-lib-tools, build-essentials and gcc/g++ as ia32-apt-get relies on these.<br><br>Edit: Found a better description of ia32-apt-get<br><div class="quote"> Ia32-apt-get provides wrappers for dpkg.deb and apt-get that allow <br>installing deb packages from an i386 repository (or local file) <br>directly. The apt-get wrapper handles mangling the Packages file from <br>i386 during download so apt can use it and the dpkg.deb wrapper <br>handles converting i386 debs to amd64 / ia64 during unpacking. Through <br>this every i386 package in Debian (or other apt repositories) becomes <br>available on amd64 / ia64 as well. In case of binary/data packages the <br>package name remains as is while for library packages the name is <br>prefixed with ia32- to allow both 64bit and 32bit flavours of <br>libraries to be installed. Package updates become available to the <br>user the moment they hit the archive without needing an extra upload <br>or testing migration.  <br></div><br><br>NOTE UPDATE!: ia32-apt-get has a serious bug and as it's not supported by the canonical, so it wont be fixed in 9.04. But I have seen somewhere that it has been fixed, you just have to build it from source. It's safe for the time being to leave it out but the ia32-libs can not be updated with apt-get. If you have already installed it use apt-get or Synaptic and remove ia32-apt-get ia32-lib-tools. You will also have to remove the repositories that it installs (they have -i386 in them). This is one of the problems as you wont be able to update your system. I have removed the sudo apt-get install ia32-apt-get command from the list be low.<br><br><pre class=code>sudo apt-get install ia32-libs
sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib g++-multilib libxxf86vm-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libxft-dev</pre><br>During installing ia32-apt-get ia32-libs. You will see a window pop-up for postfix configuration. Read the options it gives you and use tab,space and enter to navigate and select the menus. If you don't know what to do select the first item in the list. <br><br>For both Ubuntu 32/64bit<br>If your using MaxGui you will need to add the package below.<br><pre class=code>sudo apt-get install x11proto-xext-dev</pre><br><br>Mark lists libxpm-dev as one of the dependences, but it seems to run ok with out it. So if you have any problems with pixmaps it may be a good idea to install it. <br><br><pre class=code>Additional packages that will be installed with...
