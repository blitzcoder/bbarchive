There are certain things that need to be taken into account.<br><br>1) The official vanilla source BlitzMax is a 32 bit program.<br>You have to over come the technicalities of getting the package to install the 32 bit dependencies it requires to build or run. This isn't easy as you think it would be on a 64 bit debian based system. Unbuntu 12.04 chokes and dies when it hits a dependency in the control file with :i386 even with the Multi-Arch: qualifier set correctly. The solution is to make two packages, one meta package to install the i386 runtime dependencies and the main package to install the development packages.<br><br>2) BlitzMax was written to be self contained.<br>This will cause problems with file permissions. You could set the file permissions and groups to allow access, but as *nix systems are meant to be multi user in nature, any one user making a change will affect the whole application. BlitzMax would have to be altered to take this into account by using directories in the user own home directory.<br><br>3) Using debuild can corrupt up a number of files.<br>The best thing is to put the whole BlitzMax directory into a tar.gz and unpack. It really loves fasm....<br><br>Note that I have been toying around with it most of this morning. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I've not gone for the compile as you go route as it would take too much time to test. I'm still faffing with VMs for now. It still needs testing and improving with checks to make sure that it doesn't break the package system. The wrong execution of a command can bugger up a system good style. Then there is the question of gpg keys and adding bits to changes etc.<br><br>As for permissions. The BlitzMax directory is owned by root, but I've done it so that a new blitzmax group is added and this group has rights to the BlitzMax directory. The sudo user who installed the package is automatically added to this group. Note no check yet for users under su. Any other user that needs access should be manually added to this group. As I remember the tmp and cfg directories are the only ones that need general access. Maybe a few alterations to redirect them to a directory created in the current logged in users home directory. Or break the taboo and set the permission on those directories to full for owner, group and others.<br><br>As for modules, well that's the problem.
