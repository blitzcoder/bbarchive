So just stick with 1.48 if you wish to distribute your applications. Companies such as Steam will reject Linux applications that aren't built against Debian 6/7 or a Ubuntu distribution that is based directly from the stable branch of Debian. Or to be more precise they have to be able to run on Debian. If you do want to use 1.50, then Ubuntu 13.04/13.10.<br><div class="quote"> If I were to install a version of Ubuntu (say on external HD) which version should I install? <br></div><br>You don't need to install a complete distribution. You can do what's commonly known as a <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot" target="_blank">chroot</a> (an abbreviation of change root). When the first 64bit distributions came along, there was no 32bit support within them at all. The only way you could get round it without completely messing up the installation was to use a chroot and a clever bit of scripting to run 32bit applications. Somewhere there is an out dated post by me that showed how to do this. Don't try it out as things have changed, and there is a real danger that you mess up the system beyond repair.<br><a href="http://www.monkey-x.com/Community/posts.php?topic=7600#90286" target="_blank">There are tutorials by me over on the MonkeyX site</a>.

My 12.04 may be in need of some updates too (installing now). But regardless of how BlitzMax was built, it wont affect how it *builds*, will it? That will come down to what compilers, libs etc you've got installed.<br><br>Anyway, V1.50 works here on both Ubuntu 12.04 and a shiny new install of Ubuntu 14.04 (very nice!), so I'm not sure what the problem is. I build/test on Ubuntu *only*, so that's definitely the recommended dev platform for using BlitzMax. Which isn't exactly the Linux way, but while I would love to be able to provide mega support for a bunch of distros, that's just not gonna happen. On the other hand, if it's simply a case of installing/fixing something and rebuilding the lot, let me know what to do.<br><br>Re: audio, I strongly recommend using openal on Linux, ie: SetAudioDriver "OpenAL". I might make this the default for linux in the next release.<br><br>This (apparently) means 'openal-soft' these days for most distros, which is much better than the old, laggy openal lib. I've been on the openal mailing list for a while now, and the openal-soft author clearly knows far more about linux audio than I ever will, and openal-soft *should* handle a wide range of different setups and distros.<br><br>It's also possible to ship binaries with a prebuilt openal-soft binary, although I have no idea how necessary this really is. This involves using a 'launcher' script file that mungs LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include 'current dir' or similar, so you can just stick a prebuilt openal.so in the app's main dir. There's also the RPATH=$ORIGIN linker option (which would need to be hacked into bmk) although this effectively hardcodes the lib path into your app, meaning your app will *never* use 'system' openal. Which is possibly not the linux way(?)<br><br>[edit]<br>Ok, reading around a bit it appears the main problem people have with openal is it isn't included with all distros (but then, what is?), in which case your app can either somehow install (or prompt the user to install) openal, or use  LD_LIBRARY_PATH or RPATH to force your app to use a prebuilt, internal version of openal.so.<br>[/edit] <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Ubuntu/Mint are #3 and #4 most used OS worldwide (when cumulating all Windows incarnations as one) - so I assume you reach most of the linux users with PulseAudio. But some of your customers/clients/users/friends then might run into trouble installing another lib. Same for me when it comes to openAL - which has to get manually installed on nearly all distros. This is a no-go for apps you do not compile on your own (open source). So this means: for now you need to use Alsa. And if done properly, you can also use PulseAudio (dynamical linking of libs) like done in FreeAudio. It just needs some fixes (app-end-channelPlaying-Boolean is wrong on Linux) and enhancements (streaming :D).<br><br>OSS is nice to have, but hmm really outdated, JACK is not used by many users except audio enthusiasts (low latency engine).<br><br><br>Benefit of PulseAudio: you can route audio streams over the network - so eg. route your apps sound to another unit in another room to playback that sound.

Using a VM can throw of the results a bit with having to install Guest Additions to get things working.<br><br>The GLIBC versions are different in the Debian stable branch, which is still using EGLIBC 2.13-38+deb7u1, while Ubuntu 12.04 is using EGLIBC 2.15-0ubuntu10.5 (current as the initial 12.04.2 iso image release uses EGLIBC 2.15-0ubuntu10.3 as there was a minor update). There is an up to date version of EGLIBC in the Debian testing branch (I think that's currently 2.17).<br>There are quite a few topics about applications breaking as a result of this EGLIBC issue with Debian. Which is a bit ironic as the minimum requirement for the Steam client is Ubuntu 12.04 and yet they rejected an application because of this GLIBC issue and recommended that the author rebuilt it with Debian Wheezy or Ubuntu lucid 10.04 or another old enough distro.<br><br>As bcc from 1.50 will function on Debian 7 32bit with out a hitch, it is possible to use BlitzMax 1.48 to rebuild the tools for 1.50 and then copy over the new tools to the 1.50 bin directory. You can then rebuild the 1.50 modules and if you wish, rebuild the tools again with the 1.50 modules. The last time I attempted to do this was with Debian 64bit in VM and something wouldn't work correctly. I will see if I can get 1.50 will work correctly on a 64bit version of Debian later.<br><br><div class="quote"> Re: audio, I strongly recommend using openal on Linux, ie: SetAudioDriver "OpenAL". I might make this the default for linux in the next release. <br></div>OpenAL has been know to have issues with Pulse Audio on some distributions with certain sound devices. The end user has to then force OpenAl to use ALSA (echo "drivers = alsa" &gt; ~/.alsoftrc). And as stated earlier, OpenAl is not installed on many systems by default. Likewise, pulseaudio is not installed as default on many distributions and many users will refuse to install either just to get one piece of software to work. There is a topic about audio problems and possible solution <a href="/posts.php?topic=101981" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>I think myself that the Max Audio module should check to see if a preferred sound server is available and running and then dynamically load it's libraries for use and always fall back to using the ALSA drivers if all else fails as the kernel (from 2.5 I think) has support for ALSA drivers as standard. OSS has been depreciated on Linux for some time now.<br><br><div class="quote"> Hmm, so "g++" is another requirement for BlitzMax on Linux (it is _not_ installed on all distros by default). <br></div>The c compiler is not always guaranteed to be installed as default either. If I remember 14 years ago I had to manually install it on Redhat. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

What engines are supported is then just a matter of the "Max audio module" - and having a look at FreeAudio it shows that plugging in "newer engines" is possible and so the module does not have a "dead end".<br><br>@PulseAudio<br>I do not want to start a flame so excuse me in advance :D. I think PulseAudio is the "current state of the art" engine for Linux distros. Most of the Linux users will have it installed. But: yes, as Alsa is the LCD of all engines (highest coverage) this is the one we should have working 100%. Other things are "sugar".<br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But unfortunately it's not that easy, as GLIBC is a core library that requires other core libraries. It becomes a vicious circle as you then find out that in the end you start to have to include other libraries that you wouldn't even have guested would need to be linked against.
