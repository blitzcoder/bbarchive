Unlike you though, I have little time to sift through linux threads on configuration (in this case, the brl forums in search of answers to a simple installation).  I have 14 different tasks going on here 'TaskMaster', 13 of which I get paid to do.  Unlike you I have little time to devote to researching why my 'hobby' dev product isn't working out of the box, so I figured I would make a post in the begininers area in hopes of getting an answer (which I did, thank you very much Jesse).  <br><br>Secondly, to rebut your comment above...  For ANYONE who has EVER configured linux you know fully well that with every major or minor release there are configuration changes by which previous documented workarounds (those who HAVE solved a problem before) are no longer valid.  I did find a post from Mark saying I needed a few dependencies just before I saw Jesse's answer.  But it was for build 132, and before I go installing a bunch of crap that might not work anymore with build 134 I figured I would keep my question open (again, in the beginners area) to see if there were a more updated solution....<br><br>Thirdly, I only want to do a simple console app and (correct me if I am wrong here but) isn't x11 for graphics?  I can understand if I wanted to use the graphics portion of bmax, but I don't, I thought it wouldnt use certain frameworks by default heh......<br><br>Lastly, if it were common knowledge, then it should be in the manual shouldn't it?!?<br><br>So with all that being said, you sir can touch my back side with not one, but both of your lips...... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I know it seems all cut and dry for you guys having run with blitzmax since day 1.  For me, I ran with it on day 1 and then put it away until max 3d (which we all know what happened there lol).

I'm not quite a newbie in Linux (I used to run webservers a few years back), but I am in no way an expert (if someone hasnt done it and posted it in a forum somewhere, I seldom figure it out on my own).  I remember when I first installed SUSE back in the day and tried to get a simple app downloaded and installed on it (at the time it was limewire strangely enough) and after 4 hours of fooling around I just put windows back on the box and let my wife (at the time, now ex) have it :-)<br><br>Then again, it is a bit of a fanboyism that tends to lead to these debates (or harassment).  The die hard Blitz'ers believe that the product is so awesome that anyone who has trouble with it is some kind of dolt.  I'm sure it would surprise them that I find C# easier to understand than Blitzmax (and MSDN documentation as we all know is even harder to navigate)....<br><br>@Czar:  I dont want to turn it into another Win vs Linux vs Mac topic TBH.  I need to make a server console app for a linux box (very basic).  Problem is it's a side project that I am not getting paid for (not work related).  I thought I could do it quick in blizmax (cause I know coding in blitz is pretty quick) however I have come to remember why I choose to leave blitz behind.  Case in point:<br><div class="quote"> ConnectSocket( socket:TSocket,remoteIp,remotePort ) <br></div><br>Is remoteIP an integer?  nope, it doesnt like an ip address in there as an integer...

Well, good luck configuring yourself up some games.<br><br><div class="quote"> Gladly! In return please refrain from contributing anything to this community (checking... oh wait, you already accomplished that, thx for doing it in advance)! Seriously though, if you think that my asking him (in a nice way mind you) to "kiss my arse" as a sexual advance, then by all means let me extend the invitation to you as well! <br></div> I was joking with the 'sexual advance' part... forgive me... an overestimation of your intellect on my part. Not sure I want to place my lips there, but I'm about ready to try it on as a boot. Ohhh it'd be a good boot alright.<br><br><div class="quote"> Thanks for reposting what someone above you posted... Def makes you look like a genius! <br></div> That and the line about mingw was me trying to help you sift through what you needed to know, and didn't. Anyways, your welcome, I know I may seem like a genius from your point of view, but trust me you'll learn something someday.<br><br><div class="quote"> What's this 'ours' crap? I only meant that comment to Taskmaster (but am willing to include you in the recipient list if your so inclined) and, in it's defense (the comment), it wasn't until he blatantly assumed I had all this time to sift through years of forum posts to find something that should probably be in a manual or on the products page somewhere that I chose it.  <br></div>  Ohhh, (stickied I think...) threads are just there for people who have time! Well, I'm glad that your knowledge of Taskmasters free time, and the very winded explanation of your own time, and finally the comparison of the two... wasn't directed to me. I take back my words. I'm glad you don't 'blatantly assume' anything.<br><br>To tell the truth, had I read just your first post, I would have probably helped out as much as I could. After reading your response to (once again not so nice) Taskmaster, I decided that -My- time was only worth what I posted.<br><br><div class="quote"> As for false claims and accusations, feel free to reread the thread. I don't see anywhere I made any false claims or accusations.. Although I don't recall asking for help directly, I didn't in any way say Bmax was broken or bugged. Just because you assumed or took it as such doesn't make it so.<br> <br></div><br>Nope, you blatantly attacked people.<br><br><div class="quote"> Obviously you are missing something, and my guess is that you are missing a bunch of Linux dependencies. There are threads around here that explain everything you need. Many of us have the latest version of BlitzMax running on the latest version of Ubuntu.  <br></div><br><br>TaskMaster addressed your problem right there. You have dependency issues. He told you that the answers are here, and that people do have it working with the latest stuff. He did not step you through what dependencies you needed because he may not know which ones -exactly-. He may not have too much time either, but decided he could send you in the right direction. He didn't even comment on your quadruple post there, and yet you replied calling him a moron, saying his time isn't worth yours, and finally telling him to kiss your arse.<br><br>Finally... <div class="quote"> Gladly! In return please refrain from contributing anything to this community (checking... oh wait, you already accomplished that, thx for doing it in advance)! <br></div><br>Wtf? FYI I contributed a decent amount back when blitzcoder was up, some on codersworkshop, and even a tiny bit on socoder and here. I'm not quite sure why your even commenting on this though? Are you telling me to not help out? Well, I'll tell you this, you have no help from me to worry about from here on, k? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

My saying that you were accusing BlitzMax of having bugs is an attack on you???  I do not see how you took that as an attack.  I misunderstood what you typed, as others did, and you took my comment as an attack, which it wasn't.  So, maybe we are both at fault.  <br><br>But my accusing you of saying BlitzMax was buggy is a far cry from being an attack, let alone calling you a moron.<br><br>Seems to me, you might have some anger management issues :)<br><br>Anyway, yes, I grabbed a VMWare VM of OSX off of the Net and installed BlitzMax on it.
