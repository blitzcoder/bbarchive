All tried projects work perfectly in both Windows and MacOS X, so it shouldn't be the code, I think. Is it something wrong in Blitzmax or is VirtualBox simply not able to run BlitzMax projects (though I could run a few Windows builds perfectly in Virtual Box (in Windows XP and it was terrible slow, but they worked), but of course Windows!=Linux so that may not say much. I didn't expect them to run fast or anything, for me it was just a matter if they work at all.<br><br>Does anybody else have experiences with running BlitzMax apps in Linux in Virtual Box?

In one project of mine I got a proper error message on that as 3D not being supported in my VM (I need to sort out how Virtual Box handles that part).<br><br>The first project I tried is actually neither. That was an old P2000T program my dad once coded long ago, that I recreated in BlitzMax (when I was bored) and it's entirely based on MaxGUI, no references made to OpenGL at all. As that was only a program made when I was bored I may release the source soon so that we might get an idea where the problem lies. I have the feeling that the unloading might be doing the evil here as that program shows a little information first (for which a separate Window was created) when the actual program starts I believe that Window was completely unloaded. Of course I can only speculate.<br><br><div class="quote"> One thing I noticed was sometimes it caused by a dodgy filename path or something like that linux like mac osx is case sensitive for filenames <br></div><br>Actually the programs were all on a USB harddrive that was called with the Shared Files feature VirtualBox provides. As it was a FAT partition even Linux drops the Case Sensitive part on that, but of course, one can never be sure that isn't the real problem. I should assume though that MaxIDE forms the way to call bmk and the compiled program well, but who is me... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Especially not with FAT formatted devices (as FAT is not case sensitive) but I even tried it on my internal Mac Hard drive and I could just use lower and upper case randomly. I know Linux (or at least Ubuntu) is case sensitive, but (as far as I experienced so far) not on my shared Virtual Box folders.<br><br>But as said before, I take it MaxIDE calls the created exes (or whatever you call them in Linux) correctly and the project I want to show so you can try out what my cause this does not call for any external files once it's compiled, so that makes me doubt case sensitivity is the cause of the evil here, but I never eliminate an option before I made sure :)<br><br>I will try to make a debug build to see if the error persists there as "Segmentation fault" or if I get an actual error message. Of course it may be possible that my Linux version of BMax is a newer version than the Mac and Windows one, I want to make sure that that doesn't matter at all.<br><br>I'll make a double check on the read-only setting. I'm pretty sure it's read-write, but I want to make sure I can safely eliminate that possibility.<br><br>Ok, thanks a lot, with this information I'll try again, if this is still no good, I may post the source of my "I am bored" project. I got a drop-box account. It is possible to put stuff on there in a public folder without having to give away my password wasn't it?
