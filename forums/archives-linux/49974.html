If you have a recent ATI card (8500 or better) you will have to download the Linux installer from ATI's driver website.  If you have an NVidia card you can download an installer through YOU, although I haven't tried this myself.

So the issues were missing drivers, meaning that the sound and NIC supports were lost with the boards and I was forced into adding cards that were supported.  This was several years ago, and I just simply went trying different distros, until I landed into Linspire.  I am not a "dumb" user with linux, just a lazy one.<br><br>Recently, this has started to change the more I develop within Linux OS.  I have found several disadvantages to Linspire (they messed with a LOT to make it this "stupidified" and cloned Windows theme) <br><br>CNR *DOES* allow to to see what's being installed, but as or after it installs the package(s).  And its easy enough to remove them too.  I can look through each "package" and see all the DEB files it needed to install.  What bites is that you CAN NOT know what ALL the required DEB files are.  I have no way of determining what belongs with what unless it needed to install a *missing* deb.<br><br>As I progress with Linspire, especially this sound thing we've been working on, the less I like it.  Its still rock solid stable, and runs and does everything as required, but its the "Where do I" and "How can I" type questions for more sophisticated things that it doesn't provide.  I mean just this:  It should have taken me minutes to get the sound support rolling for BlitzMax, but it has turned into days.<br><br>This reminds me of the stuff MS did with .NET coming from Studio 6.  The Framework changed so much that it was a NEW language in a sense.  Things that were in places forever, sudennly moved and are callled something else.  Coding simple stuff took hours and days longer just because they wanted to change the development environment.  My point is not to complain about MS stuff, just as a comparison to Linspire.  <br><br>I am determined to figure out this sound issue.<br><br>I plan on looking into SuSE again.  It sounds like much positive progress has been placed into the development of it.  It is one of my favorite Distros. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
