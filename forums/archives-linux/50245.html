I assume NO <br>responsibility for any damamges done following these instructions.<br><br><br>General Requirements<br>========================================<br>1) Linspire 5.0<br>   (possibly 4.5/4.0 - untested)<br><br>2) Click and Run subsription (CNR)<br>   There are different packages available depending on your needs, but the <br>cheapest one will get you what you need for this installation process.<br><br>3) BlitzMAX registered copy :-)<br><br><br>Preparation Instructions<br>========================================<br>Here's where the fun begins...<br><br>I assume you have already passed all the general requirements, and Linspire <br>is installed on your PC.<br><br>You have TWO options to get these packages:<br><br>A) You can simply search for "BlitzMax Required Packages" <br>under "Aisles" -&gt; "Public Aisles" and the list is there as follows. <br>Simply click SELECT ALL and then click CNR SELECTED.  <br>This will be all you need to do for getting the required packages!  <br>Skip down to step #6 and proceed with the instructions from there on.<br><br>-OR-<br><br>B) Do it manually in CNR and find them all yourself:<br><br>First, I am going to simply list all the packages you will need for this to <br>work.  Just use the Search in CNR to find them:<br><br>1) X11 Development Library<br>   (this one gives 21 libraries, of which only a handful are prolly only <br>needed - this is the stable release 6.8.1, but actually works fine for <br>BlitzMAX to operate)<br><br>2) xspecs<br>   (this one is optional, but it completes the first one)<br><br>3) GNU C<br>   (this will give the gcc 3.3 package)<br><br>4) GNU C++<br>   (this will give the g++ 3.3 package and libstdc++ 5-3.3)<br><br>5) libsdl1.2-dev<br>   (this provides the sound and mesa gl/glu dev libraries)<br><br>6) Open a Konsole window<br>   (Terminal Window, found in the Launch Menu -&gt; Run Programs -&gt; Utilities <br>-&gt; Terminal Window (Konsole))<br><br>7) Type in the following (you can copy and paste it too)<br><br>   su root  [press enter]<br><br>   (enter your root password, then press enter)<br><br>8) Enter the following and wait for the prompt after each enter press:<br><br>   cd /usr/X11R6/lib  [press enter]<br><br>   ld --whole-archive -shared -o libXxf86vm.so libXxf86vm.a  [press enter]<br><br>   ln -s libXxf86vm.so libXxf86vm.so.1  [press enter]<br><br>   ldconfig  [press enter]<br><br>   exit  [press enter]<br><br>   exit  [press enter]<br><br><br>After installing ALL the packages, it is now time to get sound working!<br><br><br>Sound configuration<br>========================================<br>First, I would like to take this time to acknowledge Craig Kiesau for<br>his time and energy in getting this to work with me.  Thanks Craig!<br><br>Since Linspire uses JACK (Jack Audio Connection Kit) for the sound server,<br>we are going to preserve this setting (since Linspire's CNR programs are<br>designed to use JACK)<br><br>Linspire has a plethora of different Sound Servers and as such, sound systems<br>which by default are available for different programs to access.<br><br>BlitzMax uses OSS (but emulated by ALSA), and so we're going to establish a Plugin for the JACK system<br>which redirects ALSA sound through JACK.<br><br>1) Create the file: alsa.conf (Linspire DOES NOT have this file. <br>I created mine in /home/dan)<br><br>2) Use the below to write the file.  <br>   (I used Text Editor, but ANY text editing utility will work fine)<br><br>     pcm.jackplug {<br>            type plug<br>            slave { pcm "jack" }<br>     }<br><br>     pcm.jack {<br>            type jack<br>            playback_ports {<br>                    0 alsa_pcm:playback_1<br>                    1 alsa_pcm:playback_2<br>            }<br>            capture_ports {<br>                    0 alsa_pcm:capture_1<br>                    1 alsa_pcm:capture_2<br>            }<br>     }<br><br>     pcm.!default {<br>            type plug<br>            slave.pcm "jackplug"<br>     }<br> <br>3) Open Konsole (Terminal Window)<br>   (Terminal Window, found in the Launch Menu -&gt; Run Programs -&gt; Utilities <br>-&gt; Terminal Window (Konsole))<br><br>   su root [press enter]<br><br>   Supply root password and press enter<br><br>4) enter in: (I am assuming that you created the alsa.conf in /home/[username]<br>   (my case /home/dan)... if not use the location where you put it.<br><br>	cp alsa.conf /etc/alsa.conf<br><br>5) Close Konsole (Terminal Window)<br><br>6) Open Control Center <br>   (Launch -&gt; Settings -&gt; Control Center)<br><br>7) Select Sound Server<br><br>8) Change the Sound Buffer down to 1 second <br>   (I believe any of the 1 second settings will do, <br>I used the last 1 second setting, but did not try the others)<br><br>9) Apply changes<br><br>10) Close Control Center<br><br>Great!  Sound is setup, and the required packages are installed.  <br>Let's get BlitzMax installed!<br><br><br>BlitzMAX Setup Installation<br>========================================<br>1) Download the latest BlitzMAX Setup (they are appropriately label as such: <br>Update or Setup)<br><br>   Make sure you place the ark file somewhere you will be able to locate it <br>easily later, such as "My Documents"  I created a folder called "My <br>Downloads" and stored it there.<br><br>   Ark can be a bit of a beast, just do a "Save As" from the "File" menu, <br>and place it where you want it<br><br>2) Locate the Setup file, right click on it, and select "Ark"<br><br>3) Select Edit -&gt; "Select All"<br><br>4) Select Action -&gt; "Extract"<br><br>5) Decide where to put these files and folders.  I used the /home/dan <br>directory, and BlitzMax109 was born<br><br>6) Locate and open the BlitzMax109 (Setup) folder<br><br>7) Execute BlitzMax by double-clicking the icon.<br><br>8) If everything was successful, BlitzMax is loaded with the Help screen up <br>;)<br>   CONGRATS!  But don't play just yet... we STILL have work to do!!!<br><br>9) With BlitzMAX running, Locate and select the Menu "Program" -&gt; "Rebuild <br>All Modules"<br>   Please be patient here.  It does take a few minutes or so to recompile <br>all the modules that make BlitzMAX operate.<br><br>10) Hopefully, you reached the "Process Complete" without an error.<br>    (Otherwise, you'll be back in the forums looking for help!!)<br><br>11) NOW YOU CAN PLAY!<br><br>    To the right, you will see "+ Help"<br><br>    Click the "+" to expand the menu<br><br>    Click on "Samples"<br><br>    Select "RockOut"<br><br>    Select Menu "Program" -&gt; "Build and Run"<br><br>    If EVERYTHING is well and good, you should see the screen go blank and <br>the game begins.<br><br>    CONGRADULATIONS!!!  You have successfully setup Linspire to work with <br>BlitzMAX!!! :-)<br><br><br>BlitzMAX Update Installation<br>========================================<br>1) Download the latest BlitzMAX Update (they are appropriately label as <br>such: Update or Setup)<br>   Make sure you place the ark file somewhere you will be able to locate it <br>easily later, such as "My Documents"  I created a folder called "My <br>Downloads" and stored it there.<br><br>   Ark can be a bit of a beast, just do a "Save As" from the "File" menu, <br>and place it where you want it<br><br>2) Locate the Setup file, right click on it, and select "Ark"<br><br>3) Select Edit -&gt; "Select All"<br><br>4) Select Action -&gt; "Extract"<br><br>5) Decide where to put these files and folders.  I used the /home/dan <br>directory, and BlitzMax110 was born<br><br>6) Locate and open the BlitzMax110 folder (Or what the Update folder is <br>currently called)<br><br>7) Copy everything in this folder (don't copy the BlitzMax110 (or Update) <br>folder itself though)<br><br>8) Paste the contents OVER the BlitzMax109 (Setup) folder.<br>   You may recieve a message that asks if you'd like to skip copying an <br>empty folder "/svn", select "Auto-Skip"<br><br>   In a few moments, this process completes<br><br>9) Re-open the BlitzMax109 (Setup) folder, executing "BlitzMax"<br><br>10) If you were asked to Syncronize Modules, select "Yes"; otherwise Select <br>the Menu "Program" -&gt; "Syncronize Modules..."<br><br>    You will be asked for your Blitz user account name, password, and IF you <br>have a Proxy in which you must go through, it would be entered here.<br><br>11) Patience is a virtue.<br>    In a moment or two (depending upon the speed of your internet <br>connection, I am cruising along at ~110k/sec), you will see the server being <br>contacted.<br>    Then a few moments later, files begin to flow down the screen.<br>    Eventually, you will see "Process complete"<br><br>12) Once this is complete, select Menu "Program" -&gt; "Build Modules"<br>    Again, be patient.<br>    Hopefully you will get to the "Process Complete" without a hitch :-)<br><br>13) NOW YOU CAN PLAY!<br><br>    To the right, you will see "+ Help"<br><br>    Click the "+" to expand the menu<br><br>    Click on "Samples"<br><br>    Select "RockOut"<br><br>    Select Menu "Program" -&gt; "Build and Run"<br><br>    If EVERYTHING is well and good, you should see the screen go blank <br>and the game begins.<br><br>    CONGRADULATIONS!!!  You have successfully updated BlitzMAX!!! :-)<br>    <br><br>Issues and Fixes<br>========================================<br>From time to time, things seem to go wrong under Linspire.<br>Sad, but true.  Here, I will list known issues with thier resolutions.<br><br>1) I did ALL the sound steps, but it still doesn't work?!<br><br>   Don't panic!  There are issues with JACK and ALSA, and for some <br>   reason JACK ALWAYS wins in Linspire 5.0.  I found an effective fix for this:<br>   <br>   A) Open a Terminal Window (Konsole)<br>   B) killall artsd [press enter]<br>   C) killall jackd [press enter]<br>   D) jackd -d alsa [press enter]<br>      At this point it appears that it hangs up, just close the window<br>      <br>      If you got an error about jackd not being able to load b/c the driver is in use,<br>      try it over A) - D)<br>      <br>   Try launching any game in BlitzMax and see if the sound works.  <br>   You may have to shut down BlitzMax and try again. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
