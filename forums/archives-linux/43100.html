Fat 16 too. NTFS..I think now some distro can read, not sure though. Safes way for me has allways been fat32. I used to deal my hd partition files from my both installed linux partitions (one can't have ever enough...XD) <br><br>So let's try to clarify.. Antony, you have a problem of cdr not reading new cds, surely as your cdr reader is too old to read a new format, of those saved lately. You seen to have the CDs in the HD, and what u wanna do is siomply burn som CDs with the distro, to make the bootable install (if boot wouldn't work, check bios settings(cdr boot))<br><br>besides u can borrow anyone's mandrake's or redhat cds, u can even purchase em burned dirty cheap from many vendors.<br><br>BTW, is common that GRUNT "nice" matter of XP not recognizing old peripherals...been called many times to homes of neighbours whose real problem was this. <br><br>Look, the ideal thing is having a win98, winxp, and any linux distro, together in a pc, if the HD is big.  I have done it under demand of users having the 3 oses and wanted to have them all at a time in same pc.<br>is a bit complex, but can be done if done in good order.<br><br>Yet though the xp living together withg a linux is NOT easy. the only ways I know with is the way I prefer to have my boot handled..with an extra boot tool ,the free ones Ranish partition manager, and able to handle xp + linux, bootpa2.5, and XOSL. <br><br>Your problem of cdr burner, if totally no way to fix that with firmware or new drivers, u could make a deal good for: old peripherals, as u'll have more no good for xp, old apps no good for xp, tetxing ur games and libraries also in a w98. So u install a minimal w98, forcing ur boot manager  (one of those I mention now) to allow w98, wxp or linux boot. Total power that way.Not only is possible, I have installed in several persons machines, also at jobs, etc.<br>Well, at jobs, mainly an NT4, w98, red hat. Worked as charm. Of course is more work to maintain 3 oses, but don't u love it.. ;)<br><br>Ranish (this one would restore any w98,wnt, lnux install..beware, problem with xp. If wanna have an xp, use the others) <br><a href="http://www.ranish.com/part/" target="_blank">http://www.ranish.com/part/</a><br><br>"BootPart is an easy tool for adding additional partitions to the Windows NT multi boot menu (for example, add the OS/2 boot manager or a Linux partition).<br>Bootpart 2.50 is compatible with Windows NT, Windows 2000 and Windows XP."<br><br><a href="http://www.winimage.com/bootpart.htm" target="_blank">http://www.winimage.com/bootpart.htm</a><br>Go for it.Now. :)<br><br>REMEMBER: "Bootpart 2.50 in English, with LBA support". <br>THAT version.<br><br>XOSL Is not a ranish project. I think Ranish host it as XOSL was left without hosting, only, and seems ranish like also other products. Of course, both are free.<br><a href="http://www.ranish.com/part/xosl.htm" target="_blank">http://www.ranish.com/part/xosl.htm</a><br><br>BTW, for actually creating 2 PRIMARY partitions(fdisk will only allow creating one primeary and an extended...good to go for an w98 and an xp. But u want also a Linux.), the best way to go is the comercial Partition Magic. if you dont' have it you can let the OSes install care for that. There's a free partition resizer quite easy to handle. Indeed, there's also fips, included in Linux distro's, in certain cd folder. <br><br>I just tend to recommend to make 3 primaries, one small, like bellow 8 gigs for w98, second for linux, no smaller than 3 gigs, preferrably a bit bigger,  third for XP. But XP boot will install in C: !! Wether u set the install partition in an extended E: it does not matter.  The boot files will be in C: (in this config, the w98 patition) .XP will detect perfectly w98 (so that's the order to install) but not linux (guess WHY!)<br><br>So, seems Bootpa 2.5 will allow adding the linux entry into xp loading menu.Which probably is the best bet.<br><br>So, the order could be:<br><br>-make an 8 gigs partition (leave rest as empty space not (no formated, non partitioned)) install w98, install xp(tell it to use the un partitioned blank space(this is NOT the FREE space in the already existing 8gb partition!)) . Yet though, I'd rather prefer to use partition magic or any of the free ones, to generate a blank new primary partition, and then, use xp install and tell it please install there. I rater prefer that. I can use the primary later on for other matter. XP is installed, and adds the entry of old w98 in its boot menu. Now: install linux or first install in mbr (master boot record, something u do to the HD so to put there a multiOS boot load) the bootpa thing. not sure as have not used it yet. read the bootpa help or docs, previously to do the linux install. Supposedly it adds the linux entry to xp boot menu, so ready to go.<br><br>Oh, if u go the way i tell u, but wanna keep some data in HD for save, and as u say, ur cd burner wont work in xp (serious problem) , the first tool to use then is partition magic or similar, to create an extended or primary partition (remember u only can create 4 primaries) where u can put the data. That one must be different to any of the ones u'll use for installing OSes, as u'll destroy the data at install.So, there u could put the Linux cd install u have now in hd, +data to be saved later on in Cds. Once u install anew w98 (it'll kill XP boot, surelly, so while this can be done safely without killing xp, is too complex to explain, let's say u'r already agreing to destroy xp ;) ) u'll be able to install ur cd burner working again.Save the cds, save backp personal data. Install then XP in unpartitioned space as told u, resize the new partition to again leave empty unpartitioned space (a breeze using partition magic, even the old crappy 6.0 DOS version) and read doc of bootpa 2.5 with LFB support, before installing a linux.u should end up with a system that has w98, xp, linux in one HD. I've done it at homes that had 20 gigs...and with w98,NT4,linux in computers with only 4 Gigs. hechk, I remember installing at computer career student friend of mine (lol, the gfx guy helping the coder) installing a suse 6.4 in 300 MB. No kde, no gnome, no nothing...XD But he could use what he wanted for some long time.<br><br>is no easy task, u needda actually learn it, while keep being a total idiot like me. ;) Linux worth it, imho.<br><br>there are other manual ways to make it though, but let's leave them out... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Is only a page of very important info.<br><br>Of course, some thousands times easier ways are installing linux in other PC. ;) Indeed, is frankly easy to have ur other pc installed a new w98, clean and safely, so u leave your developing machine intact (u gotta explain me how doing the great project ur making u don't have a cd burning or back copy system... :o ) and have the other then install linux. I guess u want the machine for developing for linux and testing thelinux versions. Well, in ur actual situation, this is more safe, as there are many points u can wreck it all, while, knowing the stuff very well, tehre's no risk, ie: I would do it all in my main pc.(I have had up to 4 OSse loaded long ago, when installs were less dumb proof, red hat 4.0...oh, in those times,u could install with vram floppy disks..bootdisk..tehn was a bit complex, but sure now is easier) But u can have that otehr machine, instal w98, and then put a linux. Linux does recoginze perfectly w98 and will just add the entry to lilo or -imho better- Grub. Anyway, I often killed lilo or grub for ranish partition boot, as I could handle all bits of multi boot from ms-dos, where I have some more control than with linux command line.<br><br>I'm no total expert, but can do th ecomplex root safe. Just i remember I killed data often till knowing what I know now.<br><br>So, I'd recommend this second route.
