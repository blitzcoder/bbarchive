You'll get used to it eventually :P<br><br>I am figuring it out not by studying that page, but by just using the thing and toying with different programs on my computer. It eventually becomes natural where everything is, and it starts to make a lot more sense than having a single "applications folder", but it definitely takes a lot of unlearning.<br><br>Linux distributions (particularly Debian-based ones) can get away with this madness thanks to Packages, which boil down to a centralized system that keeps track of every piece of data installed on the system. A debian package is often mistaken as an installer, but it really is not; it's just a really cleverly made archive that can be used <i>by</i> an installer program (usually that comes with the distribution, such as dpkg with Ubuntu) to put all those files that make up a program in the right places. The package, as well as having all of its contents, has a description, a name, and many other handy variables for package management.<br><br>Any package management solution that supports that kind of package can install it, and when this happens it gets added to a database. That entry in the database reflects the package's installed files and other handy information. In this way, the package (and thus its installed files) is removed not by deleting from the applications folder (since there isn't one!), but by uninstalling the package via a utility like aptitude. Even though its contents are spanned all over the file hierarchy (possibly even on different partitions, hard drives or network locations!), they are all cleared out with a single simple operation.<br><br>Oh, and this is completely worth it, by the way. Since all these files can be tied to single packages, neat things happen. For example, one day my file system ended up with a bit of corruption that was detected by fschk. While another system would have just told me "You're disk is corrupted! Haha! Too bad!", this went a lot further. When I next ran Aptitude, it saw that an area of the file system had been reported as damaged and pointed out to me that it was in the realm of a package I'd installed. It offered to reinstall the files, and all was well :)<br><br>Having said all that, you won't need to know a whole lot of these for most uses. /usr tends to have everything one needs if it's the type of app that isn't expecting to be given extra tweaking by administrators. (For example, web servers, ssh and samba put lots of stuff in /var).<br>Keep in mind that per-user settings should <i>always</i> be put in the user's home folder. Unfortunately, there is no standard structure in the home folder, so app data just goes in there amongst all the user's things. Give it a name starting with a dot (eg: .myapp) and you will be fine. Fail to do this, though, and... you will regret it in penguin Hell.<br><br>Another thing that sort of fits in with the central applications folder idea is the .desktop entry standard. Unfortunately, there is more than one place that these go, but the idea is quite simple: A file contains a bunch of keys and values that describe an application. This has methods to run the program, a description, a name, MIME types, and other such fun details. These .desktop files are, in certain cases, used to generate the main menu. They are also used for panel applets, screensaver themes, "special" directories... all sorts of magic!<br>Thanks to these, you can theoretically put your main executable anywhere and have the .desktop files point to that. In a few cases, even, that makes sense! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
