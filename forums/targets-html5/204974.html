Slenkar his argument isn't different than any website using AJAX to post forums posts. There is nothing different than any (AJAX) webpage.<br><br>- no separation of logic<br><br>Why? You can make an MVC in Monkey; with the node.js target it seems very doable both frontend and backend. The eventually compiled version won't have separation but who cares about that?<br><br>- no styling<br><br>Why? You can build anything; you can even build games in Monkey, so you can style/theme anything you want. It might be more work, but what's the issue here? <br><br>- embedded fonts<br><br>This is a problem?<br><br>- slow build cycle<br><br>Why? If you have your dev pipeline set up it might be faster or slower than 'normal' pages; not sure why this is different? For me Monkey is not slower than most other stuff. We are desperately missing a REPL / interpreter indeed.  Someone should make that. Besides that, I catch a lot of potential bugs with the types in monkey which go unnoticed until (much) later with normal JS. <br><br>- needs a compile for every change<br><br>Indeed; that's an issue. On the other hand, Monkey has types which makes errors easier to catch during compile than pure HTML5 making it, for me, usually as fast or faster than JS even including compiles. Also, a lot of people are not writing pure html/css/js anymore but sass, coffeescript and such; those need compile cycles too. <br><br>- no clear api to communicate with<br><br>You can make that API or model after an existing API of some existing library. There are examples in Haxe of this; some people even implemented a subset of CSS on top of a Haxe gui lib. <br><br>- you cannot use the &gt;1000.000(!) JavaScript libs on Github. without overly complex hacks<br><br>Depends what you are doing. There are a quazillion canvas libs which can all be quite easily used. And you can mix with DOM but then you're not doing anymore what you asked. <br><br>- if you get stuck on some problem, there is only a very small community that isn't build around 'making websites' <br><br>That's true.<br><br>What I think is a huge problem; SEO. When you write websites with Canvas (which is what you are asking, right?) Google cannot read the text you have in the site and thus it cannot index it. <br><br>Hence it would make a lot more sense, like Corona does (but not for HTML), to add a native controls library for the frontend which, in html5, translates to normal html tags with css (in some encapsulation with Monkey, overridable with normal css if you really have to. yuck css). And for the backend a Monkey API on top of node &amp; PHP (so you can use it on any server). <br><br>Then you have the best of both worlds and transparent at that. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

A lot of your content is going to be buried inside the canvas element in your code, as images, whereas with a normally marked up html website, all that text and semantic structure can be indexed. Flash swfs have a similar problem. I think your best bet would be to use Monkey as an enhancement to a html+css website, as opposed to a replacement.
