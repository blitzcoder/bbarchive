There was some confusion with their process of becoming a dev. Now the way I understand it is that you pay for a publisher licence. I guess this is when you're happy with your game and are ready to sell. That makes a lot more sense and should alienate less indies IMO. <br><br>Sorry for any confusion caused, but my questions still stand to @bt garner and others that are trying to dev for the Vita using Monkey. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

On a very high note, I just wanted to say that without having to do too much work, I've got my game running perfectly in the PSM simulator. Saying that, the Xbox360 usb controller I have connected to my PC has the buttons mapped all wrong. I have checked the Monkey documentation and it appears to be right, so I think it's likely the Xbox controller/Simulator combo that's weird. I'm dying to test this on my real Vita, but not sure how to make Monkey do a compile and run it on the Vita instead of the simulator. The PSM studio seems to only have the simulator under teh drop-down for targets, so I guess once you've paid the publisher licence, that will then link up your connected Vita too?<br><br>Just to clarify, it seems to me you have to pay the Publishers fee to test on real hardware anyway. I've just applied for the publisher's licence, so will see how it goes from there, but TBH, so far, so good. I may well have not bothered with the Vita if Monkey didn't make it as easy as it's been now. Well done Mr Sibly. You did a fine job. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I had trouble in the Publishing Utility to generate a key name and an app key at first as I wasn't sure exactly what I needed to fill in, but after a few tries I got it working.<br>The only problem I am finding now is that when you do a Launch in Mollusk, ie a build and run, it launches the simulator instead of pushing it to the Vita itself. I find that the only way I can get it to work is to open the Monkey solution in PSM studio, then ensure the Vita is chosen in the drop-down, before hitting Run/Debug. It's a bit of a pain, so I was hoping someone could shed some light on where I could possibly change the PSM build solution within Monkey to set the drop-down to the Vita, if that's even possible? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In addition, the Select button, supposedly JOY_BACK, doesn't trigger anywhere. I'm ok with it as I can work around it, but I just thought I'd make others aware of these issues.<br>The rest of the buttons and controls work wonderfully. It's also great to see a Monkey game on the vita screen :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
