If they could we wouldn't perceive 13 FPS as motion. Imagine you see at the equivalent of 60 FPS and what you were watching was 15 FPS. You would see the object stop for 4 frames of your eyes and then move again and pause, move again, pause, etc. We see smooth motion because our eyes can not in fact see at that rate. 13 FPS is still blazing fast. That's 77 ms between frames which is correct considering it takes about that much time for our brains to transform that information into what we see. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That seems to coincide with the majority of people considering 60hz to be "close enough" to what they see IRL to merge completely imperceptibly, rather than 'strobe' (and have our brain fill in the gaps), while a small minority of people seem to prefer a higher hz rate than that because they are able to notice the effect.

It's irritating to my eyes. I've never seen LEDs do that.<br><br>----<br>More to the point though, regardless of what I wrote about eyes, I still think above 60 FPS is absurd. In fact, more often than not I still run things in 30 FPS. It all looks smooth to me. I can't imagine there being a huge need to be any faster, especially on mobile devices as they currently are.<br><br>Also, smilertoo, I will assume that you haven't done much research on the PS Vita and how it handles things under it's VM. I'll tell you straight up that the processor speed is down-clocked and memory is constrained. You can increase it a bit manually, but it does not yield a whole lot of extra space. The PS Vita very much relies on using threaded code to get your games running the way you want them to. As Monkey can not yet, or maybe ever, take advantage of this, it's likely all code running on the system will never be as fast as you want it to be. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
