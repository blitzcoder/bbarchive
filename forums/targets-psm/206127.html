Sometimes the PSM IDE hangs, sometimes I get the "Deploying application to device" message at the bottom, but it's not actually doing anything (I have the Vita plugged in via USB and the PSM dev app open) and sometimes when the app appears to install, I just briefly get a blank screen and no error message when I try to run it.<br><br>I'm not sure how many of you are using the PSM target but is there a knack to deploying onto and running Monkey games on the Vita? I am struggling some what!<br><br>Ta! :D <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Of course that would've been the sensible thing to do, but naturally I went straight to a game I've already half made. As stated, it did actually run (Perling) but at the same time Ninjah didn't.<br><br>I too found out that changing the name of the project wasn't a good idea ;)<br><br>It just seems to me that the problem isn't necessarily always the game and more the process of getting it on to the Vita.<br><br>Either way, I will do some Hello World tests to try and establish what's causing Ninjah not to run.<br><br>Ta :D <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That's a big one, cause while it will work, it gets weird. Next, ensure that your machine is awake. When it goes to sleep and you try to deploy, sometimes the PSV will cause the IDE to hang/lock up. Lastly, make sure your key is in the right folder and that if you delete your build folder, that you put it back.<br><br>Those are the only tips I can give, cause that's what I do and I haven't had any problems whatsoever.<br><br>@ilovepixel As to the project renaming, I've renamed several projects with no problems. They'll all on my PSV simultaneously and can be updated any time. Not sure what you're doing wrong. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I restarted the Vita and my PC and it starts working again, so something is going on somewhere!<br><br>I didn't actually follow a guide for Vita deployment word for word, so I am going to have to stop being an impatient fool and do that. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Cause it almost sounds like the IRQ gets hung up because of insufficient power while trying to accomplish its task. Although I may be overthinking what the problem is greatly.<br><br>And yeah, definitely read the deployment guide. The PSV uses a very foreign-to-me deployment system. Maybe that's because I haven't done anything other than PC deployment up until now.<br><br>If I recall correctly, when I first set it up, I had to generate a key for the PSV itself and then one for every game. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
