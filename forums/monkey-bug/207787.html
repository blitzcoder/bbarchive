This should be a drop-in replacement pretty much, and would make it a lot easier on developers of the desktop version since we wouldn't have to include the redistribution installer anymore (furthermore, it seems like finding it online's gonna be difficult from here on out anyway).  <a href="http://www.openal-soft.org/" target="_blank">http://www.openal-soft.org/</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The license is LGPL. This basically means that if you statically link to this library it becomes a derived work so then you will also have to make at least your compiled object file available on request to anyone who wants to compile against any other version of that library. Which is a bugger if you want to sell you creation as free loader Joe Bloggs can demand a copy under the terms of the LGPL license. The best solution here is to either dynamically link to the library or get in touch with the copyright holder and get written permission if you wish to statically link to a LGPL code for commercial purposes.<br><br>You should have a look at <a href="http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview/id/439136.html" target="_blank">http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview/id/439136.html</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Someone who is completely new to programming may get the wrong impression and think that it is OK to statically link a library and then fall foul of the law. It would be worth it for people to look into some of the lawsuit cases that the Free Software Foundation have brought against companies/individuals the biggest being against Cisco Systems.<br><br>And one more thing for anyone reading this. If you sign up to any developer program you must read the License Agreement very, very carefully. It should be also noted that if you release a application under the GPL or port over a GPL application to a Apple device, it will be rejected/removed as iTunes Store Terms of Service, which is incompatible with the GPL. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Only GLFW gets built into an application as it's licensed under the zlib/libpng license <a href="http://www.glfw.org/license.html." target="_blank">http://www.glfw.org/license.html.</a> When using any library you should read the license and what it allows.If I read the licenses correctly, any thing that's linked statically or dynamically to GPL libraries/code becomes GPL so your source code must also be released as GPL. Any thing that's statically linked to LGPL libraries/code, either has to be released as LGPL or at leased the compiled object has to be made available without cost or restrictions. You don't have to release source code when statically-linking to LGPL. Dynamically linking to LGPL means you can distribute you application as you see fit. The only down side is that the end-user has to have that library available on their system. Any LGPL library that you distribute along with your application has to have it's license notice supplied and it's source code made readily available or a place where the source code can be acquired. If you have modified any LGPL library to work with your program then you are required to release that modified source code. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

OpenAL Soft distributes the source, and we can still dynamically link to the dll, but also be able to include it with the installation now instead of having to rely on the OpenAL installer, since LGPL is less restrictive than the previous licensing agreement.  Still a win in my book, even if static linking is not possible for closed-source applications. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
