To begin with, this isn't a logical problem with my code, the compiler's just reporting a bug that isn't there. I imagine this happens with the latest version as well (Which I should probably update to).<br><br>So, is this just an annoying limitation of Monkey, or is it an actual bug? I don't see why removing the generic element should make it work, unless it's a bug. If I can't do this by design, that means Monkey is literally telling me that I can't reuse code without suffering extra overhead and increased code complexity. I don't want interfaces doing the job of a generic class.<br><br>It's not like 'Y' is inheriting itself in some way, so why does the compiler throw an error?<br><br><b>EDIT: I have fixed my own code, but this is still more of a principle problem, than an actual issue with my code.

Your situation is one of the possible downsides to not being able to do this. The fact is, a dynamic cast is horribly inefficient compared to a virtual call, or better yet, no extra overhead on runtime if generics/templates were used for actual types. Some of my own projects use generic class hierarchies, and I can see where this behavior could become an issue later down the road. I guess there's always interfaces, even if they are slightly slower. On the bright side, this means my code is even more reusable.<br><br>By the way, did we even get a proper ruling on generic interfaces? I think they're great, but doesn't the official documentation still consider them unsupported?

I think if interfaces are making it slower, its probably down to usage rather than target implementation.  Refactoring large loops to perform casts outside would alleviate this.

That being said, virtual method calls via virtual multiple inheritance isn't usually much worse. Virtual calls aren't really costly these days, but when they aren't necessary, I like to reduce them. Luckily in other cases, most normal methods don't see any overhead from virtual calls. Monkey's actually pretty good about only compiling what's used. This means I don't have to worry about virtual overhead all the time, but I do in class hierarchies. Dynamic casts require compiler-specific checks against the RTTI for the object. This is a lot more overhead than what modern CPUs could do with a simple check against a table, and calling the right method. These days, branch prediction makes the overhead from virtual methods basically non-existent after a while. Of course, this is less useful when you have a lot of virtual methods in a hierarchy, because the branch predictor wouldn't be dealing with a single function pointer.<br><br>But back on topic, the compiler's tests for "cyclic" inheritance really should be more sophisticated. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In other words, 'List&lt;Car&gt;' does not extend 'List&lt;Vehicle&gt;'. In most cases, you can just get around this using the code you posted. But, what Samah was getting at was using the compiler to effectively make a method or function generic. His idea was to do this by stating that the type of 'List' must at least inherit the type specified. This means that you could pass any list that at least has the type set as the minimum. The only way around this right now is to use interfaces, which can cause unneeded overhead. The thing is, in Monkey you can't simply write generic methods and/or functions, they have to be inside a generic class. This also means 'trans' doesn't have much for this at the moment.<br><br>Interestingly enough, you can technically do this:<br><textarea class=codebox name="code" wrap=OFF readonly="true" rows="15" cols="80">

</textarea><br><br>But there isn't much of a point to that, unless you're dealing with generics. Even then, it's not all that useful. But anyway, the original point was regarding the lack of ability to write non-virtual code. Monkey still needs generic methods or functions, if you ask me. But the real problem was the fact that I had to use an interface. This is because the compiler blindly didn't care about the context where a class referred to itself. The example I gave works if you remove the generic elements, but of course, that can't be done under certain contexts. The big reasons to use generics are code generation and reuse. If I can't have a generic class hierarchy that unifies generic routines, then that's a limitation. Luckily, Monkey is really good about this normally, but I thought this particular problem was worth mentioning.<br><br>To put it simply, under circumstances like my initial example, I'd have to rely on virtual functionality for no reason. Now, virtual overhead is fine when the targeted CPU's branch prediction is solid, but I can't always expect that. Likewise, this kind of situation doesn't even need the extra overhead. Who knows, maybe I'm just over optimizing, but to me, maintaining an interface just doesn't seem worth it for this. There's just too much overhead that could be reduced on compile-time. I'm not expecting the complexity of C++'s templates, but Monkey's generic/template functionality is already really solid. I really just wanted to have a class to reference itself to the rest of the hierarchy. Monkey's compiler doesn't actually deduce this, it would seem. Instead, it just throws an error. This is why I think it's an unnecessary limitation, and it could be solved pretty easily.<br><br><b>EDIT: In case you're interested, I basically just went the interface route. The overhead was for loading managed resources to begin with, so it wasn't a runtime-level optimization. I ended up using this interface for another class of mine, so it ended up being beneficial. <a href="https://github.com/Regal-Internet-Brothers/resources" target="_blank">Here's the module I'm talking about.</a> It still needs to be optimized, but it's not a bad draft for what I needed.</b> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
