At first I didn't understand it, but then it dawned on me, the 'IntObject' class for some ungodly reason (Literally, the error was on line 666 of my 'vector' module) has a 'ToFloat' implementation.<br><br><b>This makes 'IntObjects' unusable without manually calling 'ToInt'. And since this is a generic/template class, I can't do that. I would just cast, but it's not like I have a way of telling what type it's based on.</b><br><br>The issue here is that 'Trans' doesn't look deep enough. As an example, try removing 'ToFloat' for 'IntObject'. The result causes an error when doing this: "Float(IO)"; where 'IO' is an 'IntObject'. And in my case, I can't even use explicit casting like that. Now, if 'Trans' checked if it had something to auto-convert with, this would just call 'ToInt' as expected.<br><br>You see, you can make the argument all you want about being explicit with "ToBlah", but this is broken. Not only is it an issue for commands like 'Abs' which take either a float or an integer, but this can also break generic classes in the process.<br><br><b>This leaves me at a dead end which can only be solved one of four ways:<br><br>1) You add a keyword for preferences with "ToBlah". (A final say on what should be done - Not a bad idea)<br>2) You remove the 'ToFloat' overload, and we push this off even longer.<br>3) You have 'Trans' look at the type for further conversion options after the fact (A VERY GOOD IDEA)<br>4) One of us makes awful versions of these commands that just call the normal versions (PLEASE DON'T DO THIS UNLESS IT'S TEMPORARY. I did this to my own code, and it was not fun. But Monkey itself relying on such hacks would get even more messy, not to mention go against the idea of "ToBlah")</b><br><br>A bit of elaboration on the third option: Going this route will allow you to remove those odd "ToBlah" instances, and it'll fix my issue.<br><br>And with a small bit of <b>eventual</b> work, it'll even fix that problem we've talked about previously (Conversion to super-classes being odd with "ToBlah"); though, that's a bit of a different subject.<br><br>The same goes for 'ToInt' in 'FloatObject' by the way. And no, don't remove auto-conversion for objects, there's no reason to; I know you've been on the fence about that. I use it on a regular basis, and I think it's a useful feature. You'd give me (And many others) far more headaches by removing it.<br><br>This issue also broke several parts of my code. (Which I was actually able to fix on my end. Which is at least acceptable, since there are ways of working around such issues with my own code)<br><br><b>Now I'm bottlenecked by this sort of bug again, but now it's undoubtedly an issue with Monkey's 'boxes' module (Deeper technically, but that's the surface issue).</b> If this doesn't get fixed, I'll have to make things even worse by creating private wrappers for default commands within my modules which use option 4. Or I could do it for the standard 'monkey' modules, but that's a ticking time-bomb. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The problem is (Though I could optimize things in my case for 'IntObjects') it's another function call for normal integers and floats. Assuming optimization fixes this, it's not a big deal, but I still end up having to write wrappers for everything. Given, I'll likely go with this approach anyway, but that shouldn't apply to all situations.

Method ToInt:Int() Preferred ' Or something with a better ring to it?
