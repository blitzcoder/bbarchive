I ended up with a project that would compile if just the last five files commented out. I could swap any of those files with any of the others and it would still compile, but if I imported just one <i>extra</i> file (even if it had no code in it) the compiler would die.<br><br>I then copied the contents of the last five files into one of the other spine files, and it compiles with no problems.<br><br>The spectacular irony here is that a few weeks ago, at the urging of another coder on the team, I went through our UI library and split <i>everything</i> into nice, readable, individual files.<br><br><br>=========================================================<br><br>I've been trying without success to integrate the Spine runtime module with an existing project.

Considering you're running an SSD, I doubt it's much of a disk bottleneck. And though dynamic casts are bad on many levels, a -O3 release build with GCC/MinGW, coupled with modern hardware shouldn't perform terribly.<br><br>Regardless of the bottleneck, the fact is, Monkey's build system is rather problematic. It generates a single native source file. And since compilers like g++ can't optimize builds based on individual changes, and instead can only do this based on per-file changes, you have to compile everything but the native frameworks every time. So, because of this, and a number of other problems, Mark's making Monkey 2.<br><br>Following the logic that Mark wants to build a better compiler, I can only assume this includes the semantic phase. As far as the compiler's design goes, it's a mess. The fact that dynamic casts are used anywhere other than corner cases is absurd. It's just not good practice at all. Other than being a specialization nightmare, they're similar to virtual calls, where the big performance hits are caused by cache misses. But unlike virtual calls, modern CPUs aren't anywhere near as good at handling dynamic casts as they are branch prediction. x64 CPUs today are <i>good enough</i> at dealing with this kind of thing, but it wouldn't surprise me if the abundant dynamic casts had a part in the performance problems. Especially when it's scaled up to something like this.<br><br><b>What I think needs to be understood is that Monkey's compiler is fast, but it's not exactly efficient, and it has some big design problems.</b> Because of this, it doesn't scale as well as it should. Unfortunately, to speed up the problems I mentioned, you'd have to overhaul a lot of it. This includes the other passes.<br><br>The only other thing I can say is to try configuring the garbage collector further (Max locals, etc). Or, you know, wait for Monkey 2, but that's a while out. I guess theoretically an easier way to chrunch that last bit of performance would be to make the translator output into separate files, then use g++'s <i>smart</i> building functionality.
