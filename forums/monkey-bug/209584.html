I agree with the sentiment that the warnings should be better, as you basically have to debug 'trans' to see what's missing. Other than that, you're saying that Monkey's compiler is doing its job. If the file doesn't exist, the module doesn't. The compiler just needs clearer warnings. I myself use the "optional module" behavior of Monkey all the time, as I have <a href="https://github.com/Regal-Internet-Brothers" target="_blank">all of these</a>, and I can't expect every single user to have every one. I have a repository that users can recursively clone for the primary modules, but that's still a lot to download. To this same effect, if someone just wanted my vector module, they could just grab that and 'util'. They wouldn't need the rest, because 'vector' only needs functionality described directly by 'util'. There's also a number of fixes for the standard "box" classes that I've added, and they generally need my 'boxutil' module. The big thing here is that 'boxutil' is optional. My 'retrostrings' module pretty much needs my 'stringutil' module (At least for the "extensions" to the command-set), and so on. The only thing 'trans' needs is better warnings, and maybe an "Optional" keyword for imports, but that's pushing it.<br><br>One of the major reasons I got Mark to change the preprocessor behavior, was for things to be done as they are imported. Sure, it's not perfect, but it gets the job done pretty well.<br><br>Here's an example of how I handle this, and generally speaking, it's what Mark does with some of his modules:<br><br>"main.monkey" (Build file):<br><textarea class=codebox name="code" wrap=OFF readonly="true" rows="15" cols="80">

	Return
End
</textarea><br><br>As you can see, this also makes things configurable from the imported module's side. For example, you could have 'x' rely on external components, and thus, say it's unavailable if the native files aren't available. You could also make the external portion an optional thing, and use a target-check to see if it should be set to 'True'. But on top of that, you can add just one more check, and you can make it so the user can force native/external bindings to be off (Or technically, on). <a href="https://github.com/Regal-Internet-Brothers/imageencoder" target="_blank">Here's my 'imageencoder' module, it does this</a>.<br><br>The only issue I see with this module is with small encapsulated projects ("Local" imports), but that's why I think the compiler needs better warnings. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I don't expect someone to clone all of my modules if they only want one or two. Likewise, changing this to an error would make it so there is literally no way to know if a module exists. This would also mean that some of my modules can't import optional extensions/back-ends automatically. My 'retrostrings' module does this. There isn't much of a reason to make it cause an error. A warning on the other hand, that's ideal. The compiler already does this currently, but the warnings aren't very descriptive. <a href="http://www.monkey-x.com/Community/posts.php?topic=9123" target="_blank">Do you not remember this thread?</a> That bug has been fixed already, but this was one of the reasons it needed to be fixed.

I personally don't see much of an issue with "porting" my own code to a "ModuleExists" setup (Though honestly, having a keyword would reduce boilerplate code). I just don't want to have no option but to fork Monkey. As long as I can easily handle optional modules, I don't see a problem with changing it. If you do add a way to check if a module exists, it shouldn't be hard to make a "request" version of 'Import' that acts as a macro for doing it manually.<br><br>Just curious, but how was it not completely obvious what I was doing? I showed you a full example illustrating the compiler's behavior, and referred to this kind of setup. My example even used the same preprocessor structure.<br><br>So, how would "#Import" work, then?
