Currently it is being handled where key states are watched and then a KEY_ESCAPE is faked into monkey world. A nice solution but monkey is not properly trapping all instances of back being pressed.<br><br>I am developing a chartboost module (ingame app advert lib) and the SDK requires that I manually close my advert if back is pressed when the advert is active. It doesn't open a separate view/activity but it does seem to override monkeys built in key monitoring. And so KEY_ESCAPE never gets trapped.<br><br>If I add this to the target Activity:<br><pre class=code>	@Override
	public void onBackPressed() {
		// --- handle back event pressed on android ---
		//we need to handle this as when cahrtboost is active, if back is pressed, monkey will exit the app
		if (ChartboostGlue::instance != null &amp;&amp; ChartboostGlue::instance.cb.onBackPressed()) {
			//block the back event
			return;
		} else {
			//allow default back event
			super.onBackPressed();
		}
	}</pre><br><br>Then everything works fine, but it would be good if monkey overloaded the onBackPressed() just to trap it further. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
