Part of learning game design is knowing how to construct the elements of the game to a level of detail that knowing the language is merely a formality.  To articulate this, however, you need to have some experience doing it, which used to require learning a programming language of some sort.  These days, you have many tools at your disposal, including Monkey.  However, Monkey may not be the easiest tool to start with.  It is, however, one of the more rewarding ones, if you want to learn it.<br><br>You should start your game on the assumption that you'll have to do it alone, and treat anyone you can manage to hire along the way as a bonus.  Otherwise, I hope you have a lot of money!  Good, reliable coders who can implement your vision don't come cheap.<br><br>Start with the help docs that come with Monkey, and check out the tutorials.  If the syntax is too confusing, an introduction to programming concepts on the internet somewhere could be helpful.  Like this:  <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introduction_To_Programming" target="_blank">http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introduction_To_Programming</a><br><br>From there, you'll want to start coming up with the design docs for your game.  This is an important step, and crucial if you're not using a Rapid Application Development tool.  There are so many moving parts in a working game that you basically have to design a "manual" to how the game works, a schematic if you will, that helps you and other coders focus on implementing each and every part.  This is how you would get started with it.  You have a general idea right now;  you need to break it into its component parts, and eventually explain how every single part works.  How detailed you need to be with that explanation before it gets turned into code depends on your experience, the tools you're using, and the people you're working with.  But it's usually far more details than most people think.  Start with the general, and dial your way down into the implementation details as needed!<br><br>Good luck on your project. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You should also find tutorials on the net for these subjects. Of course they will be written for another language such as C/C++, Java, C# etc. But the math and principles should be the same.  <br>The next thing you should do is start writing simple games first. Trying to run before you can crawl is a recipe for disaster.<br>Use google to search for tutorials on how some things maybe accomplished.<br>A game is not just programming. You will also have to deal with graphics and sound. Before using any thing from the internet. Make sure you can legally use such material for your intended purpose. This means reading licenses and the copyright.<br>You can hire someone to do these assets and programming for you, but they come at a price. And as you will be relying on a third party, they could leave you high and dry with a financial headache. There plenty of tools for you to create such assets. My experience with these is if you want good results, be prepared to pay for them and stay away from the cheep tools as they tend to be a waste of money. My favourite tools are<br>Paid: PhotoShop, Cinema4D, UVLayout, Ultimate Unwrap 3D ( I use this just to convert 3D object formats), Genetica seamless texture creator, TexturePacker and FL Studio<br>Free: GIMP, Blender, Audacity, Graphics Gale, ShoeBox Sprite Atlas maker<br>Note: Some free tools can come with restrictions on how you can use assets created with such tools.<br>A lot of the tools I listed have loads of tutorials on how to use them for various things. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You may find out that you end up running into more question marks than you realize. Don't hand-wave away the importance of this, nearly everyone ends up biting off more than they can chew at first.  At the very least you can be more prepared than someone in over their head who didn't draw up a map first.  But that's just for you, to start with.  When you start bringing on other programmers, you have to make sure the design doc clearly communicates all the things that need to be done and preferably how.<br><br>Perhaps the best bit of advice I can give is also the simplest:  <i>Be prepared to work very, very hard.</i>  You wanna be ready for this, and most people here will tell you that sometimes this stuff gets to be all-consuming.  Research, study, actual work on the game, concepts, prototypes, all of that stuff takes time, hard work and most of all the willpower to continue. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
