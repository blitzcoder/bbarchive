I am sure one else will pop along shortly with a much better explanation. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'd love to know more if Threading is affected by the ammount of CPU cores, in case it is affected that is. But knowing monkey supports threading is pretty much enough, I should go and inspect that diddy module then. Thanks a lot!)<br><br>In case anybody have something to add - that would be cool too) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

As you mention, Monkey's own garbage collection is not guaranteed to be 100% accurate when interacting with user threads, however the native GC for the target platform (if it has one) will generally work fine.<br><br>In the future I may investigate ways of handling this, but for now the best option is to only use user threads for processing existing data and not for creating many objects. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
