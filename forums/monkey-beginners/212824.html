The thing is, a lot of the people here are from BlitzPlus and BlitzMax backgrounds. They've been programming for years. I honestly don't think many of them, including myself, have a very accurate view on what it means to be new to programming and whether or not this is easy to understand.<br><br>Dynamically typed languages are generally easier to pick up than statically typed languages. Monkey X is statically typed and so automatically falls into a category considered more difficult for beginners. As an example, in php, a dynamic language, variables can be anything at all times.<br><pre class=code>$varName = 5;
$varName = "Hi";
$varName = 3.333;</pre><br><br>That language doesn't care about what type things are. On the other hand, in Monkey X...<br><pre class=code>Local varName := 5
varName = "Hi" 'Compilation fail</pre><br><br>It fails because varName is declared as an integer. Whereas you tried to assign it a "string" type (aka, text). In php you don't need to know those specifics to make things happen.<br><br>Things like that definitely trip up new people. At the same time, statically typed languages generally have cleaner code because of certain forced structure. A lot of php code looks like a mess, mostly because of the fact that it has such a low bar of entry, that lots of people learn it and suck at it (and also because it has the most inconsistent programming library in the world).<br><br>My point here is that you may find it easier to get introduced to programming via a different programming language that is for a different purpose than video games and then adapt later. I did not start out with video games, even though that was my ultimate goal. I'm honestly glad I didn't, because programming video games is difficult. It's actually one of the hardest kinds of programming I've done and I've done things most people here haven't, like making an autonomous robot run around my house powered by a little tiny Arduino. It's 2D space + time, which means it requires a form of 3 dimensional thinking. This takes time to learn and if you're trying to do that along with learning programming syntax and structure, you're basically setting yourself up to likely fail or be disappointed, and at the very least, definitely overwhelmed. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

As there are a few concepts that can be hard to understand for a beginner. As Goodlookingguy has said, you need to start with a simpler language; preferably one with lots of tutorials and good documentation. Unfortunately BRL products are well known not to have such things and you have to rely on the forums for help.<br>  <br>MonkeyX is what I would call an intermediate specialised <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC" target="_blank">BASIC</a> language similar to C# and Java, and is aimed at cross platform games creation. It's also one of those languages where you need to have a good understanding of the device that you are targeting, as there are times when you need to do a bit of 'DO IT YOURSELF' to get certain things to work. This means that you would have to know a number of other languages, tools and Software Development Kits. The whole idea behind MonkeyX is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_once,_compile_anywhere" target="_blank">write once, compile anywhere</a> to cut down on development time for deploying software to multiple devices.<br><br>Those in my generation would have owned an 8 bit home computer such as the Commodore 64 or ZX Spectrum, and in the 90's they would have had 16 bit computers such as the Commodore Amiga and early PCs. Virtually all of those computers back in the late 70s and the whole 80s era had a built-in BASIC programming language, and there were quite a lot of magazines that had articles on programming those machines. Plus a few of those computers came with very good manuals, or additional manuals you could purchase. The computers such as the Amiga and PC; you could buy third party programming languages, and again many came with good manuals and the most popular languages would have had articles about them on programming with them.<br><br><a href="http://www.basic.mindteq.com/" target="_blank">Here</a> is a web site that list an number of BASIC type languages.<br><br>Edit: As well as Invader Jim's tutorials there's <a href="http://www.monkey-x.com/Community/posts.php?topic=9290&amp;page=first" target="_blank">Pakz</a> series of examples. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I have to admit that I did have some coding background as a hobby programmer but still had some issues getting into Monkey. <br>In my opinion the downsides of monkey I read above are also advantages in the long run. If you really want to get into programming you will have to cope with all the things around and with monkey you get an insight to a lot of programming concepts you can also use, if you choose a different language later on.<br>so... If you want to take the monkey road I would like to help you with gasping the basics.

(Technically, mojo is a framework, but probably hardly anyone uses mojo without it, so you don't have to worry about "what is language and what is framework" so much as if you were using a games framework for Java or Python or whatever.

I've programmed in over 30 programming languages and worked with more than 8 game engines. Just off the top of my head, for games, LOVE engine is easier than Monkey. Lua is a powerhouse scripting language and the LOVE engine is quite robust. I've attempted to teach people Monkey as a starter language and it went about as successfully as trying to teach people Java or C++. It's more overwhelming than you might think. Right from the get go you're forced into a code structure and have no explanation that will make full sense to you until you have more experience. Let's on the other hand, look at my example language from before, php: It does things without needing to understand data types, arrays are all-in-one stack, maps, and lists. So there's no need to know about the various data collections. It has a huge library that does lots of things for you so that you can get a better understanding of how to just do things and not worry about the little things. It's structured like C languages, which will make those languages easier to adapt to, since they are more prominent in more engines anyways, making your choices more flexible.<br><br>Look, I like Monkey, it's obvious by the amount of code I've written for it, but I'm not fooling myself into believing that it's a great starter language. Also, Monkey is not BASIC. BASIC is BASIC. Monkey is a modern multi-paradigm OOP statically typed language that has homages to BASIC. BlitzPlus is far closer to BASIC and actually I'd recommend that any day over Monkey for beginners. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The language may be defunct, but there is <a href="http://www.freebasic.net" target="_blank">FreeBasic</a> available for Windows, Linux and DOS (no OS X). If I recall, it has it's origins in Microsoft's QBasic, and has a compiler mode to compile such QBasic code.<br>I would start by leaning the fundamentals of programming with that before moving on to MonkeyX. Once you have a good understanding, it should only take a few months to get a grip of MonkeyX, but you will need to know a few things about computer hardware to get the best out of any programming to do with creating games.<br><br>If I was going to teach someone programming I would start with:<br>- explaining in basic simple terms for example the CPU (brain), GPU(drawing pad), RAM(jumbled up short term memory), ROM(commandments set in a stone tablet), hard drives(paper, pencil and eraser), along with input/output devices (two way communication via keyboard, mouse, monitor and computers talk to each other by networks).<br>- explaining how a computer stores data in it's native form. This means explaining binary numbers and the fact that the term <b>bit</b> is a acronym for <b>b</b>inary dig<b>it</b> and represents a part of a memory address that is turned either on or off and correlates as a one to one with base two number depending on it's position within that memory location.<br>- explaining how real world numbers are translated into binary; this would include the difference between signed and unsigned numbers.<br>- explaining the relationship between stored data and how that it translates into what you actually see on screen. e.g. character code and it's glyph data.<br>- explain the <b>K</b>eep <b>I</b>t <b>S</b>imple <b>S</b>illy principle and how complex problems should be broken up into more manageable parts.<br> <br>Once I've got the basic concepts out of the way, I would start with:<br>- basic outputting of text and basic maths functions and operators.<br>- introduce variables and basic data types. For a language like C/C++ I would get the simple basics of a pointer out of the way, as you need to know these for a number of operations. <br>- basic input of text.<br>- basic string manipulation<br>- Begin program flow with: basic program conditionals with IF/THEN/ELSE and SELECT/CASE, iterators FOR/NEXT, REPEAT/UNTIL and WHILE/WEND, Functions and returning values from functions<br>- introduce arrays<br>- move on to more advanced math and string manipulation.<br>- introduce more advanced topics such as binary operations, variable references, collection types and custom types, but keeping custom types simple to start with; meaning no full Object-Oriented Programming.<br>- introduce Object-Oriented Programming basics along with advantages and disadvantages. I think the easiest way to explain to someone what an Object-Oriented Programming data object is; is for them to visualise it as a mini self contained program that can be created and destroyed by the main program when needed, with input and output functions that can be call from the main program.<br>- introduce GUI programming.<br>- introduce more advanced topics of algorithms after they have become more proficient with the language.<br>- introduce game programming, which would require another look at hardware in more detail.<br><br>Boulderdash, you have missed the one key thing that Novalis has said...<br>And that is:<br><div class="quote"> someone who's never done a line of code in their life? <br></div><br>If Novalis has had no experience what so ever; then Novalis will have a hard time with a simple language, let alone a more complex language such as MonkeyX. This could mean also that Novalis has no real understanding of how computers work. As I stated earlier: MonkeyX is specialised niche language with a small community, little in the way of tutorials and incomplete documentation meaning no details of use for some of the commands and functions. The only help he would find is on these forums, and Novalis may not get an answer to any question for days, weeks, months or not at all. Many of the questions asked have been repeat over and over and the answers are elsewhere in the forums, and I would think that a few here don't bother to answer for that very reason as all it takes is a few minutes to search. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Well back in the 8 bit era you really had to know the hardware and it's limitations to get the best out of it. It's the same thing with modern hardware. The most important thing from a game programming perspective is speed. Games are real-time applications and any thing that can slow a game down would make it choppy, not fun to play and in some cases unplayable. Modern PC's make knowing the exact hardware difficult because they can be customised, but they all have to comply to a general standard. So can take it that any device such as a graphics card would work in a similar way.<br>Speaking of graphic cards leads us to one of the things that you need to know:<br>The graphics card can only hold a limited amount of images. In older hardware images(aka textures) are stored in powers of 2; though newer graphics card as far as I know don't need to do this anymore, but I would suspect that there is small performance hit as a GPU would be able to handle a power of two image much quicker. So back to images in a power of 2. An image with a size of 50x100 would need to take an the memory size for an image of 64x128 (a size in a power of 2). This means that there is a lot of wasted memory space, but wait, there is more. <a href="https://simonschreibt.de/gat/renderhell/" target="_blank">Here's a lovely article</a> that I think that should cover the problems with graphics cards.<br><br>Do a search on 'Why use sprite sheets and texture atlas' or 'What are sprite sheets and texture atlas'. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
