Pretty much the best you can do is to try to ensure that you can verify that a score is reasonable and that you have some way of responding to suspicious scores.<br><br>So, you need some form of account/id/product key system that allows you identify the source of score submissions. Score checking depends on the design of your game but essentially it's about trying to judge if a submission actually resulted from someone playing the game. You can track time played, score over time, test against known possible score limits for particular levels etc. The gold standard is getting the client to send a full replay which the server can then check by playing it back, but this requires that your game is deterministic.*<br><br>Once you've determined that a player is likely spoofing you can then ban them or, maybe better, shadow-ban them or just cull the scores or whatever you like.<br><br>*Note that this still doesn't stop cheating via things like botting or slowing the game down. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

A leader-board (Or a similar setup) is a different beast than simply encrypting your data. If people are hacking your game, and being destructive by doing that, then you should be taking action. But if they're simply modifying the game, or messing with memory, you should just let them.<br><br>If they start affecting other people or systems, that's when you should step in. If someone wants to modify your game, they'll do it. And I don't see any reason to stop them. It's when it gets out of hand that you should be concerned about. And because you want to create a stable ecosystem (Like most developer's would), you should be working on the anti-cheat/anti-hack techniques that make your normal users immune to anomalies. You shouldn't bother stopping people who are going to break your code, anyway. Anything you do from the client can be hacked (Unless you're doing something <b>very advanced</b> with several clients), but the closed environment of a server is different. Take for example, most online multiplayer games. They're supposed to have several layers of security for stopping cheating and hacking. And though this work should be done, you should only do it in order to make the experiences of the normal users stable. If someone's cheating, you should not only have code in place to stop them, but also do the work to ban them (Or a similar system) when needed.<br><br>Obfuscation is done on some targets, anyway, but it doesn't do much but <i>potentially</i> slow people down. But no matter the target, you shouldn't be modifying your existing code to have weird names, or to constantly check variables. Because, as someone who started by hacking, I can tell you that anything you do in your code can either be switched for something else, or studied enough to be modified. Names aren't needed, and using base64 for normal text can be a serious waste of time. And trust me, obfuscating everything never works. You can even look at games which use <i><strike><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NProtect_GameGuard" target="_blank">Game Guard</a></strike></i>, for example. They use really low level techniques, sometimes even dirty hacks, and they can be compromised with a simple DLL injection. And there's a ton of horrible things Game Guard does to users' systems, like stopping them from running their own media players and muting the game. Or making programs outright crash if they're started after the game. Or even making it so users can't alt-tab out of fullscreen, or even windowed mode.<br><br>The point I'm trying to make is that you're looking at this wrong. Your games shouldn't focus on keeping hackers and modders out, but instead keeping things stable for normal users. Sure, security should always be a priority, but obfuscating your memory isn't the way to go. That effort should be put into security that really matters. Companies like Valve have already shown that rewarding modders and hackers is a good thing. And when people have a platform for their mods, they don't need to do any work hacking through other means.<br><br>This is why games like Doom and Quake became as open as they did. It's better to let people modify and hack the game within reason. Doom even had a level editor, for crying out loud. Not to mention that the source code for the first three Doom games has already been released.<br><br>Personally, I like the Doom approach. Games I release will likely have most (If not all) of their source code provided as public domain after a while. I think modding should be a big part of a game, so I may very well put in work to get more advanced modding working, without editing the game's memory or executable. For example, some games use Lua, Squirrel, or even Python for further modding potential. As far as Monkey goes, <a href="http://www.monkey-x.com/Community/posts.php?topic=3616&amp;page=1" target="_blank">MiniC</a> and <a href="http://www.monkey-x.com/Community/posts.php?topic=7733&amp;page=1" target="_blank">MiniC N. Edition</a> are options, as well as several external routes.<br><br>I wrote a <a href="http://www.monkey-x.com/Community/posts.php?topic=9204#96409" target="_blank">similar post about this a month or so back</a>, if you're interested.<br><br><b>The moral of the story is: Put the work in for what actually matters, don't put significant work into security that's meaningless. And if it's a <i>matter of security</i> that can be handled on a server (Like with a leader-board), work on that. It's better to keep security essential things away from the client when possible; well, unless you're writing a node-based security system, but that's another discussion.</b> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I understand that I wouldn't be able to completely stop from doing it, but making it a bit more difficult than someone taking over the scoreboard with a few clicks seems like a reasonable thing to protect. If the goal of your game is a high score board, the minute someone injects their name with 9billion scores, no one would play it anymore.<br><br>Of course I am not any kind of hacker, in the classic sense, but I would like to protect the scores for users who enjoy playing games just to compete for the high scores.<br><br>I am really interested to hear how some people approached this. One of the methods that I believe would be required is encrypting the data sent to and from the server. I am not sure of the best method for doing this, but so far, using SSL seems to be a good route.<br><br>As for obfuscating in game data, the purpose of this wouldn't be to hide code but to keep people from altering the scores artificially. What good would playing any game for hours be if when you submit the score, you see someone named "Poop" has all the high scores and they are unrealistic? No one would ever play the game.<br><br>I totally agree with the ability to modify games. That is a beautiful model for any game and one that has led to some of the best games out there. Counterstrike is one of the best examples of this. I can only dream of creating something as awesome as that someday! <br><br>As of now, each of the games I wrote have been stepping stones for learning certain things and trying out different languages. Some day, I hope to create a tutorial section on my site which will give out all the code of my games. It may be a bit embarrassing and people will definitely laugh at how I coded certain things, but in the end I would learn a lot from that experience too. <br><br>I really appreciate the information and the time you took writing that!
