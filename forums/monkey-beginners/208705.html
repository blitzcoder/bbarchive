If you build one of the samples as a desktop application and take a look in the .build directory and explore the contents of the glfw folder. You will see the there are a number of directories and a few files. The main.cpp file is the source code generated by the MonkeyX compiler. This is what your MonkeyX code gets converted to and is a single file. Now imagine having to maintain that. Now in this directory is another called glfw. This is where the code resides for building the glfw library that is needed by the application. If you explore the contents of this directory you will see that it is broken into a number of files. This make it much easier for some to update or fix bugs. The files that you see with the .o extension are object files. These are compiled source code that are used during the linking stage to create the final executable application. The files with the h extension are know as header files. These are usually used to for defining function proto types and variable definitions.<br><div class="quote"> Nothing to do with memory management? <br></div>It has nothing to do with memory management. Only for the management of your project. You would manage memory within your application when running. MonkeyX uses what is know as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_%28computer_science%29" target="_blank">Garbage Collection.</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It would seem very odd to try to fit everything in one file.<br><br>The program will work in both cases, but in one case you retain the conceptual model of the application "the big picture" and in other case you loose it. Chances is that if you read your code after 3 years and having forget everything (or another person reads your code for the first time), you will understand it ASAP but with poorly written code you will loose lots of time trying to fixing it that in the end you will have to start over. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

At the moment I've decided to use TED, so I put things like game logic in one file, all classes for that. And code that doesn't relate in a "lexical" way or is another language anyway I put in other files. And I hate writing declarations twice (http://www.lazycplusplus.com/) but that's not a problem in Monkey. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Frustration is the biggest Mojo killer. If you struggle to complete a section of your game or fix a bug and it is because of poor project management you'll soon find that quitting is the only option. Why? Quitting relieves your mind of being frustrated at fixing a mess. When things are organized and flowing beautifully quitting is the last option. Why? Because the thought of Quitting when productivity is high and progress is extensive, that calm feeling and buzz you get when your coding Mojo is at its apex, is the last thing you want to do.<br><br>Preparing yourself to successfully code by planning ahead making sure to avoid anything that will frustrate you is way better than diving in to a project blind at what might happen. <br><br>Your mindset is key here. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
