It was then and still is now a good introduction to Monkey as a language. It isn't a great reference guide for everything the language does if that's what you're looking for (and as far as I know, that doesn't exist) but it does take you through creating a bunch of small games, teaching you as you go.<br><br>Well worth $5 <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Write code every day even if you are simply rewriting code from an example. Make flash cards and study them with Anki software, only make flash cards of things you already understand. Reviewing every day using spaced repetition, which Anki does, will help you to memorize and not forget, which is important. Never copy and paste code while learning. Use "site:monkey-x.com search term" in Google for anything you get stuck on. Do not be afraid to ask any questions. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

My biggest learning issue is not following through - I will go for periods where I code, then don't touch Monkey for 6+ months then have to refresh myself.  As Soap said, the best thing you can do is code everyday.  But if the book is selling for $5 you'd be crazy not to buy it - you'll easily get your moneys worth out of it even if you don't intend to go down the fantom engine route. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The first 2 games in the book are written in plain Monkey/mojo1 if i remember correctly. Invader Jims videos are perfect to get a good picture of the language. And so is the documentation that ships with monkey.<br>My book concentrates more on game development. 99.5% is still valid. It will give you a good overview over my framework.<br>I doubt i will see another dime for selling the book but for 5 usd i would buy it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
