I have hardly done any 3D game programming or development. I learn best from video tutorials coupled with good forums (like this one) to ask questions in. Thus, unless there are some good video tutorials about how to do 3D programming in Monkey-X, I was considering learning 3D game programming/development via tools such as Alice or Unity. Has anyone used any of the latter tool sets yet? What are your thoughts about them? Would Alice really help me learn  game programming aspects of 3D game programming? It looks very intuitive.  That is, I consider myself a serious hobby game developer, I want to get better, I enjoy programming and programming would also help me see how 3D game development works. But, at the same time, I'd like to have good video tutorials where I could learn it and a place where I could ask question like I do on this forum or post code, etc. so people could help me if I need help or if something is confusing. That's exactly how I learned 2D game programming. Thus, any ideas? Thanks! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Last summer I decided to look for a more traditional programming style of development for 2D games. After checking out many options I decided on Monkey X. In fact, any new 2D games I work on will be done in Monkey X.<br><br>[was typing on cell phone and got a phone call... anyway...]<br><br>What I like about Monkey X is that it had exactly what I was looking for. A no-nonsense way to just focus completely on programming a game. No Integrated Scene Editor thing I was forced to learn and work in. Just open a code editor and get to work.<br><br>Anyway, so I decided to use MX1 for all future 2D game dev work and use Unity3D for 3D game dev.<br><br>Last month I finally got into 3D game dev with Unity3D:<br><a href="http://gamejolt.com/games/fps-action-adventure/118423" target="_blank">http://gamejolt.com/games/fps-action-adventure/118423</a><br><br>However, I found myself basically wrestling with the same kind of things as before. So, I just spent quite a bit of time scouring the Internet looking for options.<br><br>I finally narrowed it down to MOGRE (.Net version of Ogre3D), Irrlicht Lime (.Net version of Irrlicht) and OpenTK (a .Net wrapper of OpenGL and OpenAL). I dropped MOGRE and Irrlicht Lime simply because I couldn't get MOGRE to work at all and both it and Irrlicht Lime looked like they were fairly outdated.<br><br>So, I decided to just go with C# and OpenTK:<br><a href="http://garsgames.com/blog/game-development/testing-code-oriented-3d-gamedev/" target="_blank">http://garsgames.com/blog/game-development/testing-code-oriented-3d-gamedev/</a><br><br>I have basically just got started on this adventure so have not made much progress yet. However, I am looking forward to it. Mainly because it is all just programming. No fancy editors and other foolishness to mess around with.<br><br>Anyway, I said all of that just to say... I'd recommend that you keep this in mind. Things like Construct, Unity and others are fine game engines. They really are. People can and do make many impressive looking games with them.<br><br>However, when you rely on things like these you are kind of shooting off your own foot in my opinion. Because you are not gaining any real understanding of how to do this stuff. You become very dependent on these high level tools. And ultimately as your projects grow in scope you will find yourself bumping into limitations in such systems.<br><br>Things that if you just had access to some lower level programming would be fairly easy to do instead become nearly impossible.<br><br>So, basically if you only want to do projects of the kind of scale that you see commonly made in Unity3D (which truly is a pretty broad range) then just go with Unity3D. It will make it all a lot simpler especially if you prefer working visually inside an editor.<br><br>I do not like working visually in those editors. For me it is much slower than simply programming it all. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Yes similar to you, I'd like to gain full understanding of 3D programming/development and its process and it's in's and out since I consider myself one who is a serious about game development/programming for the long hall (as a hobbyist). DruggedBunny, after doing some serious thinking, I think Blitz 3D/Mini3DB might be a good place to start. I'm actually familiar with BlitzBasic 2D and in fact, that was my first programming language (it is part of why I'm here too). Here's another reason why I think Blitz 3D would be good. Well, both this page and the BlitzBasic page has been some of the better pages that I have gotten the most help from when learning from scratch even back when I started with BlitzBasic. I can't say that about other pages. I even went to these two sites and learn about other language like Java and Javascript. So, going with Blitz 3D (and you all said Mini3d) it'll just be an extension to what I'm already doing. Well, that's great and it seems like I would learn sufficient programming knowledge or 3D programming or otherwise just by doing what I'm already doing. So, I think that's a good idea!! And besides, one of my main goals besides doing 3D development is to continue making web games (because I like those the most). Thus, since BlitzBasic 3D is similar to Mini3D, it could be my doorway to making those as well.Thus, that's a good idea. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You're doing many things differently today, shaders replaced CPU tasks, so achieving certain things works differently, the workflow/pipeline has changed, new lighting/material setups, physics driven collisions, ... you also don't start with a hidden line removal 3d engine anymore (unless you want that look and also then you would do it differently).<br><br>A beginner could try Unity. It's free (if you can deal with the splash screen) and has a huge community (tutorials). It's not the best engine (which depends on your needs) but an allrounder nonetheless and comes with a nice rendering engine (and its own erratic stutters). If you're into sound, you'll most likely enjoy it.<br><br>It could work like this, you open the editor, create a project (just like in Monkey, the lazy Max days are over), create an empty object in the scene, create one or more scripts objects which you attach to the former object. Within the script objects you code in C# and trigger all the functions which are exposed from the engines (game/render/sound/...).<br><br>You'll get yourself running around in a forest of stuff just by code. At some point you'll want to alter materials, position objects more intuitively, play around with the lighting, add shaders, mix sounds, ... In pure code you can be rather blind, so you'll write a simple interface in order to test and adjust stuff easier and faster. You can do this on your own or utalise the editor.<br><br>A subset of the functionality is available to the editor and the scripts. To a large degree it's up to you, how much you go by code and/or the editor. You can learn a lot this way, stay motivated (things look yummy in modern engines) and get dirty too. After this you might enjoy the stuff happening behind the scenes and/or have a better understanding about what you like/dislike and need/don't need.
