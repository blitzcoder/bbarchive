Here is a code example:<br><br><pre class=code>
Strict

Class Coordinates
  Public
  
  Method New()
    x = -1
    y = -1
  End Method
  
  Field x:Int, y:Int
End Class

Class Test
  Public
  
  Method GetCoordinates1:Coordinates()
    Local coordinates:Coordinates = New Coordinates()
    coordinates.x = 10
    coordinates.y = 20    
    Return coordinates
  End Method
  
  Method GetCoordinates2:Int(coordinates:Coordinates)
    coordinates.x = 100
    coordinates.y = 200
    Return 0
  End Method
  
End Class

Function Main:Int()
  Local test:Test = New Test()
  
  ' Test #1
  Local coordinates1:Coordinates = test.GetCoordinates1()
  Print("x=" + coordinates1.x + "; y=" + coordinates1.y)
  
  ' Test #2
  Local coordinates2:Coordinates = New Coordinates()
  test.GetCoordinates2(coordinates2)
  Print("x=" + coordinates2.x + "; y=" + coordinates2.y)
  
  Return 0
End Function
</pre><br><br>The printout from the above program is the following:<br><br>x=10; y=20<br>x=100; y=200<br><br>In Test #2 I guess that a reference is passed for the Coordinate object, so that should be okay.<br><br>In Test #1 I thought that such operation would have been ilegal, but it seems to work (printout is as expected). Is it that when "test.GetCoordinates1()" is called (in Main), the actual object is copied into "Local coordinates1:Coordinates"? Because if it's just the reference, I guess it would have been garbage collected when GetCoordinates1() was done executing... or?<br><br>Any input is appreciated!<br><br>Thanks! :-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There's no copy operations; at least, language defined operations you should worry about. When 'GetCoordinates1' is executed, it creates an object with the garbage collector. What's returned is a reference to this object. Optimization aside, your local 'coordinates' variable has a reference to this new object. Of course, from here, you mutate what's in the object as expected. Then, when you're finished, you return the reference to the garbage collected object. This can then be used by whatever code called the function or method. In your case, you passed the reference to 'coordinates1'. This means the object stays around. Monkey has several garbage collection modes, and several targeted collectors, depending on the target. The main idea of garbage collection is that, you create an object, and you have automatic references to that object. When all references are gone, the object is free. When the object is free, it's up to the collector to eventually deal with it. This can range wildly between GC implementations. For games, Monkey mainly uses a deterministic approach, where a set amount of time each update can be spent managing memory. <b>Despite the differences in garbage collection modes, the idea remains the same: Don't care about how the object gets freed.</b> That doesn't mean you shouldn't care about the costs of creating objects, just that you shouldn't care when they get destroyed.<br><br>So, following this mindset, creating an object, then passing a reference as a return-value is perfectly acceptable.<br><br><b>EDIT: If you're interested in learning more about memory management in Monkey, I've made a pretty good number of posts about it. Here's one I made about the <a href="http://www.monkey-x.com/Community/posts.php?topic=9436#98036" target="_blank">C++ targets' GC</a>, and <a href="http://www.monkey-x.com/Community/posts.php?topic=9321" target="_blank">this thread has some posts</a> (Several by myself) about memory management in general. You could also tread through my other forum posts, but I don't recommend it.</b> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The idea of GC is that the object only gets destroyed when there is no reasonable way for you to refer to it again.<br><br>When GetCoordinates1() is called, a new Coordinates object is created, and a reference to it (essentially, its address in RAM) is returned.
