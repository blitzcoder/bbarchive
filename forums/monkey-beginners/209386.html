Basically it does exactly what I was looking for. The data from the game is immediately encrypted and decrypted on the webserver side. It cost me around $40 a year. But will also allow for secure logins/password/username or financial data to be transmitted securely.<br><br>After testing this using wireshark, I noticed that all gets and posts were encrypted where they were not previously.<br><br>I was looking for any feedback from anyone to see if this is going to be enough to keep people from hijacking the score boards or to see if there are more procedures that should be implemented.<br><br>Thanks for any help! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I personally like hosting my own  score boards though, I'm sure its an OCD control thing, lol. <br><br>As for changing the scores in memory, thats where the MonkeyX encryption methods would be used and there are alot of options out there for this. But if you just encrypt the scores within monkeyX to keep people from altering in game, but don't encrypt the transmission to the score board, you would be in the same boat.<br><br>The ideal thing would be to encrypt both inside MonkeyX to keep people from altering game data and to encrypt any data sent back and forth to the webserver, wether using a score board or making a multiplayer game.<br><br>I just haven't seen any information on encrypting the data sent to and from the webserver.<br><br>Thanks for the information! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
