The language is great and has a real helpful community, but after the announcement in Mark's Blog, and after I finished my project, I looked what other 2D game engines exist. My fear was that after month of work for a game, the target i want to use, doesn't work anymore, because of an update of the device I want to deploy and all my work was for nothing . The problem that I had with other 2D Game Engines was that they cost a load of money or the lacking of a good documentation. I looked at cocos-js too and the documentation wasn't even existent I had to look at the cocos-x documentation and cocos-x is C++ and this is by far not my favorite language. Then I found libgdx. It's a Java based 2D Engine with a good documentation and a lot of tutorials. The Cons is that is not as easy as Monkey and Framework changes often, so that most of the tutorials are outdated. <br>Nevertheless, I look every day in the monkey-forum if there is an announcement, maybe that a 3rd-Party Developer took over. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

As a pure hobbyist coming from BlitzMax, I didn't find the syntax too hard to learn, and I find the OOP approach convenient. I have no idea about IAP since I don't need it.

But when you look at the indie game dev tool market, a lot of the tools died or are dying. Because their devs don't get a financial return. Monkey. BMax, GlBasic, Gideros, etc.  If you want a supported tool with great functionality, you need to pay. Which tools are doing well? Unity, Corona, Gamemaker, etc. Some are lower priced but lack functionality. But they have a market where you can add that functionality and the company still gets a share of it. Unity would not be free if their market would not exist. Heard now from 4 devs that it is mandatory to get either PRO or add stuff with extensions.<br>Anyway, Projects need a constant income stream to succeed.

Yes you have to pay for modules if you want for example export to android or Ios but it's not very expensive (2,5 X minus than GMS module). And Clickteam Fusion 2.5, at the same as there is no code here, it's a great software too for games making (some games are kickstartered, greenlighted and so on).

I would always wait for a sale there anyway, which they run usually 2-3 times a year.

In fact I don't like it, I can't understand that they can let indies users be able to have dynamic shadows on their project and let this "feature" only for pro version...Indies (with free version) have the right to be able to make a real 3D rendering for their project. I don't think that this feature must be an "only pro" feature, this is my feel.<br><br>For Fusion 2.5, for the complete product may be, but for some people like me that just only want desktop , android and may be html5...and the dev version is not mandatory. And what about yoyo compiler ? 300  $ just to be able to execute faster some IA algo ?...The thing that I don't like with yoyo is this kind of thing :"he ho users ! we've got a great new feature for you, brand new and powerfull blablabla.......but it cost 299$ if you want it or buy the master collection !" yeaaah...and you with your poor pro version and you small module you cry :D<br><br>We can pay for having a great product, but pay each new feature is a non sense to me.

The thing that make yoyo up their buisiness is that their compiler is now based on C++ and not Delphi. The product is great (at the same as I'm not a fan about GML style, not because of syntax but because you have script a little everywhere on your project, and it's difficult for me to have something structured), and powerfull. And the "plus" they have if we want to compare some solutions is that their applications are native, unlike some products that only wrap your project in a html5 app launched on the device (like construct 2).<br><br>I reconize their work but if you don't have the master collection (in one time), it may be a little expensive in "fine".<br><br>Just for info : <a href="http://help.yoyogames.com/entries/102854766-YYC-and-Pricing-Changes-November-2014" target="_blank">http://help.yoyogames.com/entries/102854766-YYC-and-Pricing-Changes-November-2014</a><br><br>That means that each module that can have the YCC compiler will now cost 299$ instead of 199. Just because they prefer remove YYC compiler to move it directly into module...I'm pretty sure they will make an YCC compiler 2 just to increase the prize again by 100 :D They said that's because some users ask blablabla. I think in fact that is because they don't sell YCC compiler too much and, it's more easy to do that and earn much more money with modules that are more sold than their YCC compiler ^^ <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
