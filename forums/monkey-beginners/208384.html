They may work for you. Don't drag every thing into the Applications directory. It's meant of for applications. Instead make a directory in your home {home} folder called sdk and place software development kits and tools in there.<br><br>My notes at some point I will do a proper how to.<br>Monkey-X Installation on OS X<br><br>NOTE: Before downloading any files go in to the Safari Preferences and uncheck Open "safe" files after downloading to stop archive files being automatically extracted.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Installing Xcode<br>Current version xcode_5.0.2.dmg as of Feb 2014 requires OS X 10.8.4<br>Includes iOS 7.0.3 SDK and OSX 10.9 SDK.<br><br>You can get Xcode via the Apple App store or go to the apple developer web site <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/index.action" target="_blank">https://developer.apple.com/xcode/index.action</a><br>You will need to have an apple ID to download anything.<br><br>The developers download site is a bit messy to find what you are looking for. Use the pane on the left to narrow the Categories to just the Developer Tools and use the the search bar above it to look for Xcode. The latest is usually at the top of the list. It’s a big download at 2GB+ and includes the developer toolset for Mac, iPhone, iPod touch, iPad and includes iOS SDK with the latest version of the OS X SDK.<br><br>Once it has downloaded double click the .dmg image found in the downloads directory to mount it. It will open a window that will show two icons and a arrow between them. The icon named Xcode can be drag-n-dropped into the icon named Applications. You can then double click the Applications icon to take you the where Xcode has just been installed or use finder and navigate to Applications in Favourites. You can close the Xcode disk (dmg) image file and unmount (eject) it as it is no longer needed. You can eject by right clicking the Xcode drive icon and selecting Eject or open finder to do the same.<br><br>Double click to run Xcode, it will warn you that it was a file download from the internet and ask you if you wish to open it. It will also ask you for your admintrator password as some things need to be registered with the system.<br>When this is completed then you should see the Welcome to Xcode dialog.<br><br>The first thing you should do is go to the Xcode Preferences (cmd+,) in the menu bar at the top and click downloads. as there maybe addition components or updates to install.<br><br>The next thing is to go to Organiser (shift+cmd+2) found in Xcode’s application menu bar under Window.<br>Click Devices icon to list the current Devices this will list what devices are currently registered. On a clean install of OS X and Xcode you should only see your Mac computer. If you have connected a iPhone etc you may see this as well. When you click the My Mac device in the list you will see a button that says Enable Developer Mode and underneath a description of what it does. You can build Monkey applications without enabling this but at some point you will have to use Xcode and it's tools directly. You will require a administrator password to enable developer mode.<br><br>You can now quit Xcode.<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Installing Monkey-X<br>Using MonkeyPro77f<br><br>The only place to get Monkey-X is to download it from the Monkey-X web site<br><a href="http://www.monkey-x.com" target="_blank">http://www.monkey-x.com</a><br><br>After you have downloaded the Monkey-X zip file; extract it and move the Monkey-X directory to a location of your choice.<br><br>As Monkey-X was not distributed via the Apple Store, just clicking the Monkey icon will not work unless you have gone into the system preferences and change this action via Security &amp; Privacy to “Anywhere".<br><br>The other way is to get it to run is a three stage process as you have to right click the main Monkey application and select open in the context menu. Then you need to do the same for Ted that is found in the bin directory. Within the bin directory is an application called mserver_macos, so you should do the same for is application as this application is a minimal server for use with HTML5 builds, it will ask you if you wish to allow or deny access for network communication so you should allow it.<br><br>When you first run Monkey you will have these targets available<br>C++ Tool (don't think this is available on the free version)<br>Desktop Game<br>HTML5 Game<br>iOS Game (note this is only available with the Monkey-X Pro version)<br><br>The other targets which are only available in the Monkey-X Pro version after the relevant SDK and tools installed are<br>Flash Game<br>Android Game<br>Android (OUYA) Game<br><br>When adding other target SDK's. You will have to edit the path variables in the Monkey-X config.macosx.txt file to where they are located.<br>NOTE: There are special variables in the path that are used as abbreviations. These are<br>${MONKEYDIR}	Location of the Monkey.app<br>${HOME}			Location of the current users home directory<br><br>To develop a application for an iOS device or to distribute via the Apple AppStore you need to have signed up to the relevant developer program.<br><a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/" target="_blank">https://developer.apple.com/programs/</a><br><br>Note: Sometimes the Xcode project file will need to be updated when a new version of Xcode is released. This becomes apparent when compilation fails. To solve this issue you can either open the Xcode project files in Monkey-X templates (Xcode templates can be found in MonkeyX[Pro]XXX-&gt;targets-&gt;ios-&gt;template or Monkey[Pro]XXX-&gt;targets-&gt;glfw-&gt;template-&gt;Xcode) or open the Xcode project files in the .build directory.<br>select from the Xcode application menubar Edit-&gt;Validate Settings. This will update the Xcode project file.<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Installing Java and the JDK (need for both flash and android targets)<br>Current version 7 update 51 as of Feb 2014 <br>Files jre-7u51-macosx-x64.dmg and jdk-7u51-macosx-x64.dmg<br><br>Download both the JRE and the JDK disk image files .dmg from the Oracle web site.

Click the install button and enter the administrator password when prompted. After installation Safari will open to Oracle's Java installation test page. Click the red Verify Java Version button and when prompted to run Java Detection, click the Run button.<br><br>Do the same now for JDK disk image. The installation is the same, but without Safari doing the checking.<br>To check that the JDK is successfully installed you need to do it from the command line.<br>You will find the program called "Terminal" in "Applications-&gt;Utilities". This is what is used for anything that require command lines.<br><br>In this terminal type:<br>java -version<br><br>You should see something like the message below if all has gone well.<br>java version "1.7.0_51"<br>Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_51-b13)<br>Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.51-b03, mixed mode)<br><br>Note: The JDK is not updated automatically and I would highly recomend that you keep the JDK up to date to avoid Java runtime clashes and possible security issues.<br><br>Some important information about Apple Java 6 Plugin<br><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/mac/mac-preferences.html" target="_blank">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/mac/mac-preferences.html</a><br>Some import information on installation and removal of JDK's <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/mac/mac-jdk.html" target="_blank">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/mac/mac-jdk.html</a><br>Some information on ire installation and removal.<br><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/mac/mac-jre.html" target="_blank">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/mac/mac-jre.html</a><br><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/mac/mac-install-faq.html" target="_blank">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/mac/mac-install-faq.html</a><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Installing Android SDK (needs ANT and JDK to work)<br>Current version r22.3 as of Feb 2014<br><a href="https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html" target="_blank">https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html</a><br><br>On the download web page you can either click USE AN EXISTING IDE or DOWNLOAD FOR OTHER PLATFORMS. In the other platforms section you need the Platform Mac OS X 32 &amp; 64-bit Platform in SDK Tools Only, which is what gets downloaded when you click USE AN EXISTING IDE.<br><br>After it has download, extract the archive and move the android-sdk-macosx directory to a location of your choice.<br>You will then need to run the android sdk manager (named android) that is found in android-sdk-maxosx/tools.<br>When this is executed it will warn you that this is a file download from the internet and would you like to proceed with execution. It will then open a console window and then the Android SDK Manager.<br><br>In the Packages lists add the Android 3.2 (API 13) package by clicking the check box and then click the Install packages button. It asks you to accept the licenses and will then download the actual Android SDK files.<br><br>Once this task is complete you can close the two windows that were opened. You must then open the file config.macosx.txt and add/modify the ANDROID_PATH variable with path to the android-sdk-macosx directory. I recommend that you use the Monkey-X IDE to open the config file and switch the file filter to All Files so you can select it, unless you have turned of smart quotes and dashes in the OS X default text editor. If you don't turn these features off you will mess up the config file.<br><br>Installing the NDK (optional and subject to change as there is little information for the NDK and Monkey-X)<br>Current Version r9c as of Feb 2014<br><a href="https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html" target="_blank">https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html</a><br><br>There is a 32bit and a 64bit download for the NDK.
