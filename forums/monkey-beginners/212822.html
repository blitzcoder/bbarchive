What a concept , using code to setup the paths but computers can't do that can they !!@"@$&amp;!!?????<br><br>Anyway I built "blob" in the examples got 17 warnings but it did build but did not go on iPhone , I'm using the cable that was in the original box<br><br>Incompletely lost ? I have three laptops some targets work on each so I need three laptops to get most working I'm tempted to buy "the other one" (compiler) because of that config file..... I'm sick of this I'm spending money on "the other one" because of the "config file" thing ! I'm happy with monkey when I get it to work. Its the hours wasted on the config , I would pay $200 just to not have to configure it.<br><br>Any time I post it's usually "how do I config this target" the programming is the easy bit. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Then you will find out how expensive owning an Apple product really is. If you are lucky, you may get 10 years out of an iMac. At least with a Windows Desktop I don't have to buy a new machine to what basically amounts to a minor update and compatibility mode is for old software that may have trouble running. I can still run software that that is almost 20 years old on Windows 10 x64. The only software that really gives me grief are those that require 32bit copy protection drivers and some of those that were for Windows 95/98. You would be hard pressed to get software that old to work on an Apple machine unless it was downloaded via the AppStore and only then because those that wish to sell on the AppStore are forced to update for the latest OS. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The last version of OS X that will install is El-Capitan 10.11.6.<br><br>Going by Apples record, as they haven't published any life-cycles for OS X (or any software or other hardware); they support an OS X release for around 4 years with mainstream updates stopping not long after a new release of OS X.

There is a known bug that prevents it from using .LIB files. The easiest solution is to edit the makefile in the gcc_winnt templates and remove both the -L openal/lib in the LDFLASGS section. You still need to have the correct binary version of OpenAL installed for the version of TDM you are using. TDM 64 default it to compile native 64 bit binaries. To compile for 32 bit you have to add the -m32 switch to both CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS in the makefile.<br>See <a href="http://www.monkey-x.com/Community/posts.php?topic=12823" target="_blank">http://www.monkey-x.com/Community/posts.php?topic=12823</a><br><br><div class="quote"> Yeah it's a shame Apple don't backward support really really really OLD hardware ? Shame on Apple ! <br></div>If they did they would go out of business. They are relying on sales of new hardware; it's in their best interests to stop support of hardware after a certain amount of time. They have always claimed to be a hardware manufacture first, not a software company. That's the reason that they always gave when asked during the PowerPC era if the would port their operating systems over to IBM PCs. If it wasn't for the success of the iPhone; then they would still be a niche little computer manufacturing company in a very competitive market. As it is, they have managed to build a nice little ecosystem for themselves around the iDevices, so that you had to use Apple computers and software to write software their products. Microsoft tried to do a similar thing but it didn't turn out too well for them. And by the looks of it there will soon be a flurry of Window 10 bashing going on over at the BlitzBasic site when the new Windows 10 interface is rolled out.<br><br>The biggest worry that a Windows or OS X user should care about, is if both Apple and Microsoft decide to completely lock down their operating systems so that the only way to install software is via their AppStores. If Microsoft did do this; then that would be the final nail in the coffin that they seem to be building for themselves. Apple have come close to it on the ground of system security so they say, but as anyone knows that's a load of BS judging by some of the Applications that have been released on the AppStore. People tend to forget that smart phones are mini computers with phone call functionality and are even more susceptible to the same flaws as an ordinary PC when it come to security. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
