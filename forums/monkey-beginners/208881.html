I have used something of the kind in puzzle games where graphics sometimes need to be pre-generated.  Basically, I call a PregenerateGraphics() method before the Draw() method in the class that uses them.  It checks whether any of the images are set to null, and if so, it generates them using ReadPixels() and WritePixels() - otherwise it simply returns.<br><br>If some pre-generated graphics become obsolete due to a change in window size or layout, I just set the appropriate images to null, and before the next render they will be regenerated.<br><br>You can do the same, just set the images to null in OnCreate()  For your app, it seems to me you would want to create a bunch of differently coloured shapes.

Without a clear definition of the task it's pretty hard to provide a solution though. Throwing up suggestions to have them shot down on the basis of unstated knowledge as to why they'd be unworkable isn't particularly fulfilling. GfK has been given three broad options:<br><br>1. Pre-process images<br>2. Draw and read pixels<br>3. Alter mojo<br><br>Any of these can work. Based on what GfK has provided he wants to click on an screen full of images and know which one he's hit allowing for possible transparent edges and holes. That can be achieved via 1 or 2 by creating 1-bit per pixel collision maps based on alpha threshold and maintaining a z-order collision list for checking against image bounds. Would that be good enough for GfK? It seems not because it requires some more effort and some possible memory overhead over an imagined mojo that provides direct pixel data access. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You need to render it first, then read the values from the "render buffer" into your array. But by doing so you lose the image's original alpha values. Would be so much nicer to have a ReadPixels method on the Image object. I'm investigating the Mojo source code now. Unfortunately, judging by the Javascript code for the HTML5 platform, it would not be as simple as you might think - at least for that platform. Unless I'm misunderstanding something - always a possibility. ;)<br><br><br>Later, I'll update my code so it fills the integer array from a file-loaded image when necessary.<br><br>EDIT: Updated the code in my previous post. Tested on MonkeyX Pro V81a. Works properly on Desktop target (GLFW 2 and GLFW 3) but breaks when trying to modify a pixel on the HTML5 target. No error given. Assuming it's a browser-related x-domain security violation or something like that (since it only happens on a loaded image, not a generated one) but the FireFox console tells me nothing... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
