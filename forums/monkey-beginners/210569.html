Specifically, the main class (the one extended from mojo's App class) doesn't cooperate all too well with the rest of the project.<br><br>It's practically impossible to work with the main class in non-main monkey files. You can import the main file just fine, but you can't modify/read any of the main class' fields and their values. Attempting to do so will only get you an error.<br>For example, the code below would error out around the line in DoStuff() where it attempted to print Thing's A: the parser would claim that the class Test has no such member (or something along those lines).<br><textarea class=codebox name="code" wrap=OFF readonly="true" rows="15" cols="80">

</textarea><br>The parser reports an error along the lines of "B = New Bar"; it claims that type Bar is not found. Didn't even complain when I declared the field as of type Bar, only whenever I used the keyword "New" did it bother.<br><br>In both cases I made sure to check my spelling thoroughly by ctrl+c'ing and ctrl+v'ing the names around, and the errors still popped up.<br><br>Interestingly enough, this seems to happen randomly throughout my projects - not all of them behave in such a way, and not all of them need a workaround for the first problem (although this might be simply because I don't ever try to get something from the main class in that project.)<br><br>I'm really curious as to why this stuff occurs. I've tried out my code on the linux compiler and the windows compiler, and both got the same results.<br><br>Help, anyone? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Although, I'd recommend not trying to use 'Return' like a function. Add a space between the 'Return' keyword and the value you're returning. I'm surprised that even works when spaced like that.<br><br>Anyway, it sounds like your code isn't broken, but your files are. If it's not finding the code between multiple files, it's probably because it can't find the modules you're asking for. Have you tried naming all of the modules using the standard lowercase format? So, something like 'main' instead of 'Main', and 'funx' instead of 'Funx'. The same goes for the imports. This depends on the system, though. Some file systems aren't case sensitive, and some systems do care about it.<br><br>Of course, you also need to make sure all of the modules share the same main directory, or are otherwise added to the module path.<br><br>Either way, those examples seem to work, so I don't think it's an actual code/compilation issue. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Linux is case sensitive as is MonkeyX and as such the file name myclass.monkey and MyClass.monkey with the variables myclass and MyClass are totally different file names and variables. But on Windows and OSX (with case sensitivity off), the file names myclass.monkey and MyClass.monkey would be the same file.<br><br>Tip for the naming of files:<br>Always use lower case letters and don't use the exact character case for the variables and classes.<br>Some legal file name characters on one target are not guaranteed to be legal on another. One example is the use of the minus sign (-). It causes problems with the Flash target. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

What actually matters is the naming and casing of the Import not that actual file name (though file names are important for Linux).<br>On Windows and OSX (with OSX case sensitivity off) the file system would treat Funx.monkey or funx.monkey as the same file, so a file named Funx.monkey would still get imported if you coded <b>Import Funx</b> or <b>Import funx</b>.<br>On Linux the file names are case sensitive, so the Import must match that file name and case exactly.
