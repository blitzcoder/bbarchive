The creator himself says it is fast, because it was made with "real world applications in mind". (atleast from the seminar he spoke he said it)<br><br>But then I started discovering other languages and some are translated like python, and some use libs that use OpenGL. But what if I wanted to make say, Grand Theft Auto 2 clones in Monkey X? What am I looking at in terms of slow down in comparison to C++?<br><br>Does Monkey X have any OpenGL implementations also?<br><br>I just wanted to get into Monkey since I see barely anyone talk about it in game development, they're always bringing up -Unity- (BLOATED), -Game Maker- (BUGGY/BLOATED/PRICEY), -C++- with libs (Syntax causes me brain pain, very typed, very structured. But it compiles to the fastest machine readable code? Same is true for game code?), <br>-Java- (I like the syntax alot. it is like C#, I am still on the fence about it, I have to learn OpenGL and realized if I'm learning OpenGL, wouldnt I get more out of it using SFML/SDL2? and C++? doesnt it also bloat programs? I've played alot of good Java+LWJGL games however..I've always liked the feel of them but I dunno), -Python- (well, pygame seems like a good enough choice, it has poor documentation and sometimes python decides to give me headaches....), etc, etc...<br><br>Anyway, the reason I brought up these other libs/languages is because I had interested in monkey, it reads a bit like python but it is pretty easy to use. I also read on the product page that it actually translate to a faster language? Such as C++/C?. I've been looking at alot of source code and I can read it, and I can understand it and the apps compile down nicely somewhat. But I wanted to know if anyone had any stress tests with alot of images/image manipulations? Like a game such as GTA 2 has. Lots of pedestrians, moving, managing layers of objects. Or a game like XCOM (the first 1) lots of items, customization, unit details, buildings, etc.<br>or how about a RPG game with paperdoll items layered over player/Npc bodies? such as Ultima? <br><br>How has this been for you when it came to just stress testing/large games? Could MonkeyX make a Daggerfall clone? Dwarf Fortress clone? If yes, is it on par with C++ when it comes to rendering capabilities? Can you implement Monkey OpenGL or DirectX ? I'm still learning Monkey but I'm not understanding its true capabilities, but understand that the Syntax and code is very nicely managed. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Lwjgl has issues on some video cards, can cause problems with systems.<br><br>For what it's worth GTA2 was whacked out in C++ with direct x rendering so if you want GTA that's the way to go.

Since it is structured pretty similar to Java, I suspect there is little inefficiency in the translation.  Nevertheless, the Monkey C++ target runs the fastest.  Either would be a LOT faster than Python!<br><br>In terms of scalability and plain coding efficiency, Monkey is probably fine for any project.  Dwarf Fortress, for example, should be no problem.<br><br>However, the graphic and audio libraries that come with it are designed more for portability than efficiency: While you could probably use Monkey for the 'code' part of an AA game, you would certainly be needing to link to external libraries for these, and you might find it easier to use C++ or something where there is more ready-made code,<br><br>If your sights are on replicating an older game like XCom, Ultima 6 or Civ4 I think you could probably do just fine, given the advances in memory and processing power.<br><br>If you're not an experienced game programmer, Monkey has some nice qualities: it's a decent language with built-in graphics libraries, very easy to use for modest projects - and when you're done you can easily put your game in Playstore / web / desktop as you choose. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It would definately save me research I'd have to do when it comes to learning C++ and DirectX. <br>Due to the fact there are some nice qualities for portability and ease of use I'll probably give it a serious go. <br>Do you know if pyro is worth it if I was trying to say build small time retro games: <a href="http://www.playniax.com/pyro.html" target="_blank">http://www.playniax.com/pyro.html</a><br>I was looking at it, and I'm not sure if I should try it WITH Ignition X, or just it by itself because it is actually an updated version of ignition X and has all its functionality. Kind of confusing me.<br><br>besides that, I like the TED IDE, is Jungle really worth it though for saving dev time and speed? It probably has an autocomplete feature for Monkey I'm sure, that alone might make it worth it. I was reading some users had issues but I'm not sure. I would love a paid improved bundled version of what python/pygame should be. And maybe MonkeyX is that for me. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I studied loads of 2d demonstrations and code to see if I could adjust it to make it faster but batching doesnt help if you rotate the sprite apparently.<br><br>2) C++ - I still have my Framework for this and its lightning fast there are some niggles I would like to fix in it but those will be done as I go. Rendering was brilliant and the engine can render 200 sprites (quads with textures) using OpenGL at 60fps :)<br><br>3) MonkeyX 1 using mojo 1 - This is the furthest version of Star Rogue I have so far its rendering 200 sprites for nebula etc, background, NPC's, weapons fire, stellar objects and GUI stuff all at 60fps.<br><br>Says it all really, now im not saying Unity is bad at what it does but as had been said before if your used to coding a certain way then it can be a chore to learn the new styles. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
