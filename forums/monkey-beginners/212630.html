</pre><br><br>Does "Merge" cover a binary which is compiled as stand alone in a form that does not actually include the software in its original form? <br>Such as an application which makes use of 10 libraries, and includes this one library, but does not include source code?<br><br>It doesn't say. To me, this doesn't clearly state anything in regards to how things are merged.<br><br>It clearly does say "USE". And this is very clear, if you include it in a header/file, you have just used it.<br> Beyond protecting the already protected copyright of the copyright holder. I have no idea how you give proper notice with a MIT licensed library along side your own copyrighted source code... which also might include 10 other libs, all under different libraries.  Especially if it can only be statically linked (which is the case of Monkey/Monkey2 libs?)<br><br>Anyway, enough of my thoughts, I wanted to know in concrete forms how most of you developers dealt with this issue, the problem for me is not about "giving credit", or proper notice of the originals author's "merged" or "used"(included) work, the problem for me is I don't want people mixing up the rights of whatever I made, with whatever this license said in regards to what was used/merged and I'm not even sure about the specifics of sub-license usage rights.. <br><br><br>For example:<br><br>Bob The Dev: Buy my game, its made using the MIT licensed lib NewLib9000_MIT!<br>Tom The Gamer: Yo this license says I can do what I want with your game, cuz Im dumb!<br>Bob The Dev: ......... .. . ... .. . ... . ... . .... *dies*<br><br>which doesnt matter, but if you read the license, and you put this license next to your product, and it says you can sublicense it, but if you use the software you have to include the original license, why isnt this written clearly? See this is why I prefer the zlib license. Very clear.<br><br><br><pre class=code>

The MIT licence isn't considered to be 'viral' like the GPL, ie. you're not required to open up the source to your binary-only distributions, so if you're not distributing the source code from the MIT-licensed software distribution, you wouldn't be required to provide the licence text -- it wouldn't make any sense if you're only distributing your binary version, given that MIT isn't viral and doesn't enforce source distribution.<br><br>The main answer here seems to agree:<br><br><a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/255227/meaning-of-mit-license" target="_blank">http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/255227/meaning-of-mit-license</a><br><br>... but I agree, now that you point it out, it is surprisingly open to interpretation on this point, and the zlib licence does indeed make it much clearer.<br><br>The way I read MIT, though, is that the original software distribution is what the licence refers to as "this software", so redistribution of that software (whether that's source and/or binaries) refers to that original set of files; therefore, if you distribute their (modified/unmodified) source or binaries you need to provide the licence text with that source or binary code.<br><br>Definitely vague, though. No idea if MIT has been tested in court...<br><br>"I am not a lawyer." <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

</pre><br><br><br>and as long as you ship this notice with your original software you are protected by the MIT license, since it clearly states the notice can never be removed..<br>.. I wouldnt place this at the base level of your app otherwise users may get funny ideas on its use.<br><br>Then again "The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.", I don't even want to begin to guess what a "substantial portion of the Software" is, because that can literally mean anything.
