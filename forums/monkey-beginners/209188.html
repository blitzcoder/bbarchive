You should probably just make that list a field in your 'Game' class. That's assuming you're not planning on completely restructuring this, which I'd also recommend. For an example, this is fine, but for a full game engine, this will get cluttered. Also, the forum codes are on the bottom right. For some reason they don't pop up when making a thread, though. You should use 'codebox' for large amounts of code, and 'code' for small amounts. These can be used via the usual BBCode symbols ([INSERTHERE]), and they should be ended with that, only with a slash before the code-type ([/INSERTHERE]). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

They should be useful for structural references. Just keep in mind they're supposed to be somewhat self-contained. Here's <a href="https://github.com/Regal-Internet-Brothers/modules" target="_blank">my modules, for example</a>.<br><br>As for game structure, you should probably stay far away from global variables, and instead use fields and constructors. Unless of course you're dealing with something shared, like an 'Image', then globals <i>could</i> work. I personally wrote an elaborate wrapper for Mojo's 'Image' functionality, which reuses the actual 'Image' objects automatically. From there I just extend my custom image class with my sprite class, and I have sprites held within game-objects.<br><br>My game-objects are held within other game-objects (Usually sharing a common ancestor), which all gets contained up to the scene, then the scene-manager (Both are still game-objects, mind you) holds each scene. From there, I can pretty easily implement synchronization routines for online multiplayer, as I just need to write standard serialization routines for the objects. And since the multiplayer-game is handled by the scene-manager, I can technically synchronize anything with a bit of code (If the base-class's implementation doesn't already do the job). And of course, I simply make a new scene-manager when starting the game, and handle that in my main 'Game' class (Which is based on Mojo's 'App' class).<br><br>So, that's a very basic look at the layout of my game engine(s). I also have somewhat complicated systems that deal with draw-order and cameras (Which use <a href="https://github.com/Regal-Internet-Brothers/autofit" target="_blank">my sub-display system</a> for split-screen and the like). There's also my 'inputmanager' module, which I'm planning on releasing soon. As well as other modules I've made (But haven't released yet), such as my argument-loading framework. And don't even get me started on the messes that are my ID-system, collision routines, and relational quad-trees.<br><br>The only problem I have with this structure is that my menus are scene and scene-manager based. This means I have to create a new scene manager for the menus, then create a new manager for gameplay. It's really not that big of a deal, though.<br><br><b>Anyway, what I described is more or less my engine in a nutshell. Needless to say, I like writing everything from scratch (Other than a few small things here and there), as well as have things containing similar things inside of them for the sake of standardization. Not to mention object synchronization.</b> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
