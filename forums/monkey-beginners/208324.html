I got the Android version up and running in about 2 days.<br><br>For the Iphone version, I had to go buy a new Iphone5c and a new Macbook Pro. Within 6 hours, I had everything set up and the game running on my Iphone.<br><br>This is exactly what I was hoping for and to think it only cost some pocket change that ultimately saved me weeks (months?) of learning how to port an android game over to the iphone.<br><br>Very well done and I thank you guys for this!! <br><br>Now to figure out how to publish these over to the stores!<br>:) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I think it released somewhere around 2004/2005. I bought it soon after I had the money for it. I LOVED (and still do) BlitzMAX! Monkey-X is equally awesome - although I had to get used to Monkey-X ways vs BlitzMAX ways.<br><br>I've always enjoyed the idea that I could write the code once and with little or no changes, have it compile and perform nearly equal on ALL supported platforms. OUYA was a fine addition to the Monkey-X target set since I've purchased Monkey-X. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Now days you can look at deploying games written for desktops or laptops across quite a few Suppliers like Steam, but a few years ago I got into Flash and Java for the purpose of deploying across the web. Who knows, someday I may even venture back to Blitzmax, but right now I am looking for my best chance to make something sellable so I can stop unclogging toilets for a living!<br><br>:) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That was a hair pulling experience! Took me about 6 hours to finally get the icons right in Xcode so it would stop kicking out errors. I had to change the target to 6 from 4.3 and use the icon assets catalog. Otherwise, trying to get the naming correct was impossible. <br><br>Android was definitely a lot simpler. Took me less than an hour to get that through and it got put on the store right away. Of course, I had to upload 2 newer versions right away because of mistakes, lol. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
