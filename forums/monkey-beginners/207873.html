What you are asking will help BRL and their product alone and not at all helping us or our products. <br><br>In fact it does the complete opposite of helping us we should have the right to choose whether to advertise what our games were made with.

This only applied to GameMaker 8.1 and below which were all windows only. Both GameMaker for Mac and the latest version, called GameMaker:Studio, even the lite version of Studio, these don't force unwanted logos anymore, heck, they don't have an opening loading bar anymore, either, it opens the actual game window instantaneously, YoYoGames did this because they realized forced branding is not a good idea at all. <br><br>And why add a loading bar if Monkey games open just fine, instantaneously, the main game window? It's like making a loading bar that keeps people waiting even though there's nothing technically being loaded or rational to wait for, because everything already loads in like a milisecond on startup. Why intentionally make our games slower? Where's the point in that?<br><br>Just because it's a common practice doesn't make it a good practice.
