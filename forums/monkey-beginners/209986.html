Have been using Unity for about 20 months now and keep thinking it is way overkill for 2D games.<br><br>So I started looking for alternatives and document my findings on my site: <a href="http://garsgames.com/blog/game-development/testing-2d-game-development-systems/" target="_blank">http://garsgames.com/blog/game-development/testing-2d-game-development-systems/</a><br><br>Obviously, I am down to Monkey X now. Only been using it a couple days and so far I like it a lot.<br><br>Just curious what the best tile-map engine is for Monkey X?<br><br>Sure I can easily knock out one. In fact I already have as can be seen on the Monkey X page on my site. However, I've read about a Tiled map loader and also other things such as the Diddy module.<br><br>Just curious which is the easiest (quickest) to work with? Really all I want is just the most basic stuff. Being able to design my levels (so some kind of basic editor), loading the map data into Monkey X program, displaying it, being able to "read" a map cell and change the tile residing in a map cell. Anything more is just extra baggage that I won't have a use for.<br><br>Is there something like this available or should I just knock it out myself? Basically, I don't want to reinvent the wheel and this is why I am asking.<br><br>Thanks! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I think it would be helpful if there was a manual or some kind of documentation for it. I went through all of the code in an attempt to understand it.

I will have to mess around with it more and see how scrolling is handled and so forth but looks great so far!<br><br>A couple things: I have hit that rebuild documentation button many times now and nothing ever changes. I see no documentation for any modules I have downloaded. In fact under help there is NO "modules" item even displayed. I do notice during the rebuild of the documentation it always mentions missing link for 3rd party modules. Maybe it is a Pro only feature.<br><br>Here is a screenshot:<br><img src="http://garsgames.com/MonkeyXDemos/Screenshots/RebuildHelpConsole.png"><br><br>So, I don't know what is going on. I keep thinking maybe there is more to using Monkey X than I am aware of. Like maybe I need to manually be editing some config file or something.<br><br>Also, it is very odd this forum does not have a simple reply button/link to easily reply to a specific post. I get that most of us are probably "old school" around here but still this simple feature would make using the forum a lot simpler and certainly help any new people to not be turned off so fast. Having to copy and paste in the Quote code seems pretty antiquated. lol <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

However, tiled is really powerful in that it's all right there and the xml files are easy to edit by hand. (I found adding 50 properties is a whole lot faster by hand than in tiled!)<br><br>And while I don't think the xml layout for tiled was well thought out, it is thought out enough to be extremely powerful and easy to use (they made some technically boneheaded calls, like ordering things from the top to the bottom when the XML spec allows for loading out of order, or creating child elements when none are really needed). You can place tiles and objects. Tiles and objects each can have a list of as many properties as you like (these are stringmaps). So between stringmaps for any particular tile and objects, you can encode a ton of stuff. I can set position and rotation for objects on the map, set the object's images and animation data, set its physics, and have it all in one human readable map file. You can just about store all the game parameters in a map file and just have your program process all the properties!<br><br>One thing I've done is I wanted box collision for a project, so I loaded a "collision" tileset and made images so I could see my collision boxes in the editor. I don't render these in the game engine. To check for collision, I encoded the collision area as tileset properties. So now anytime I place a specific tile down, the engine knows that a small section of that tile is a collision box, and the image I have in the editor matches it. With tiled I can then turn on and off my collision layer so I can edit with or without seeing my collision areas. I also use this for zones. Instead of blocking on a collision tile, I just process what's supposed to happen when a player goes in an area.<br><br>Tiled is easily the best map editor I've ever come across! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Method SetTileValue:Void(x:Int, y:Int, tileID:Int)
    DataResource[y * Self.Parent.Width + x] = tileID
End
</pre><br><br>Just figured I'd let you know in case you wanted to make the update on your end and post in your github.<br><br>I am sure this would be useful to many people because it is pretty common to update the map perhaps unblocking an entrance or like in my case I activate "light up" check point markers as the player reaches them. For a new game, I scan the map and change any lit checkpoint markers back to unlit checkpoint markers and so forth. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You can kinda do different sized layers with tiled by loading and rendering two different maps simultaneously. Everything else you described is already there. The memory footprint is very low unless you use all the features :) It grows basically along with your map size. You're right though, there's nothing like the freedom of your own engine. I wouldn't recommend tiled or any of our tiled modules until you've created your own maps so you understand what is what.<br><br>To Gar, I'm currently rewriting the engine and will make sure I have a number of functions including your suggestion to assist with realtime map editing. I may also include an export function down the road that I'm sure will be useful. I'm another week or two away from completing it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

These days there are so many good options available there really is no reason to roll your own. It also makes it so there are some standards. Like if everyone was using one of the popular map editors such as Tiled then it becomes very easy to swap maps, allow players to make maps for games and so forth without everyone needing to learn a custom editor for each game.<br><br>There is some good learning to be had in making map editors and such and I did that a lot 20 years ago.

Yeah I can understand that. I used to do the same thing. Mainly because they are so straightforward to knock out AND you can customize it the way you want.<br>The last real full featured map editor I made was actually back on the Amiga in Blitz. It supported up to 3 or 4 I forget which map layers because at the time I figured I would never need more than that. And it also supported an object marker layer (for identifying zones for collisions, entering areas, triggering events, etc) and an item/enemy layer.<br><br>The greatest advantage with rolling your own was to make it so it can handle everything you need because map editors used to be pretty basic "back in the day". I almost created one for this test game (actually at first I started to just hard-code the map).<br><br>Decided to look around and see if any of the modern map editors had increased the standard features and was very happy to see they do. They are very well done these days to support games with support for objects and so forth.
