Another problem is most of the targets are impossible to load correctly even when I using jungle.  It's kind of frustrating when things like this happen;  what if I can't get it to work the way I want it to?  I wasted all this time leaning a language that only monkey uses.  why was it coded this way?  Why not use C, C++,C#, or java.  I am seriously thinking about going back to game maker or jumping to  cocos-2d-js . I had no problem coding in game maker and I accomplished as much in one week as I did in a month and a half using monkey, because of GameMakers easy programming language with readily available easy to use function plus their fantastic documentation. At the very least I was learning a language almost identical to java.  could someone tell me reasons why I should stick with monkey?   The only advantage I see that it has over game maker is that it is better structured for making large scaled games and  its inexpensive targets which (for the most part) I can't seem to get working anyways. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I would not use anything else. We publish commercially and have games on Steam.<br><br>doug, learning to program in general terms is more useful than mastering a single language. The more you learn how to be a good programmer the better your prospects can be, and the more quickly you can pick up other languages. Don't feel time practicing new things as a waste- at a high level all concepts you grasp in one language will help you understand other languages faster. It sounds to me like you need to devote more time into learning everything programming wise, perhaps you should study some general programming books and not focus on a single language for a while. What are your goals? What do you want to be doing?<br><br>If you want to get better at programming in general so that you do not have to think of how to do things but what to do, then you need to invest more time into studying programming concepts in general, as well as techniques and design patterns specific to games. If you want some book recommendations I can give you some, but you should state your goals first too. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It was also really hard to manage everything unless you have been using it for years.  I had used it for 3 or 4 months. The problem with game maker is when I  hit a spot were something was majorly wrong  I had to start from the beginning because if you change one thing it effects everything; it had very poor compartmentalization.  If I was making a small scale game I would have never left game maker because it is fantastic at making small to medium sized 2d games.  And yes I tired Unity but the add-ons are too expensive for me plus it had a lot of unnecessary overhead because it is designed mainly for 3d capabilities.  so I narrowed it down to monkey or cocos.  I chose monkey over cocos for two secondary reason: house keeping- I did not want to deal with it, and the amount of targets that monkey could access at a low price. (I should have know that the low price meant that using these targets would be extremely difficult with very limited or poor documentation.  if I Knew how difficult it would be to use these targets I would went with cocos because I could already communicate with my android phone a little while after installing cocos on my computer.   But, the main reason I chose monkey was I thought it would eventually speed up game development,  but it hasn't. it gives me unexplainable errors  that I never encountered with gameMaker or even visual studios and I just got stated using this program.<br> soap: I disagree.  I have been programming along with doing electronic design for over 20 years and for a non photographic memory-type guy I found it better to stick to one medium of programming.  Unless programming is all that you are interested in (which I am not.  I am also an artist, and handing the different tasks of programming along with the difficult (yet less appreciated task) of the artist is too much to deal with (check out some of my work at <a href="http://comicfury.com/comicprofile.php?url=superHeroComic" target="_blank">http://comicfury.com/comicprofile.php?url=superHeroComic</a> especially if I also need to know a bunch of  different programming languages .C type languages is clearly what most programmers use so that is the only one I would really want to use under ideal circumstances which made it very difficult for me to even consider using monkey in the first place. Anyways thanks for your inputs and unless I can figure out how to make all of the targets work I think I will go to cocos or back to game maker.  At least I can make a simple windows game in game maker or make a game that I can output to my android phone in cocos. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There are many programmers here too, maybe you can collaborate with one of them to make a project with each of you focusing on your strengths. What specific problems did you have with the targets and which ones were problems for you? It sounds like getting the Android target to work is the problem?<br><br>You may already do this, but if you use "site:monkey-x.com search terms" you can find many problems you can face already have solutions discussed by others here. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

A lot of the same stuff you deal with here though will be present in cocos2d.<br><br>doug:  Use the call stack from your error to find the code block where the index is going out of range.  That should help you pinpoint where things are going amiss, or at least point you in the right direction.

I have bought a couple of books for it in the years but I never really started using it, So confused about that language. Monkey translates to it. Javascript has those html buttons and such.  Java which I chose over monkey in 2011 I stopped using when the Applets security problems started and oracle messed things up I guess. One day my applets on my blog just stopped working. I had example game code on it an the example applet to show it off. I really had a great time with Java until it broke. I would still be using it if I could post working applets on blogger. I now also have no blog hosting solution for javascript/html5 games atm.<br><br>Monkey in 2011 I only reasearched a short time. I though it was not good enough then. To used to Blitz3d. The graphical improvements like transparancy and rotation I did not notice then.  I started programming in Monkey a few months ago and so far so good, so happy with the rotation and transparancy features now.  I have not touched another language after I started in Monkey.  I bought Blitzmax with Monkey-X and only viewed several examples for blitzmax.<br><br>The Monkey forum got quite filled with examples and solutions and if I ask something I quickly get help so the lesser documentation is not that much of a problem. The only thing that anoys me is that compilation time is so much longer then blitz 3d/+ But maybe I should get a faster computer :)<br><br>So I think that I will be using Monkey for a longer period. I am already preparing larger projects with it. Will do this when I get more experienced with the language.<br><br>Monkey also has a good lite editor going for it. Jcreator for Java that I used and liked a lot did not work on windows 8. For javascript/html5 I have not found a good lite editor yet,<br><br>Give Monkey a chance.

Java was a great toolset to work with and I like their rectangle intersect feature (aka collision detection), but when i discovered Monkey, I haven't looked back since. For one, I like how my games can be made without someone having to download extra software because it can convert to other languages like Javascript (a language which I also used). I also enjoy this forum. When I need help with something, I could easily get help with it vs. when I was using Java, I had to comb through a bunch of sites and didn't always get a straight answer. Thus, it might take a moment to learn Monkey, and once you learn it, you'll get faster with it. And this message is coming from me whom is a beginner, I suck at programming and I don't always know what I'm doing! But yet, I was able to pick up Monkey and make some games fairly quickly in it.

Being stuck at an ugly (mostly non-understandable) bug is frustrating. Also, as being a beginner with Monkey (though coding since 1984) I cannot even state that it is not a bug in Monkey or Ignition. Any tool or framework could be buggy, we are all humans at the end of the day, even being coders :-).<br><br>What I think, that being more of an artist-guy, you should really take Game Maker instead. GM is excellent for non-coders (and also great for coders, I was selling GM officially in my country between 2005-2010, until YoYo took over). I do not agree also on that no big project can be managed in GM. :-) (big is a relative word, no GTA VI, for sure)<br><br>Monkey-X is excellent, but regarding my experience with game making tools (since Simon's Basic on C64 to Unity 5), it is not for beginners. You have to have at least the basic concepts of our profession: coding. Without them, since Monkey is an advanced, OO language, you'll have millions of the above frustrating bugs. And without proper experience in coding, it is going to be close to impossible to overcome a bug like that. Even if it were in the framework you might have a workaround, but even that needs experience.<br><br>So, have a beer (or any relaxation), and use a tool that was designed for your experience. Heads up!<br>Cheers, Peter <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
