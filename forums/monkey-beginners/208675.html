Just look at some of the 3rd party tools like Jungle IDE, IgnitionX, Diddy, and Fantom. And there are some great modules to be found scattered throughout the forums. Luckily Ziggy is taking it upon himself to help organize that mess.<br><br>As far as I'm concerned, Monkey is a great language and while it's future development is uncertain, they're many who will do their best to keep it alive and prosperous.

And thats something that can be easily addressed. <br><br>The first thing is to define the scope of Monkey. Many people want it to do many things and that is impossible for Mark to do all himself. In my opinion, Monkey's strength is in 2D gaming. If 3d is needed then people can either create a 3d addon or use Unity.<br><br>Next is the Ide. Luckily there are several solutions for free and pay. <br><br>Next up are the solutions for collisions, particles, touch detection, scaling, etc. Once again the community has provided various solutions. Diddy, Ignition, Fantom, and other mods for scaling, touch control, etc. <br><br>Next up is documentation and examples. While the docs are OK, the examples need some love, unless your using Diddy, Fantom, or ignition which all have nice examples and ignition docs are great. <br><br>Lastly, all of this needs to be tied together so people can find it. Sites like unity and Cocos have a nicely organized site with everything easy to find. Mark simply doesn't have the time for this, but we can do it as a community. <br><br>If we could just organize what already exists, Monkey would be far more appealing to new customers. <br><br>An example of what I, as a new customer like to see, would be similar to the ignitionx/playniax website. They really showcase what's possible with Monkey and their docs/examples are great. Add on a good Ide (like jentos, or jungle) and we're halfway there. <br><br>I've seen many people complain about the name Monkey or the cute picture. I think playniax.com makes it look awesome.<br> <br>Am I nuts or does anyone agree? <br><br>Keep up the great work Mark! <br><br>gasmonso <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I also had loads of questions about the language (because in my eagerness to get started, I hadn't even noticed the "documentation" link at the bottom of the website). Every time I posted a question, I got multiple helpful answers. I now have a game that's up and running, with surprisingly little code, and running on five platforms. <br><br>Is the future of Monkey assured? No, of course not. Anything can fold at any time. But a game you write today will still run on most platforms for several years, even as they are updated. You don't need to be targeting the absolute latest version of any platform, unless there are very specific features in that latest version you want, and in that case, you're probably not targeting cross-platform development anyway.<br><br>I tried Unity for a while - if you want 3d it's awesome, but I found their 2d implementation hard to understand and it felt shoehorned in.  I've also written a working version of my game in Cocos with C++, and the learning curve is a LOT steeper (see my note below) even for me with 25 years of C++ experience. There wasn't any significant benefit writing in Cocos compared to Monkey, but I will say that while the community was good at answering questions, they weren't as friendly as people here.<br><br>So it's up to you, especially with your financial constraints, but I would say that the advantages of Monkey vastly outweigh the (possible) issues with future development.<br><br><br><div class="quote"> Cocos have a nicely organized site with everything easy to find <br></div><br><br>I beg to differ - their API documentation, while complete, is out of date, and most of it is automatically generated by a script from the source files, so it contains very little info on how to actually do anything.  Plus, many of the tutorials out there are way out of date and simply don't work any more due to language features being deprecated, and again, the documentation tells you they are deprecated but gives no indication of what they're replaced with. I found it enormously frustrating, and ultimately, didn't find anything I couldn't achieve in Monkey one way or another. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Also bought Giderosmobile 1-year subscription, which would cost more on the long term and uses a 2d scene graph which I dislike.<br><br>Monkey X comes without DRM, there's no activation needed. So in theory what could stop is really only the further development of Monkey X itself. But I see it more as framework anyway, a framework-creator, actually Monkey has a very good design. Just see it like a book. You buy a book, it could get outdated some day, but what you pay for is what you learn and what you can keep. Just like SLotman said, with Monkey you can create games which will be completely self-contained and open source. So there's no danger at all on the technical side.<br><br>And how well other products sell, who knows. I've come to the conclusion from a support ticket that I *might be Gideros customer number 303 (in mid 2013). 303 buys * $149 for a few years of work, that would be low. And there's plenty of other software with developers that generate no big income, but it doesn't mean you'll get a problem with their software.
