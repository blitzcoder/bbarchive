A Class is a namespace:</b><br><br>A class is a piece of code, that works independent of other code. You can use variable names twice without colliding with the other variable names:<br><br>[monkeycode]Global A%<br><br>Class MyGame<br>     Global A%<br>End[/monkeycode]<br><br>So it is very helpful to encapsul "modules" of yours game, that you may use in more than one game inside classes. F.e. you can use your "licence" class or a  "translation" class in all your projects.<br><br><br><b>2. A Class is a sort of TYPE</b><br>You can also see classes like a user defined variable type. In this case a class descripes a bunch of variables descriping a actor in a game:<br>[monkeycode]Class EnemyClass<br>     Field X%, Y%, Pic:Image, Energy#, Name$<br>End[/monkeycode]<br>This offers you the chance to define your own "variables" which have more properties then only store one integer number:<br>[monkeycode]Enemy1:EnemyClass= New EnemyClass<br>Enemy1.X=45<br>Enemy1.Y=500<br>Enemy1.Pic=LoadImage(...<br>Enemy1.Energy=100<br>Enemy1.Name="Thor"[/monkeycode]<br>To use such a user defined type you will create new "instances" of your type.<br>[monkeycode]Enemy1:EnemyClass= New EnemyClass<br>Enemy2:EnemyClass= New EnemyClass<br>[/monkeycode]<br>You can compare this with creating two INTEGER variables:<br>[monkeycode]A:INT= New INT<br>A=45<br>B:INT= New INT<br>B=90[/monkeycode]<br> Using the keyword "Field" in the definition (above) means, that you can use X% as often as you want without colliding with other instances of your type.<br>[monkeycode]Enemy1:EnemyClass= New EnemyClass<br>Enemy1.X=45<br>Enemy2:EnemyClass= New EnemyClass<br>Enemy2.X=90[/monkeycode]<br><br><b>3. Using instances</b><br>You now can use this instances as a whole:<br>[monkeycode]Enemy1:EnemyClass= New EnemyClass<br>Enemy1.X=45<br>Enemy2:EnemyClass= New EnemyClass<br>Enemy2.X=90<br>Enemy2=Enemy1<br>Print Enemy2.X[/monkeycode]<br>This is corresponding to<br>[monkeycode]A:INT=1<br>B:INT=2<br>B=A<br>Print B[/monkeycode] <br><br><b>4. Functions</b><br>Those Classes can have functions inside, that work independent from functions with the same name outside.<br><br>[monkeycode]Class EnemyClass<br>     Global CommonImage:Image<br>     Field X%, Y%, Pic:Image, Energy#, Name$<br><br>     Function LoadOneImage(File$)<br>          CommonImage=LoadImage(File$)<br>     End<br><br>     Function CreateOne:EnemyClass(X%,Y%,Name$)<br>          Local loc:EnemyClass= New EnemyClass<br>          loc.X=X<br>          loc.Y=Y<br>          loc.Pic=CommonImage<br>          loc.Energy=100<br>          loc.Name=Name<br>          Return loc<br>     End<br>End[/monkeycode]<br>The first function will load a GLOBAL image will can be accessed by all instances of the Class. The second function will create a instance and fill the fields with values, then return this instance back to the main program. The main program would look like this:<br><br>[monkeycode]EnemyClass.LoadOneImage("test.png")<br>Enemy1=EnemyClass.CreateOne(45,500,"Thor")[/monkeycode]<br><br><b>5. Methods</b><br>Methods are "functions" that belong to one instance of the Class. The Method can access only the fields of "its" instance:<br><br>[monkeycode]Class EnemyClass<br>     Global CommonImage:Image<br>     Field X%, Y%, Pic:Image, Energy#, Name$<br><br>     Method Move(Direction%)<br>           X=X+Direction <br>     End<br>End[/monkeycode]<br><br>You can call this Method to change values of one Enemy:<br>[monkeycode]Enemy1:EnemyClass= New EnemyClass<br>Enemy1.X=45<br>Repeat<br>     Enemy1.Move(-1)<br>Until....<br>[/monkeycode]<br><br><br>Ask, if you want to know more.... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

When you're working on one part of your code, you can forget all about the classes/things you're not interested in, instead of scrolling over them or jumping around.

Class Box

End
</pre><br><br>Now, you need to know specific things about this box. What size is it, in Height, Width and Length. Perhaps you need to know about its color or what type of material it is made up of. These are known as Properties. In Monkey, a "Property" is called a "Field".<br><br><pre class=code>

A Function is special type of Method that can perform actions using the properties and methods within the Class.

Additionally, you can calculate the volume for a box without needing to create the box.<br><br>If you want to create an instance of a class and define its fields at the same time, you need to pass a New() Method.

Furthermore, you don't want to make an instantiated object to access at them. What can you do?<br><br>You COULD make a bunch of functions stuck in a source file that has global access by all parts of your code. Sure this would work, but its very messy. This resembles spaghetti code where functions are tossed about and there's no easy way of sifting through it all. How would you know what belongs with what? What if you have several functions that do similar tasks? How do you know easily which one is the perfect fit for what you are trying to achieve?<br><br>Examples:<br>Draw()<br>DrawPlayer()<br>DrawEnemies()<br>DrawWeapons()<br>DrawItems()<br>etc...<br><br>It doesn't seem so bad, but you will have one HUGE file and after a while it will be very hard to read through.<br><br>You COULD make a class that groups their functionality together. So you put all the functions that are closely related together, and now you access them by the class name (which would be named something appropriate towards the functionality it contains) followed by a "." and then the function call. You won't need to instantiate the class, but now you'd easily know what its doing and where its found,<br><br>Consider this:<br>Using the non-class structured function:<br>Render()<br><br>Using a class structured function:<br>Engine.Render()<br><br>JUST from the glance, can you tell me what the first one does vs the second one? Really, they both RENDER, but what exactly would you expect each Render and Engine.Render() to be rendering? <br><br>These area rhetorical questions, but ones you need to make when you design your apps. How can you design the app so its easy to understand and maintain?<br><br>Consider the Visual Studio .NET frameworks. I'm not sure how familiar you are with this, but they use the same concept there. Classes such as String provide BOTH instantiated and un-instantiated parts. Forgive me as its been eons since I've actually written Visual Basic.NET code. <br><pre class=code>
Dim strString as String = "I am a string"
Print strString
Print String.Length(strString) 
Print String.Compare("Test","This")
</pre><br>The point here is that everything within the String class pertains to the String OBJECT. You will not find anything outside of dealing with a string contained within the functionality, be it a function or a method that doesn't have relevancy with a String.<br><br>Additionally, I haven't discussed SCOPE. Scope will be a key thing here. When you want to black-box code, you will want some functions public while others are private. All Functions in a class can call the other functions to the same class without referencing the class itself.<br><br>While you CAN just stick to using methods in classes and making it where you need to create instances of them to get to their methods, you can make it simpler on you by also providing functions to help you along the way that BELONG to what the class is intended for. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Amazing how I can forget all this stuff when I don't use it.<br><br>Here are my questions, functions in a class cannot access the fields of the class unless:<br><br>1) the field is set to global inside the class ?<br><pre class=code>
Class EnemyClass
     Global CommonImage:Image
     Field X%, Y%, Pic:Image, Energy#, Name$

     Function LoadOneImage(File$)
          CommonImage=LoadImage(File$)
     End
</pre><br><br>2) is CommonImage still considered a Field of the class event though it's not proceeded by the Field keyword ?<br><br>3) a function does though have access to fields of the instance of the object that is calling it ?<br><br><br>Again this is so weird that I have forgotten most of this.  I had an app I was working on that mimicked the scoring mechanism of Matching With Friends.  I was using Classes, Methods and Functions then.  Then my computer bit the dust and I left it all behind for nearly a year.  <br><br>Please help get me back up to speed guys.  Thanks !! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The difference is that its somewhat locked in to the containing class. you can access it from outside the class by preceding it with the class name. in your example like this:<br><pre class=code>
 EnemyClass.CommonImage = LoadImage(file)
</pre><br>or with the instance of of the class:<br><pre class=code>
local enemy:EnemyClass = New EnemyClass
enemy.CommonImage = LoadImage(file)
</pre><br>But within the class, you don't need to add the prefix to it and no matter how many times you create an instance of the Class, the global will keep it's single instance.<br>the Globals and Const are the only ones you don't need to create an instance of them to have access to them from outside the Class, from Methods and/or  functions.<br><br>In your example every time you call the function to "LoadOneImage", it will store the image in the same Global variable "CommonImage". if you call it more than once from different instances of the class, the image will just be replace by the image last loaded. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
