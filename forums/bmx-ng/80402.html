<table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr ><td class="posthead"><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr ><td >Brucey</td><td align="right"><font class=tiny>(Posted 2008)</font>&nbsp;<a href="#1">[#1]</a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr ><td class="posttext"> <b>The following is presumed *very early beta* and is subject to change at any time!</b><br><br>*ADVANCED USE ONLY* :-p<br><br>Imagine, if you will, a BMK that allowed you to add extra functionality to it without having to modify BMK itself. Perhaps you'd like to post-process some files after your build.<br>How about the ability to add build-changing commands into the source itself?<br><br>Well, that's what's been going on over here at Brucey Central recently, mostly because I've got two modules on hold as BMK as it currently stands needs work to support them properly.<br><br>Up to the plate steps, BMK NG. The same backwards compatible BMK, with a dash of Lua integration.<br><br>* <b>What does it need to run.</b><br><br><u>Everything is included in the Zip.</u><br><br> - Some new modules : Pub.Lua and BRL.MaxLua<br><i>(Before you get too excited, the names and locations are only proposals, but who knows.... maybe one day.)</i><br><br> - And of course, the bmk files.<br><br>* <b>What are those core.bmk and make.bmk files?</b><br><br>These need to be dropped (along with your bmk exe) into the bin dir. They are script files that BMK uses to define certain functionality.<br>If you were to look into these file you would see something like :<br><pre class=code>
@define echo
	print(arg0)
@end
</pre><br>This defines the name of a function/command, along with some Lua code to execute. In this case we've defined a function called "echo" which will print the contents of the rest of the line passed to it.<br><br>To execute the command, we could simply, in the *same* file, add the line :<br><pre class=code>
echo Hey, is this cool or what?
</pre><br>which, when processed by BMK would output to the console that text.<br><br>Okay, not a very exciting example? Now, what if we wanted to include another .bmk script file as part of our build? Well, we have a command for that :<br><pre class=code>
@define include
	bmk.LoadBMK(arg1)
@end
</pre><br>You could use it like so:<br><pre class=code>
include "resources/create_stuff.bmk"
</pre><br>This would cause the file to be loaded, parsed, and if inline commands exist, executed, before moving on to the next line in the current file. We call this, extensibility ;-)<br><br>* <b>What's that bmk.LoadBMK() thing all about?</b><br>In this case, "bmk" is an object, and LoadBMK is a method of that object. In fact, this is calling *into* BMK itself. Currently there are a few different objects exposed :<br> * bmk - some internal methods.<br> * sys - provides access to BRL.FileSystem and BRL.System functionality.<br> * utils - access to BRL.MaxUtil functionality.<br> * globals - a global variable resource/stack. Used extensively for tracking build options and other useful things.<br><br>Other than what's in the code, there's no specific documentation yet, as things change often.<br><br>* <b>How do we use variables?</b><br>You can define a variable on-the-fly...<br><pre class=code>
myname=Brucey
echo %myname%
</pre><br>You can use variables within function definitions<br><pre class=code>
@define test
  if %myname% == "Brucey" then
    print("Hi there!")
  end
@end
</pre><br>Yes, that's Lua. What actually happens during script loading is that the script is processed and any variables are transformed into Lua-friendly code.<br>You can also use global environment variables with the same syntax. For example %path% would equate to the current system PATH environment variable. (you can use upper or lower case).<br><br>* <b>You mentioned adding commands to the source?</b><br>That's right!<br>In your BlitzMax source, you can include @bmk pragmas, which can call any of the previously defined functions. These act just like a line in a script file, except you precede it with @bmk.<br>A little example : (edited to fix typo)<br><pre class=code>
SuperStrict

' @bmk echo *** Building my cool app ***
' @bmk include "my_own_scripts.bmk"
'
' @bmk push cc_opts
' @bmk addccopt -DSPECIAL_OPTION
'
' @bmk make "src/someglue.cpp"
'
' @bmk pop cc_opts
' @bmk make "src/other.cpp"
'
</pre><br>The "push" command saves the current state of a variable, allowing you to make modification to it, after which time you can "pop" it back to its old state. Handy for on-the-fly tweaks :-)<br><br>Again, the push and pop commands are defined like the others - in the script files.<br><br>* <b>Can we do post build stuff?</b><br>Sure, just add a "post.bmk" file into the same dir as your app, and it will be loaded after completion of the compilation stage, but before execution (if you chose to Run it). This can be useful if you want to copy files into an App Bundle, or run the exe through some compression utility, for example.<br><br><br>Anyhoo, that's all for now.<br>Remember, this is just for fun at the moment, and things are likely to change as time goes on, but it's working rather well at the moment.<br><br>Please remember to <b>*back up*</b> your current bmk before you get started!!<br><br>You can download the early beta version from <a href="http://brucey.net/programming/blitz/misc/bmk/bmk_ng.zip" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a> (209k).<br>Copy the modules into their respective locations - into BRL and Pub folders.<br>Once built, copy the bmk exe and the two (core and make) .bmk files into the bin folder.<br><br>Please remember to <b>*back up*</b> your current bmk before you get started!!<br><br><br>And most of all, have fun ;-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
