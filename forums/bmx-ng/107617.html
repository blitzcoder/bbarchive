Local stringContainer:TContainer&lt;String&gt; = New TContainer&lt;String&gt;
</pre><br><br>In a code generation sense, I don't see any need to generate a "special" type for this instance.<br>In essence "T" is an Object, so the field _t is basically  _t:Object.<br><br>The magic lies in how the compiler (bcc) understands that the variable "stringContainer" will only accept a String into its set() method.<br><br><pre class=code>
stringContainer.set("Hello World")
</pre><br>is valid.<br><br><pre class=code>
Local myObj:TSomeType = New TSomeType

stringContainer.set(myObj)
</pre><br>should throw a compiler error, because myObj is not a String.<br><br>I can't see any immediate problems with that...<br><br><br>You should also be able to construct things like this:<br><pre class=code>
Interface IPair&lt;K, V&gt;
    Method GetKey:K()
    Method GetValue:V()
End Interface

Type TPair&lt;K, V&gt; Implements IPair&lt;K, V&gt;
  Field key:K
  Field value:V

  Method New(key:K, value:V)
    self.key = key
    self.value = value
  End Method

... etc
</pre><br>In this case again, the generated code will declare key and value fields as Object.<br><br>There is also something called a bounded type parameter, this is where "T" must be of a specific Type (or interface). So, for example :<br><pre class=code>
Type TWarrior&lt;T Extends TWeapon&gt;
  Field weapon:T

  Method New(weapon:T)
    self.weapon = weapon
  End Method

  Method attack()
      weapon.attack()
  End Method
... etc
</pre><br>In this case, T must be of type TWeapon when an instance of TWarrior is created...<br><pre class=code>
Local archer:TWarrior&lt;TBow&gt; = new TWarrior&lt;TBow&gt;(New TLongBow)
archer.attack()
</pre><br><br>The generated code for TWarrior would make the field weapon, a TWeapon, allowing to contain any subclasses of TWeapon.<br><br>Again, all the work is done by the compiler to ensure type safety.<br><br><br>Are there any obvious flaws here?

Having generics in BlitzMax would be awesome, but doing type erasure like this puts some severe limitations on the ways these generics can be used.<br><br>The biggest one is that it completely excludes all non-object types from being bound to type parameters. For example, the #1 reason why I find collections such as TList in BlitzMax annoying to use is because having a list of, say, Int, is simply not possible without either<br>A) wrapping every Int in another object, which comes with a performance hit, or<br>B) writing a separate version of the class such as "TIntList", which would basically just be the original class with the element type replaced by Int.<br><br>This is already annoying in Java (which does workaround A by having separate dedicated wrapper classes for every primitive type), but it would be even worse in BlitzMax, where non-object types don't only amount to primitives, but also to function references, pointers and structs, in other words an infinite number of types that have no inheritance relationships between each other. This wouldn't be a problem if TList&lt;T&gt; was a truly generic type, with no constraints as to what T can be.<br><br>In addition, type erasure as it is done in Java also creates a bunch of other limitations. For instance, creating a new object from a type parameter or casting to a generic type is not possible without knowing the exact type at runtime.

In BlitzMax, you can easily emulate that by using a Type and a TList. For example, put the list inside your type, add every newly created object to the list, and remove it again when you don't need it anymore. Maybe add a few more convenience methods to replace Before, After, etc. - and you've got what BlitzBasic had. That's pretty much exactly what the converter does, it just has some problems translating the BlitzBasic code correctly.<br>But if you want to do things the exact same way as in BlitzBasic, why not just use BlitzBasic? BlitzMax is a different language, so of course it has differences. There is absolutely no reason to try and put an awkward, limited feature from an outdated programming language into a much newer and better one, where it has been superseded by way more powerful tools. This might sound a bit rude, but if you consider something like that complicated or confusing, you might not have much use most of BlitzMax's other features anyway.<br>The code implies that you seem to have a slight misconception of how types work in BlitzBasic as well. You have a type named CHAIR, and then you're creating 100 of these chairs in a loop, but assigning each of them to a variable named...room? A room and a chair are very different things. A room might contain chairs, but what this variable of yours actually stores <b>is</b> one individual chair at a time. By doing <i>For room.chair = Each chair</i>, for example you're assigning every existing chair to the variable "room", one after another, and <i>room\x = room\x + 1</i> increases the variable "x" of that specific chair by 1.<br>Manually converting your example into BlitzMax code would be really simple:<br><pre class=code>' Define the CHAIR Type

Next</pre><br>What your naming implies is that you're actually imagining a room full of chairs? This "List" that I added would be that room, but you are not required to put it into the Type itself. Unlike in BlitzBasic, where every Type has a single invisible list automatically attached to it, in BlitzMax you can create and use such a list anywhere, so it might make more sense to write the code like this:<br><pre class=code>' Define the CHAIR Type

There aren't many operations that could be done on a completely unbounded type parameter, for example calling T.ToString() wouldn't be allowed. But that's fine for writing a generic collection. If the need for a restriction to class types arises, one could express it with a constraint like &lt;T Extends Object&gt;, which would then make calling the basic object methods possible.

Do you already know how you want to handle this?<br><br>(*** The idea was for it to accept an enhanced version of BlitzMax with a bunch of added language features that I always wished it had, and to compile it back into standard BlitzMax code. Local type inference and lambda expressions were among them, but several other things that I wanted to add, like overloading, are already supported by NG, yay!) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
