Or a Cray supercomputer with some nice weather simulation software on it.<br><br>Blitz is providing a nice interim solution here for all Blitz3D coders that have not yet migrated to BlitzMax because Max3D is not yet ready. So at least the Windows coders now no longer have a reason not to switch. To make the thing even sweeter, they added support for other languages which might attract new customers that do not want to code in a BASIC-language and only need a decent game engine. So there is a market for it and there will be customers.<br><br>I won't buy it because the SDK is Windows-only, and therefore completely uninteresting for me -- I care for the Mac, but not for Windows. I also do not need a 3D engine at this very moment. But that is just me and my personal needs. If I was a Blitz3D user, however, I'd put the bucks on the table and move on to BlitzMax plus the B3SDK. It's a great migration path and you can use it with a nice OO language. 100 bucks just is no money for a tool like that and the folks at Blitz also don't get free beer and Pizza and have rents to pay.<br><br>If you want free software, use free software and live with its shortcomings.<br><br>If you like XNA or think it is a great solution for what you do, go ahead and use it. It's just that nobody should expect any kind of support or understanding from loyal Blitz users for frustrated trolling against the new B3SDK or its ridiculously low price. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I don't know what kind of problems you're talking about, no problems here. If you're buying the membership for the gamecreators club $99 a year you'll get the runtime and libs for the Xbox360 (You also get TorqueX for free then) with which you can publish for the console (connected via ethernet) on a private not commecial usage. Beside of homebrew stuff this is especially great for small developers who want to make a step into the console world and build prototypes or complete games which they can offer to publishers. What you can't do is selling your stuff on Xbox 360 yet. This will be addressed in XNA Pro, were no details have been announced yet.<br><br>In my opinion this is the best offer there is around from all the console makers out there. You can access all the hardware! Sony doesn't offer this and Nintendo's WiiWare also won't offer this as it seems that you'll still need a devkit. If you have a devkit you still will need a gametool to make your game. For this you can choose unity2 for instance but this will cost you a) a unity pro licence and b) an extra licence to publish for the Wii on top of the devkit. I have no idea how you can develop games for the ps3 which can make use of the hardware. Anyone around?<br><br>Obviously best would be if they would give it out for free or for a fixed amount of money instead of a membership or only charge you for the pro version but on the other side you won't get a better deal for homebrew suff on a legal base for a console at the moment. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But anyone who has a creators club license is capable (and allowed) to share with other CC owners. But for windows development it's all fair game to distribute your game. X360 isn't the ONLY platform for XNA (and imo, not worth developing for unless you're going commercial).
