The managed code is bloated.  Takes up a lot of resources(1.0mb of memory in Cpp in typical usage in C# is around 20-50mb depending) due to the garbage clean up and the way it allocates memory.  I havent worked with with Blitz Max much, but C# does handle objects faster than Blitz3d thats for sure.  Where you can gain a huge performance in C# over native blitz is with multi threading... using the thread pool and performing tasks with the background worker.  Note that you cannot Multi-thread actually blitz functions such as rendering.. But you can manage your own code so that object manipulation and the data you send to blitz is better managed and threaded.  C++ is by far the powerhouse.  It can be a royal pain to code in though and atleast with my bad programming practices I get random application crashes and loose memory its just haha.  Unless you REALLY know what youre doing C++ for game dev is difficult.  Im still curious about C#'s over all speed and resource usage on a large scale game project though. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I think even BlitzMax is faster than C# in floats. The good thing about C++ is that it crashes whenever you make an error, that will teach people to program cleanly. The managed code handler in C# just teaches people to do crappy code, as it watches and correct too many things which should be corrected in the source code in first place. BlitzMax has also some advantages over C++, as it has the SuperStrict mode, which should be used always imho. Not sure if C++ has a similar thing (it has simple Strict at least). I also like the GCSuspend() command in BlitzMax, as you can test with it immediately if you have some memory leaks in your program by turning the GC off. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Syntax and compilation speed are completely unrelated. I don't deny that there are a long line of slow basic languages, but you can't get from there to saying that this is because of the syntax. <br><br>You're making a huge logical leap, which is leading you to your mistake. It's the same mistake you'd be making if you found that most football teams with relatively few supporters lose more games than they win, and concluded that having relatively few supporters causes teams to lose games. It could be that teams who lose a lot of games don't attract supporters. It could even be a complete coincidence.<br><br>In this case, the long line of slow basic languages is largely because BASIC was historically an interpreted language. Indeed there are some ignorant programmers who are still completely unaware than it can be a compiled language at all. It's also due in a big way to not being taken seriously, which meant that people capable of writing good compilers weren't writing them for a BASIC syntax. <br><br>Syntax is not inherently slow or fast. Compilers produce inherently slow or fast code. If you were right, there wouldn't be a huge chasm in speed between Blitzmax and Blitz3D execution speed, because their syntax is practically identical. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

And then those people would be well adviced to remain silent forever afterwards.<br><br>It's the code the compiler generates and the used (runtime) libraries that cause the performance difference, not the source language itself.<br><br>But if you need to compare, then BlitzMax can only be compared to a strongly typed language that runs on a runtime system with garbage collection. Basically something like C#.NET, Java or Objective-C 2.0. Pascal, C and C++ are out of the question, because they do not have garbage collection (unless you are comparing the "managed" .NET versions of those languages).<br><br>By the way, since when is Pascal slower than C? Pascal and C are languages on almost exactly the same level with an almost identical featureset. Pascal just did not have pointer arithmetics, that's all. It did not keep Apple from writing many parts of the original Mac &amp; Lisa operating systems and toolbox in Pascal.<br><br>And since when are Pascal compilers written in C? The Free Pascal compiler is written in Pascal, as the Mono Visual Basic compiler is written in Visual Basic and the Mono C# compiler is written in C#. The difference is that Free Pascal does not need any runtime systems that are written in a different language. As said above, Pascal is a language that can and has been used to write operating systems.<br><br>If somebody now wants to say something about the slowness of the good old UCSD Pascal... Then he or she should remember that UCSD Pascal used a virtual machine just like Java and C# do today. The difference being that the UCSD Pascal VM ran well enough on a 1 MHz 6502 CPU, when the first Java VM ran painfully slow even on a Pentium CPU when it was released.<br><br>But coming back to some of the benchmarks. I think that above two results measured by Lumooja speak for themselves:<br><br>Visual C++ 2005:<br>311<br>320<br>311<br>310<br>321<br><br>MinGW:<br>601<br>601<br>601<br>601<br>591<br><br>Those are both C++ compilers on the SAME machine, compiling the very SAME code in the very SAME programming language. And, interesting enough, BlitzMax even performs better than the GNU C++ compiler on that machine, even though BlitzMax itself was created in GNU C++:<br><br>BlitzMax:<br>586<br>581<br>591<br>582<br>586<br><br><br>But in the end, this entire discussion is just complete useless nonsense. <br><br>Productivity is much more important than used CPU cycles. Python is one of the most productive programming languages that are currently available, but it is also one of the slowest when it comes to runtime performance. However, that just does not matter in the end: It is still "fast enough" for any job. <br><br>Programmers are more expensive than computer hardware and CPU cycles., therefor what really matters is that it is much cheaper to get the code written and the job done with Python than it would be with a low level language like C++ or even Java or C#. Python code is also much more maintainable and much better readable than C/C++/Java/C#-code over time.<br><br>Enough said for tonight. ;-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
