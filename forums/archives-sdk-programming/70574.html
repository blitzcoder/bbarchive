Not all development houses use the same development packages and the language used is not always C++ (by all programmers on a given project), despite that usually being the only language you see pushed on forums.  The companies in "big" business aren't interested in spending years writing complete engines in C++ from scratch for their next project (although this does happen from time to time, often in someones spare time however) - they are in the business to make money and keeping their investors happy (or at least off of their backs).  This means getting the product out on the chosen platforms as quickly as possible.<br><br>I apologise for my terrible sentence structure, grammar, rambling, the gerbils and an extremely upset aardvark etc.  I'm very, very tired. :)<br><br>[Edit: Oh I should point out that I am not a professional programmer, I just used to know a few in the business.

Blitz3D hides so much of the stuff you'd need to know to be able to do anything at all in most 3d engines that a prospective employer simply could not tell if you knew it or not. At what point are you required to do matrix, quaternion or even vector math in a B3D app? Never, because it does it all for you. You *might* have used all three, but you might not. I've written half a dozen games in B3D, two pretty big ones, and I've never gone beyond mid-level vector math in any of them. When I took the next step up and started using TV3D, I had to ( actually, I didn't *have* to, but the game I wanted to make pretty much determined it ) start learning quaternion and matrix math. Even now I'm doing some of the actual math with helper functions, but I still need to know what operations I need to use, and I never did in Blitz. In Blitz you get cool stuff like AlignToVector and TFormPoint which do it all for you. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So if you're after a job that requires C++, you're after a low-level job, engine programmer or at least expected to work with the engine at a low level, in which case you may well be the guy who's required to *write* those helper functions, not use them. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
