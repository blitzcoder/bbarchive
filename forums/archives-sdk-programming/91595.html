It seems the real dev guy is (however why) now gone.<br><br>So now mark has begun make a real new language? possibly it has to do with the mobile/flash/andriod version of blitz[however].<br><br>This is not a decrade, mark, i respect your work and the team. If my telling was real, so you should realy make some of the codes opensource. I think the dev guy would have no problems with this... since you already have wrote the engine is old.<br><br>I know a guy wich has make the Acknex Engine, mark.<br>The Acknex 4 Engine came out as Unreal2 was published.<br>The Acknex 4 Engine worked only with directx 6.<br>The Acknex 4 Engine editors was more used as the unreal editors. Into the creative commercial range.<br>Today is Acknex 7 sold, market as "Game Studio" with the baddest game-template ever created for a 3d engine.<br>Today the Acknex 7 Engine supports Shaders, newer directx versions etc. but is not so good as the Leadwerks Engine.<br>For a long time the Acknex 5 and Acknex 6 Engine was Opensource. Only to guys wich has access to the code. These guys was selected from the community to code on the project. They had become contracts etc.<br>Therefore existed a Acknex SDK wich pulled good C/C++ dev-guys into the Game-Studio community.<br><br>Ok Blitz3D is very good into the core but as SDK not realy a hype. You should make Blitz3D loading a DLL File wich uses the functions of the compiled Blitz3D executable. So you can get some good C/C++ dev-guys into the community.<br><br>Actualy all C/C++ dev-guys knows how to do make some iPhone, Android &amp; Flash code. What you do if these guys are gone? You are than going back into making Blitz3D compatible with DirectX 13? Or you are making supports for new languages into the new-coming-blitz-cross-code-compiler/converter as fulltime job?<br><br>Do not more longer wait and make more out of Blitz3D. Puki has already posted very good blitz3d samples. One Id-guy says directx 9 is not dead etc.<br>I do wrote the idea of blitz3d is good. What must happen to regonize you?<br><br>Erm... ontopic... Opensource is not a realy choice for mark, i think. You should happier if a new blitz3d is coming out on some day. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
