I found only one issue (I am not sure if this is a bug) that I managed to override.<br>I think that Mark's choice to provide in the near future a new SDK is in the right direction (I am not sure if there is another direction anyway).<br>The most difficult task in my opinion is to keep the stability of the old one.<br>What I mean: In the past 2 weeks I downloaded the trial version of DB Pro (Dark Basic Pro) in order to implement a DLL and make users able to load my UDrop Pro files from within the DB Pro environment. After too many tries I didn't manage to make my DLL work because the the DB Pro .exe was being crashed under unknown conditions. I decided to quit and most important not to buy the DB Pro (yap, I was thinking about that) because I was afraid that the whole product is unstable too and I couldn't complete a serious project. The same process with Blitz Basic was a matter of tow days to complete.<br>Every fancy ability of DX9.0 (or above) is not so much important than my nerves when I am trying to explain an unexplained bug...<br>@Barton: If you can spend some money I advise you to buy the current Blitz3D SDK because first you will gain experience working with an SDK and second I believe that the new SDK of Mark will delay much more (I hope to prove wrong :) ). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But then Threading is quite a large subject that you will never completely learn from an instruction video. Sure a video can show you some small examples, but thats pretty much equivalent to the code-snippets already available in the BlitzMax forums.<br><br>I've used threads since about 2000 (Delhi and Java) at work and I want to say it's very much a "Easy to grasp, hard to master" subject (like much other stuff in programming). I had to write ~3-4 real apps/modules and face different problems involved with threads and be forced to solve them in a satisfactory way before I myself felt that I really understood them. I still am no master though :)<br><br>Programming is a lot like mathematics in this way: The more you do it the better you get. And the better you get the more humble you become because your horizon widens and you start to understand how little you know and how much more there is to learn. There will never be a day in my life I'll feel that "I now know everything there is to know about programming".<br><br>So back on the documentation subject: I don't think the pricetag on Blitz*-products entitles us to get more docs than we got. If someone would write a book I'd buy it. But using the forums/code-archives is the primary way to learn BlitzMax right now, and that works pretty well imho.<br><br>And as GaryV said:<br><br><div class="quote"> <br>There are numerous sites explaining how to use threading. The principle is the same for most languages.<br> <br></div><br><br>Also for other languages there are large books on the single subject threading. Example: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Java-Threads-Scott-Oaks/dp/0596007825" target="_blank">http://www.amazon.com/Java-Threads-Scott-Oaks/dp/0596007825</a><br><br>If you want to learn threading well you could pick up this book or find a good website and install java6 + eclipse (both are free/OpenSource software) and try out some examples. Most of the things you'd learn (as GaryV said) is directly applicable on BlitzMax. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
