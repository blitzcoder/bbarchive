Languages like Emergence Basic, Aurora, Power Basic, Delphi and other languages are now capable of accessing everything B3D SDK has to offer and this is basically good for BRL, as well as for the owners of the languages involved.<br><br>However, there is a small problem regarding the distribution of declaration files. For example: I have created Emergence Basic (EBasic) blitz3dsdk.inc file, which I would like to make available to the Ebasic community. Nothing wrong with that as long as they purchase the SDK in order to use it. But what happens if they (again legitimately) purchase or download a free application that uses the redistributable SDK DLL? Armed with the DLL and the include file any competent (insert the name of your language here) programmer would be able to take advantage of B3D SDK without purchasing it from BRL!<br><br>That is why I would like to hear from BRL first. I did send first version of my EBasic translation to them (skidracer) a few weeks ago but never got any reply. I would like for any additional translation of declaration files to be available to B3D SDK puchasers only but frankly speaking, if BRL does not answer in a week or two I would assume they don't care and would release the EBasic and Aurora includes to the respective communities. Of course, I would not distribute the DLL and would try to use Molebox or something similar to hide it from prying eyes but you know how it goes. Sooner or later the SDK DLL will be out (it already is) in the open.<br><br>Mark, Skid? What's your opinion and what would you like us to do?<br><br>Barney <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'll leave the main question for Mark/skids to reply to, but b3d.dll is a copyright-protected file for which you need a license to re-distribute, so anyone looking to release anything developed in this way will still have to buy a copy.<br><br>Releasing b3d.dll with software while not owning a copy of the SDK -- which provides the license to re-distribute the DLL -- is copyright infringement, regardless of whether the software is freeware/commercial or anything else. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
