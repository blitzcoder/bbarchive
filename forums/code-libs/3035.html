For those who haven't used it before, exception handling lets you define control points with "handlers", and if you encounter an error deep inside many nested function calls, jump straight up the stack to the control point without having to mess about with returning error codes and have each function report that it failed to its individual call site and so on and so forth. Very good for the lazy coder.<br><br>In BlitzMax, you'd define the control point and handler with a Try/Catch block. We don't have those in Blitz3D, and have no way to define new syntax, so instead what we do is define the body and handler as two separate functions, and pass their function pointers to WithExceptionHandler (this is why you need the FastPointer DLL: this can't be done without function pointers), along with an argument for the body code.<br><br>Here's a demonstration:<br><br><textarea class=codebox name="code" wrap=OFF readonly="true" rows="15" cols="80">
Function Foo(a)
	Print "Opening Foo with argument " + a
	Bar(42)
	Print "Ending Foo (never reached!)"
End Function

Function Bar(a)
	Print "In Bar with " + a
	
	;Oh no! An 'exceptional situation' requires special abort procedure!
	ThrowException(42)
	
	Print "We never get here!"

</textarea><br><br><br>In the event you hit an "exceptional situation", calling ThrowException will jump right out of whatever you were doing, all the way back to the level of WithExceptionHandler, and call the handler function with whatever you passed as the exception code, which can then take any necessary steps to rectify the situation using this code (use this to signal a particular flag or perhaps pass a data object). WithExceptionHandler will then return the result of the handler function instead of whatever would have been returned had no exception been thrown.<br><br>So in the above example:<br>-- WithExceptionHandler is called with Foo, Hdl and 47<br>-- WithExceptionHandler calls Foo with 47<br>-- Foo does some stuff and calls Bar with 42<br>-- Bar panics, as its mathematics breaks down around the non-value that is 42<br>-- Bar calls ThrowException with 42<br><b>-- ThrowException nukes the call stack all the way down to WithExceptionHandler again</b><br>-- WithExceptionHandler is informed that something went wrong, and calls Hdl to deal with it<br>-- Hdl deals with the problem, and returns a final value<br><br><br>It's not that difficult once you get used to it: it's basically just a way to immediately return past more than one function call at a time. Note that this doesn't catch or otherwise interact with system or hardware exceptions (division by zero, MAV, etc.) - it only works with your own "soft" errors.<br><br><br><b>Be warned</b> however, that bypassing everything that happens in the rest of the function will <i>also</i> bypass B3D's own internal cleanup instructions! These are important for dealing with object reference counts, string memory, and other things that it manages to keep things safe. If you jump out of the middle of a function (or there's one in the middle of the nuked section of stack) that would have needed to cleanup strings or type objects, you will likely get memory leaks as the hidden cleanup code is also bypassed! Not to mention that of course any Free calls of your own will be skipped over too.<br><br>So, I suggest for safety:<br><br>-- preferably only use this code with functions that deal in integers and floats (you should be safe with entities, images, banks and other "int handle"-style objects)<br><br>-- if you have to use type objects, <i>only</i> pass them in parameter slots or via global variables. DO NOT use anything that would "return" an object (this includes the Object command itself) if there's a risk that the cleanup code will be skipped over. Simple parameters appear to be OK as B3D optimises out their refcounts anyway. If in doubt, do not use.<br><br>-- Do not use unboxed strings anywhere near this code. Literals should be OK, but I expect using string variables is asking for disaster. Pass them in globals or type objects if necessary.<br><br>-- finally, <b>this code is not safe</b>. If in doubt, do not use it at all! This is for advanced users who want to "play about" only! "Using setjmp for exception handling" is one of those things that almost everyone on the internet will tell you never to do, and with good reason.<br><br><br>Stern warnings aside... enjoy!

So the only control point <i>it</i> can see is the one wrapping the entire program structure.<br><br>Languages designed with exceptions from the start can be designed to make the compiler "aware" of OS exceptions (C++ can be designed to do this; BlitzMax does not as far as I can tell). But because this is a low-level system feature involving processor interrupts and the like, there's no easy way to write code that can integrate with it without the compiler having been designed to do it from the start.<br><br>This code provides a <i>second</i> exception system internal to your program logic. It is not tied to the hardware, and that means it can only catch exceptions that you threw <i>by hand</i> using ThrowException. The OS doesn't know about it and can't hook it's own existing exception system into it.<br><br>You could use it to deal with things like that, but only by writing wrapper code that detects the exceptional situation using the same kind of guards that you'd use to detect them in exceptionless B3D code:<br><br><pre class=code>

</textarea><br><br>i.e. Strings are a 24-byte (so six word) structure. The second word is a pointer to the actual string data buffer. The third and fourth words are the length of the string, and the length of the data buffer (allocated in blocks and therefore usually slightly longer than the string itself) respectively. The fifth and sixth words are pointers to the preceding and following strings in B3D's internal string management system. I was not able to work out what, if anything, the first data word represents, and I can't think of a use for it either (it doesn't appear to be a reference count).<br><br>Further thoughts:<br><br>-- the string headers are allocated from a free list to keep 'em small and fast<br>-- string buffer data looks to be handled similarly<br>-- every time a string is assigned to a variable, passed as a function parameter, or returned from a function, a new header is allocated which makes passing strings rather slow (stick them in an array or object for faster passing)<br>-- I was not able to work out/cannot remember how string buffers are shared, when B3D decides to copy them, or when it decides to free them. There is no obvious sign that it uses refcounting, but it might be using tracing instead which we can't easily tell from looking at memory dumps<br><br>Perhaps this helps (incidentally, if you want to investigate this further I suggest opening a forum thread, as we're no longer talking at all about the archive entry).<br><br><br><b>EDIT:</b> if you meant string parameters to DLL functions - those are copied into a temporary buffer before the DLL is called; B3D's internal string data never gets passed to the DLL.
