This is a command set I've designed which will take strings and scroll them in your game, very similar to the Legend of Zelda games. This command set includes many custom functions, as well as embedded string commands to spice up the text (e.g., changing color, pausing, skipping, ect.). Note that for speed reasons, you will need the FastImage library to run this demo. If you don't have it currently, you can check out the FastImage demo, which will show the full effect of my code, but you will eventually need to buy the FastImage library to use my command set in any game (it's a very reasonable price for what it can do).<br><br>You will also need to download the media required to run it (images, soundfx). The link is below, which will have everything minus the FastImage library files, but you can just copy those files to the root folder to use. When you download the file, run "Zelda-Text Demo.bb", and it will start the whole process.<br><br>Here's the link to the download. To download, click on the link, then go to File--&gt;Download and save it to your computer. From there, just unzip and make sure the program has access to the FastImage .dll files.<br><a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BzVV3pB-PsxWbldIVU11MkNueHc/edit?pli=1" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BzVV3pB-PsxWbldIVU11MkNueHc/edit?pli=1</a><br><br>And, here's the code below. Keep in mind that I'm posting the code here so you can mentally preview what it does, but you will still need the media to run this code. If this is too much to take in, try the download link instead. The demo file uses Includes to break it all up and make it easier to understand.<br><br>If you have questions, read the help file I made (Zelda-Text Header Help.bb"). That will explain the whole command set in detail.<br><br>And, I ask that you please be kind with any criticism. Keep in mind that I'm a self-taught hobbyist programmer, so my techniques might not be the best approach regarding speed, efficiency, ect. However, I am certainly open to suggestions if anyone has advice to give.<br><br>EDIT: I've shortened the code to only show the demo file. This only shows the raw essentials to the demo (no functions, types, ect.). The rest is all in the include files, so try the download link and you're all set!<br><textarea class=codebox name="code" wrap=OFF readonly="true" rows="15" cols="80">

;Now we create a map

;We now must load a tile image! 
;This function is a SMART function for square tiles. 
;That means you can have an image up to 16x16 tiles (256 Tile MAX) 
;It reads the tiles from Top to Bottom and Left to Right! 
;All we need to provide is the image handel and the square size of one tile (32 here)

</textarea><br>This is important, so pay attention: In order for you to use my system, you will need to:<br>A) Create a new folder in your game's root called "Text Scrolling".<br>B) Inside that folder, drop all of the text scrolling related files. You can get them from the link above. This should total 3 folders called "Fonts", "Images", and "SoundFX", as well as 3 .bb files, the Zelda text functions and the Zelda text setup. I've chosen to put FastImage.bb inside this folder, but if you want to change it, be sure the Include command in your main file reflects the new location.<br>c) Eventually, you should consider adding a new file in this folder called "Zelda Text Scripts.bb" and keep all of your text-to-be-scrolled inside this file. Then just include this file in the Main (there's one already commented out in there for you), and your IDE will look a lot cleaner.<br><br>If you can get it to work, your next step is to read through the help file I've included.

My guess is that the include files have been tampered with too much and it's changing the way the scroller works. If the window is glitching, try downloading the file from above again and replacing it with the version you have. This will ensure that the code in the include files is how it was released. If it's just not letting you exit, remember that I defaulted the "Action Button" to the left Alt key on the keyboard. Also, the game window needs to be active to accept any input from the keyboard. As far as changing colors at the end, you do realize that I intentionally changed the color to green at the end of the first section, right? Also, remember that when you change the sections of a text (going from 1 to 2), the color is reset back to white. To override this, just add in another {Color} command at the beginning of the section. Finally, if it is not playing a sound and the include files are untouched from when you downloaded them, then make sure the sound files are in the correct folder to load. If they don't load, I believe that Blitz ignores the missing files and just doesn't play the sounds. I can't remember off of the top of my head where the sounds should be located at, but you can open up the Zelda-Text Setup.bb file and see where the sounds should be located relative to your game's root.<br><br>Aside from that, there should be no reason at all that the text is messing up.
