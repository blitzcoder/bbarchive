This thread may be removed in a few days)<br><br>Not sure if this is a bug in Blitz or somewhere else in this machine. Blitz worked without problems until yesterday. I was compiling a program that was trying to use a function from a 3d headset dll, something we discussed some time ago in the Blitz3D section.<br><br>During compiling the progressbar then used to freeze. I had to kill the blitz tasks in the task manager. After that Blitz (or the IDE) couldn't be started anymore. When I run it, there's some activity, the hourglass, but then nothing happens. 3 Tasks show up in the manager: ide, blitz3d and blitzcc. But no visible IDE. Got to kill them manually.<br><br>Reinstalling the Update (191 or 196) didn't help. So I completely uninstalled Blitz3D (the file cfg blitz.fon was locked for some reason and couldn't be uninstalled, I clicked "ignore").<br><br>Then I reinstalled Blitz3D from the original CD (I think version ~1.64). This version was working. THen I updated to 196 - no success, the same problem again. So I De-Reinstalled again and updated to 191, again without success.<br><br>It's an old Thinkpad that I use to surf the web, with win98 (not SE) and msie 5.5.<br><br>191 was running without any problems before, what could be the cause?<br><br>I didn't install anything in that time, so I think it's nothing to do with a new app. I also scanned the system for viruses using the latest antivir update. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I already tried a new install after a reboot. The font file is no more locked after the reboot .<br><br>The CD version is 1.66. This version is working. After ending it, the font file is still unlocked. I just tried to install 1.87, without success. Installation ends ok, but when I run Blitz, again no IDE (at least not visible, tho it's listed in the task manager - seems to hang). After this hanging the font file is locked. I guess it has something to do with msie that is the frame for the IDE. I already tried its repair function without success. now I'll try to "uninstall" msie, aka downgrade to version 4. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's hard to isolate the problem since there is no error message. Sometihing must be damaged permanently. It's not part of msie or blitz, it must be something else, maybe a registry thing.<br><br>Or maybe it's one of those things that are protecting themselves from uninstallation by using the systems restore features - tho I doubt this works on win98 unless it's a homebrew restore thing.<br><br>This is only my 2nd machine, I'm coding on the other one. But it's useful to have this web terminal blitz-enabled, so I can test the code snippets I am posting frequently, etc. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Mainly because I got to install all those tools and restore a lot of stuff like bookmarks etc. I hate it. But of course, that will be the "final solution". Probably I'm going to install linux then anyway, but it's a bit unplaned by now.<br><br>I tried to install one of the free IDE's and :) I miserably failed again. BIDE crashed, and IndED (had to register a forum account to download it) tells me I should select the blitz compiler, but I already did that, so I have no idea what's wrong, plus a couple of frequent error messages - uninstall ASAP! I didn't try those IDEs using .NET because I'm pretty sure .NET will be the final killing hit for this stoneage machine.<br><br>Wow, now I've spent a lot of hours and still no luck.

It was a decls file. I made some "experimental" (don't ask) tests. So in my decls file there was a funcion name beginning with an underscore:<br><br><pre class=code>
_AutoDetectComPort%():"AutoDetectComPort"
</pre><br><br>This caused the Ide to hang. Using this instead:<br><br><pre class=code>
AutoDetectComPort%():"AutoDetectComPort"
