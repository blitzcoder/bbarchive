Delete a; ok stil one left

a.alien = Last alien

a.Alien = New Alien
If a &lt;&gt; Null Then Print "Alien exists!"
Delete a ; Ok stil one left cause there is one to many made

; stil the program say no ther is no more
If a = Null Then Print "Alien gone!"

;ok test it go to the last one
a.alien = Last alien

;thats stange its back again while the program say its gone??????

In the case of 'a.Alien = New Alien' you're creating an object of Type 'Alien' and storing its object pointer in the pointer variable 'a.Alien'.<br><br>The problem with your code is that you're storing all your object pointers in the same pointer variable, so each pointer value you store in that variable is overwriting the one stored before it and you're then checking that value to see if all the objects have been deleted. Since you did delete the last object you stored a pointer to in that variable then naturally checking that variable will tell you that it has been deleted (as object pointers use indirection). <br><br>So basically you've created three objects in your code and then deleted two of them. The pointer value stored in a.Alien has been overwritten a couple of times and is unreliable at the point where you check it in the code 'If a = Null Then Print "Alien gone!"'. The only reason you're getting a value returned that has any meaning at all there is because Blitz3D uses indirection (the object pointer points to an indirection pointer which points to the actual object) and the indirection pointer was nullified when you deleted the object it pointed to. Under different circumstances, checking that object pointer may have returned invalid data that could have caused problems if you'd tried to make use of it.<br><br>In the line 'a.alien = Last alien' you set the pointer variable 'a.alien' to hold a pointer to the last remaining 'Alien' object, which is actually the first object of Type 'Alien' that you created and never deleted. Since this was the object that you actually modified a field of, checking its value of that field for that object returns the value you set.<br><br>Try to avoid writing code where you need to check if an object has been deleted. Instead, use the linked list that all objects of a specific type get added onto to sequence through your remaining objects of that Type and carry out any functions you need to carry out for them. Or alternatively, store your object pointers on an array and nullify the array slot for any object that you delete. That way you know that you're dealing with reliable data that isn't getting overwritten. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I understand now the whole consept of null pointer. B3D is kind a messy if its come to type with the same label namems.<br><br>I am busy programming a turn based game, and had some problems using delete on a type. thats why this question. During the game ships is goming and going pretty fast in the game. That means 1 turn i have 10 ships and the next turn i lose 4 ships. ect...<br>Because op the position of every ship and the differend types of ships i can nod delete any kind of type. Every type who is connected to a specific ship must deleted if needed. <br>That mean that i delete a type and was expecting that the whole pointer was shifting so the list of labeled types are complete. I was thinking that the next  type was writable. I got an error when i did try it. later on i discoverd it and now im checking the contance if the type of ship is the right one.<br><br> thanks guys. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Blitz3D, not permitting types or functions to be used as values, puts them in separate namespaces. Therefore it's perfectly possible and legitimate (if unreadable) to have a type, function and global all with the same identifier, as they will never collide (e.g. "Global myType.myType = myType()").<br><br>Blitz3D names also can't begin with an underscore (I'm guessing that's reserved to make life easier for the linker?). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
