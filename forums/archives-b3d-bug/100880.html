Using only focus-checking like the above is half the solution: it stops considering key input when the program is out of focus.<br><br>However, like you said, when you return to the program the key is still considered as "pressed". This is the other half of the problem left to solve.<br>To address this issue, you need to code that whenever you <b>return</b> focus to your program, you emit false "KEY UP" events to all the keys you are listening for in your program. A "KEY UP" event means, "this key was released. It's not being pressed anymore."<br>If your program listens for space, left-control, enter, shift etc., you need to emit these false events for all these keys once you return focus to your program - and you just have to do this once, to eliminate that perpetuous "pressed" state (you don't necessarily have to emit events for all keys, just the ones that were pressed when the focus was lost - but it's better to be safe and do it for all).<br><br>To do this, you need yet another function from User32: keybd_event. It's actually an old function (SendInput is the modern, preferable version, but it's much more complicated than what I have time for), but seems to work so far.<br><br>1) You need this decls in the end:<br><pre class=code>.lib "user32.dll"

api_GetFocus% () : "GetFocus"
api_keybd_event (bVk%, bScan%, dwFlags%, dwExtraInfo%) : "keybd_event"</pre>2) Then you need to list all the virtual-key-codes as well as the hardware break-scan-codes for the keys you are using in your program. Each key has a specific pair of these values.<br>You can find them here: <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/7305/Keyboard-Events-Simulation-using-keybd_event-funct" target="_blank">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/7305/Keyboard-Events-Simulation-using-keybd_event-funct</a><br><br>3) Then proceed to use these two API functions in the following way:<br><pre class=code>Graphics( 320, 240, 0, 2 )
