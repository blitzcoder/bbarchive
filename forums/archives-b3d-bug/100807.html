Yes it uses OpenGL which can do 3D but it is rather technical, limited 3D support and not really beginner friendly!<br>MiniB3D is, as stated by the creator, not 100% Blitz3D compatible and requires changes to get older Blitz3D programs to work. Not MiniB3D's fault, a problem with how BlitzMax does things. Sure it's a good attempt to get Blitz3D functionality in to BlitzMax, best I have seen, but it's a 3rd party add-on which could run into compatibility problems on possible future BlitzMax updates.<br>As for Monkey, I don't have any desire to make my intended project run on iOS, Xbox 360, etc. It's not suitable for mobile deployment!<br><br><div class="quote"> xlsior: That has come up literally dozens of times over the past half a decade on this forum. Notice the distinct lack of such an update.  <br></div><br><br>I too have seen this topic many times and I have noticed the lack of an update. The many times it has come up and how hotly those topics are discussed just shows there is a high demand for such an update.<br><br>The excuse for not updating B3D to DirectX 9/10/11 is that Blitz3D is essentially DirectX 7, I.E. the 3D commands directly match the DirectX 7 API equivalents. Why does that stop an update? It does not, the code can be modified to make those commands work in the newer versions of DirectX without too many problems. Then there would be the opportunity to add a set of more advanced commands to do more in the newer DirectX versions. There really is no excuse for not updating Blitz3D other than that they wanted to concentrate on the production of BlitzMax which is multi-platform (and it's good for that reason) so OpenGL was chosen over DirectX and only as an included plug-in module with limited support for 3D. And now they have released Monkey (come on, give it a serious name at least if you want developers to take it more seriously!!) for jumping on the mobile and console bandwagon!<br><br>These are not views from an inexperienced user, I used to be a full time programmer using the C/C++ language. Life changes forced me to take a long break from C/C++ so I fell behind on my current knowledge for writing in C/C++ and C## for the Windows platform. I have Dark Basic Pro and I find the complexity of Dark Basic hard to get used to. It is also inconsistent with the plug-in modules. For example, I had an Nvidia GTX 420 graphics card (now have a GTX 660Ti) which has PhysX. The demos for the PhysX Module for Dark Basic worked fine until I compiled them myself, without any code changes, where they then complained that I do not have PhysX in my system! So I am weary of plug-in modules even for BlitzMax and I would rather have native DirectX 9/10/11 support in an updated Blitz3D than rely on a plug-in module for BlitzMax.<br><br>Blitz are missing out on a profit making opportunity by not upgrading Blitz3D, there is a high enough demand for it to justify the time making it, it is technically possible, just requires the time. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
