The coordinates to draw a pixel are given in the context of this shifted origin. WritePixel takes account of it; WritePixelFast does not.<br><br>This is probably intended behaviour rather than a bug - WritePixel is a drawing command intended to be used alongside other drawing commands, and lets you place a pixel in ARGB format for convenience. WritePixelFast on the other hand is supposed to be <i>fast</i>, so it would naturally ignore such things as origins and viewports and literally only set the specified buffer coordinates to the requested value - anything else is a waste of valuable CPU time in a command that's normally expected to be used in bulk.<br><br>What is a bug is that the documentation (or even the command name) doesn't draw this important distinction.<br><br><b>EDIT:</b> Yeah, SLotman's explanation for the actual crash is correct - sorry, I'd assumed this was obvious and gone straight to addressing the position of the write operations.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Basically the code is just a slighty modified version of the sin etc example in the docs as i was just experimenting with what speed difference there was between the original plot version &amp; writepixel/writepixelfast. <br><br>As i was not aware that the origin command does not affect writepixelfast command the output/error i was getting is pretty obvious now. Like you said Yasha the bug is indeed in the docs as origin states "This command sets a point of origin for all subsequent drawing commands. This can be positive or negative.", also there is no mention in the writepixelfast docs that it is not affected by the origin command.<br><br>basically to fix it now i know what was wrong is change the draw to <pre class=code>

I presume that the extra code to plot the point in the correct position is the culprit. BTW i am talking only a few millisecs, i ran both with 50 iterations &amp; the writepixelfast versions came in 100ms slower in total (not per iteration).<br><br>As a test to see raw throughput between writepixel &amp; writepixelfast i just done a FOR..NEXT loop to fill an 800x600 screen which had interesting results. On win7 writepixel took 16ms while writepixelfast took 13ms while winxp took 19ms &amp; 10ms respectively. Both where an average again over 50 iterations <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If it is an optimization then it is misguided. The simple arithmetic of adding an offset is so much faster than pixel drawing that any time saved is trivial.<br><br>And in practice it would probably be slower rather than faster. Origin is a convenience command, automatically adding an offset that would otherwise have to be done manually. If you are going to add an offset anyway why not let the compiler write the code. That should be faster that doing it yourself in the Blitz3D source. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
