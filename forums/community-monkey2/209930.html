Are you looking for public approval on the aspects of the language before moving on, are are they set in stone upon release?<br><br>Also do you consider that the language will massively fluctuate over development and are any new features added over time, more or less there to stay? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'm OK with the current approach but it does have a practical downside: 3rd party IDEs aren't generally able to auto capitalize keywords, which wont stop stuff compiling but it could mean 2 'styles' of monkey source evolve. So I haven't decided 100% one way or the other here. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'm assuming that's for variables?  Having always worked in VB, case sensitivity was one of those things that I thought would drive me nuts, but Monkey actually helped my discipline in capitalization a lot.  There are some advantages to having case sensitivity, mainly scope and shadowing type things,  and the aforementioned "gentle nudge" it gives towards having a consistent caps style.  I noticed that even VS2013 <i>still</i> has trouble fixing the autocaps stuff with VB on some variables in some circumstances, so code can start to look messy if you're not careful and aware of it.<br><br>Glad to hear that most of the underlying syntax from Monkey1 won't change. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

What does that mean?. :)<br><br>There is one good reason I can think of for using both Monkey 1 and Monkey 2 to develop a project and that would be Mojo. Mojo1 supports older style / limited performance GPU's much better then mojo2 as far as performance on fill rates of say sprites (way evident on mobile devices). So it would be nice to have the Monkey 2 coding syntax and style compatible with Monkey 1 at some level. This would allow me to develop for lower end GPU's on Monkey 1 / Mojo1 and still support higher end GPU's with Monkey 2 / mojo2. <br><br>I suppose that I could possibly import a gaming framework that would fit the project needs as described above, but all of them (current mainstream frameworks) would have the same retro GPU limitations as mojo2. I can definitely see an advantage for using both MX1 / Mojo1 and MX2 / Mojo2 together for development. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
