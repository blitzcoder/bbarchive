The problem with php.net's approach as I remember it is that examples end up being woefully out of date as the language breaks them or has other unwanted behavior, and top comments can often have old/outdated examples as well.  A "graduated" format resembling MSDN but with the social features of a wiki or other site for individual pages could work well -- having users be able to "graduate" from the comments section to the main article/wiki section rather easily, but displaying the main article first.  I wonder if there's a Wiki fork that shows the main page and the talk page simultaneously in a split view... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Eg forum badges, front page banner/feature space. You could even add gamification to user accounts so you gain experience for activities. People heart your posts, gain XP.
