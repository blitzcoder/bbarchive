But, I also believe that about curly braces.  Type sigils are one thing that I distinctly remember back when I was first learning code in QBASIC as a child, and also one of the last things for me to understand was "type correctness".  I personally think for comprehension, they're no good.  But they're great for shortcuts, as long as I don't have to read them.  That's why I'm happy they exist in Jungle, and use them there when I have to type a function/method with a lot of arguments.<br><br>As for variable scoping...... I do like "Dim/var/let" better, but I am happy with using it the current way now because, again, it feels like it makes the code much easier to read.  Scope resolution of variables (I'm presuming) are easier for IDEs to figure out on the fly, and this makes variable highlighting pretty darn sweet.<br><br>Anyway, with Paul on this one.  Verbosity in the right places for me, most other languages get this wrong.  I find many people's MonkeyX code difficult to read, and few here seem to comment their bigger blocks of code much, on top of all the other shortcuts they tend to take (whyyy?) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If IDE's are already converting #,%,$ to :Float, :Int, :String (which was news to me) this indicates to me that people at least prefer to 'read' words, not shortcuts, in code, so I think this is what the language should support. <br><br>I just don't like the language supporting both '%, '#' etc and ':Int', ':Float' - it can make it look too much like 2 quite different languages.<br><br>And if expansion to ':Int', ':Float' etc is a popular feature (and I assume it is) I'll make sure to add it to Ted2. <br><br>&gt; What mark needs to make is a simple poll/vote page with those idea's.<br><br>To be honest, I don't think there's a large enough number of active users to make this worthwhile just yet - I think results would be well within any margin of error!
