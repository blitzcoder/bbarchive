People looking for a "simple" 3d engine would probably benefit from taking a look at Unity or UE4 blueprints.  Shaders would be a nice "bonus" that may come with bringing the existing capabilities up to date with the last half-decade or so of progress since monkey was first conceived as gxtk or whatever, but 3d as it would exist in terms of feature parity to other engines is a pipe dream that many people severely underestimate the kind of undertaking it represents.  It would be a huge distraction that would take away from the core language design if it was considered this early on.  <br><br>If you need proof of this, try doing 3d in Monkey yourself using raw OpenGL calls.  I'm pretty sure it can be done without externs, but you'll soon find out the amount of effort it would take to get anywhere at all with this!  All of that can come later, when the language's practical utility can be demonstrated to a wider enthusiast community.  I wouldn't mind seeing something like this come out with monkey2, but I'm not about to push for it, because it's a high-risk-low-reward scenario for one programmer, especially one who hasn't been designing 3d engines predominately for 20+ years like Sweeney or Carmack. (not to presume, but!)<br><br>If it's a choice between burdening the end-developer with too much cruft and the language designer, I say leave the burden to the individuals.  A canonical 3d engine is <i>not</i> more important than the language itself, not even close. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

How can providing a "more" beautiful language alone be successful? People won't donate money on patreon for a nice looking language unless it serves a purpose for them. <br></div><br><br>I hate to break it to you, but people don't donate in general.  It is not typically a sustainable way to make a living unless you have rich friends, or are able to whip up a frenzy of people using agitprop, or a combination of both.  I'm sure Mark knows this, seeing as he ended up getting a day job after open sourcing large parts of Monkey.  I don't disagree with you that Monkey is a very nice language, however.<br><br>What I'm saying is that the way he is proceeding seems like the legitimate open source path to me, the way many other languages entered widestream adoption:  They start off as enthusiastic pet projects of a developer who has an existing day job, but because they are not constrained by the demands of a rabid fanbase, they're able to design something more or less in tune with their vision, rather than by the market forces of the niche their language happens to fall into.  They are not compromised by the flavor of the day;  they work with their own priorities, and so (if they survive past the hobby stage) many of them become respected general-purpose languages.  <i>This</i> is the most likely demographic that will bring Monkey out of obscurity.  Not the old blitzers, unfortunately, as loyal and well-intentioned as they were, but the new people who see a great language and want to contribute to that vision.<br><br>New life and breath is critical to garnering better community support for Monkey;  I commend the efforts of the wider Blitz community for the progress they've made in extending past BRL languages to support various things they wanted, but the truth of the matter is that their efforts have been unsatisfactory.  If they were capable, they probably wouldn't be complaining to Mark to code their pet features for them.  Mark is just one person, however, and it doesn't seem there's agreement that a 3d engine would be a good focus, so likely that sort of thing will have to be handled by the community -- and for that to happen in a satisfactory manner, the community needs new life!  I personally find it very unlikely that Mark could make something satisfactory to the old blitzers without making sacrifices to the quality of monkey2 at large.<br><br><div class="quote"> True Mark needs to focus on getting a strong language syntax down pat and build the core modules.

It gives the user the potential to do more out of the box. <br></div><br>You and I both know that basic 3d already exists for Monkey.  It is not a selling point because it is relatively difficult to pull off out of the box and relies on a lot of finite state machine stuff instead of shaders and other modern amenities.  Making that not-as-difficult to use won't magically bring in the type of users that will help the language expand and flourish.  It would only be done to appease old users who want a certain level of functionality.  Everyone NEW who wants 3d almost certainly wants the modern amenities which go with it.  Making that "simple"/approachable for newbies is a huge undertaking, one that would likely take a long time and be a large investment.  That's why everyone with sense has been saying that if it does happen (as a first party module), it will likely happen later, because it is nowhere near as a big a priority as the language itself, even though it's as large an undertaking in its own right.<br><br><div class="quote"> It sounds like restriction to C++ code generation will make a lot more things possible and will avoid some inherent weaknesses in Monkey1 features.<br>So time will tell and I wish Mark all the success he deserves and I will definitely be with virtual wallet in hand for patreon, I hope he makes it work. <br></div><br><br>Agreed.  Monkey does need some sorta "gimmick" to draw in people, make them say something other than "what, another new language?".  3d <i>could</i> be it, but I personally think it's a bit early to even consider.  Trans-compilation stuff was Monkey's initial killer feature, and this doesn't appear to change for Monkey2.  Mojo was icing on the cake.  Monkey does trans-compilation better than Haxe IMHO, but Haxe gets the attention because it has a better-backed userbase which migrated from ActionScript, whereas BMax/Blitz was already niche, and many people don't take BASIC seriously anymore.  There are a multitude of ways to break this impression, but none of them seem "easy" or apparently more obvious than the other.  Mark has chosen the open-source route, which signals to me anyway that he is going to choose to eschew the "product gimmick" route as the way to promote its adoption in favor of a more "institutional" approach.  Just my 2 cents, however, I can't speak for the guy.....<br><br><b>Edit:</b>  WHEW I sure said a mouthful.  Just wanted to throw in there that I agree with what skn3 and Samah have said in the past couple posts as well. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Similar things would be great for the Monkey ecosystem, and I have said all along that it would be even greater if we could somehow facilitate that right here on the site (with the help of some web-savvy developer) by making the commercial arm of the product become a portal for all things Monkey.

I use the best tool for the job and if you cannot understand that then thats our problem. Also it wasnt a threat to leave the community I did for a while it was Mr Wickers comments made against me regarding a KeyGen that made me return. I havent use BRL products in a major way since 2009, why because they dont bring anything new to the table. Max was marks last brilliant language, monkeyx is good for prototyping and testing on tablets but for 2d only but I tend to use other systems these days.

Perhaps the "3d or not 3d" issue can now be laid to rest for the time being..? I very much want to help with Monkey2 however I can, even though I'm not a language designer and have little-to-no formal programming skills in that area.  I hope that others in this thread are of the same mindset as well, regardless of their personal priorities.<br><br><strike>By the way.... Before Monkey, I was still using Multimedia Fusion to make games.  It has quite a number of limitations, but one thing I did find superb before I made the switch was the way it handled shaders.  Shaders in MMF were written in HLSL, and you "plugged them in" using a specific syntax to an existing system which let you apply a shader to any arbitrary surface in its system.  This meant sprites, backgrounds, layers, and the main drawing surface.  Main disadvantage:  Variables had to be defined twice - once in a MMF-friendly metadata file, and again in the shader for MMF to send the proper values to the shader program.<br><br>I don't know what the targets for monkey2 are going to be, but allowing some sort of specially-formatted GLSL to be loaded and attached to an Image or the main surface would probably give people 99% of the functionality they'd want out of it.  If that breaks with the spirit of the language then perhaps there's a way to let that "megashader" be semi-programmable in Monkey itself at least, as without programmability,  it's unlikely anything can be implemented that the OGL people didn't already think of in version 1.1 with the finite state machine.  I'm guessing that you'd have to generate intermediate shader scripts anyway if you plan to support them at all, so why not allow the user to override it with a specially-crafted one at design time and let them handle the x-platform discrepancies themselves?</strike>   IDK, food for thought, but something which probably should be in a separate, future thread...<br><br><b>@edzUp</b><br>Monkey already exposes OpenGL ES 1.1 and 2.0.  I also hope that for Monkey2, the full OpenGL will be exposed, as this is the minimum necessary to set the casual coder on his way should he want and try to climb that mountain himself.  But I can live without it "for now" while the language itself is under development.  It seems like it would be a given, in any case, as exposing OpenGL to 'monkey managed' code would be important for testing Monkey's capabilities before a full mojo port / rewrite is available. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I also cant agree more that If 3D is what your looking for then Unity would be a better option for example (at least for now). When you think about it taking on language development and developing or even implementing 3D in addition is a lot for one guy to do. ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
