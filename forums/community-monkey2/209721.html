And it was right, HTML5 is a good thing... mostly for website. I would never been able to write the game that I want even with the current performance of HTML5 (especially now that I've done a few mobile games and get disappointed by the general performances :).<br><br>Unfortunately, back in the day, I had a few Linux users asking me to support drivers I couldn't use in BlitzMax. A few general users asking for modern features and I was stuck... So I had to learn another language to continue my learning and choose C# so I could eventually run into IT on bad days. After looking at how Monkey X turns out (and how many times I really used it) I think I it was a good choice.<br><br>Now about Monkey 2... or "BlitzMax 3" ? :-D<br>To me (read IMO), since it's an open source project, it's quite simple : just keep going on the nice Monkey X language, support a good IDE (e.g. Eclipe, better : Atom.io) and port a robust game engine (e.g. LibGDX).<br><br>There's no way I could go back to a brand new language without a top notch IDE and a huge range of basic needs.<br>You create excellent languages : give them excellent IDE and engine !<br>Think about the time needed to reach this at a decent level and see what's best ;-)<br><br>Ps: I also like the idea of using Qt as a game UI. Most in-game UI today are bad. <b>The best would be supporting something like <a href="https://coherent-labs.com/" target="_blank">CoherentUI</a>.</b> All the best things of the web instantly available in your game or app. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Depending on the complexity of the code, it can be a waste of time. In fact, while IMHO having public or protected defined a la Monkey 1 is not the best option, making the same for Protected seems a lot more weird to me, and I see no benefits unless you love the mouse scrollwheel.<br><br>I would go for defining a default visibility behavior and requiring an identifier in every class member that does not have the default defined visibility. Make "Public" the default one, and expect people to mark as Private or Protected only encapsulated members. This is usually less typing too, but much more consistent and less disperse.<br><br>That said, I think putting the visibility identifier before the member allows for motr natural read of the code as it will resemble much more natural English.<br><br>EDIT: Also, what about classes? Are their going to be pubic or private depending of something defined several lines before and maybe several classes and functions before? And what would be the default visibility for their members if they do not have a visibility identifier, inherited from class visibility? At the end, not easy to know if something is public or not unless you start searching in the code. Not the nicest thing on earth if you ask me!<br><br>EDIT2: I've read in your other post that you'll be leaving the "block" mode as you're too used to it. I respect and understand this, but it's a very poor argument! Lots of people were used to GOTO and GOSUB statements XD (No offense intended, just that what one's used to is not a valid argument).

This includes some changes to the syntax which would break existing Monkey1 code, so as a result, the language has been split into an intended predecessor and successor.  Which one you go with depends on when you decide to get "into" the language, and what your intents are.  Until MX2 reaches a more mature state of development, there's really no way to know whether MX2 will take off.  Some people will stick with Monkey for practical reasons, and others won't migrate until they're able to have certain frameworks available.<br><br>Mark's doing what he can to make sure that external libraries are easy to access and work with in MX2, which is supposedly far superior to the way it's currently done in Monkey.  This might encourage faster adoption of the language.  But most of the syntax and feature improvements I've been reading about are ones that probably aren't of much interest to you if you're an "oldschool" programmer.  Many new functionalities cover new-ish programming concepts that you would never see in any older BASIC syntax, so any simplification will boil down to the libraries available to you at the time you adopt the language. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
