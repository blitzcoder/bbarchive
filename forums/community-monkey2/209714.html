They force people to organize their code or else make a huge mess of extra lines, and languages that use this syntax tend to also enforce this organization.  Requiring a bunch of access modifiers on every definition line would definitely make coding more tedious, and I'm not sure I want to go back to that way of doing things!  Proper Monkey looks more tidy, even if that makes it difficult on people whose coding style likes to lump members together by related functionality regardless of access level.<br><br>I'll also throw my hat in there that I like the overridable-by-default nature of Monkey;  you can tell who is most comfortable in certain languages in here based on the fact they're being referred to as virtual methods, as if the natural state of things in 2015 is that methods should be explicitly marked overridable. I imagine that these sorts of safety-features only existed mainly to avoid hazards from language features like multiple inheritance that almost everyone agrees now isn't a very good idea.  I believe this fundamental change to the default access level for every method out there is neither necessary nor warranted.<br><br>As for properties!  I started writing a post about them in the language features thread before I stumbled across here, and I'm happy to see that we may be seeing a more advanced property syntax in Monkey2.  (One can only hope!)  Mark, if you would please have a gander at <a href="http://www.monkey-x.com/Community/posts.php?topic=9711&amp;post=102353" target="_blank">this post</a>, you can see a couple more syntax suggestions.  One uses a similar Get/Set syntax as Samah's suggestion, based on how VB.NET does it;  the other uses a more Python-style / Monkey scope directive-style way of defining getter/setter blocks and is nice and tidy. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's not "virtual by default", it's "mutable by default". I honestly don't see the point of a "Virtual" or "Override" keyword, as it's counter intuitive to Monkey's current method system. The biggest downside to the way Monkey does it right now is the fact that you have to assume (At worst possible conditions) that a virtual call is taking place, if you don't explicitly declare a method as 'Final'. With Monkey's current source generation system, optimization through encapsulation goes straight out the window. Basically, the only classes that don't have implied virtual calls are the classes at the end of the inheritance tree. These days, compilers like g++, MSVC, and Clang have steps to reduce virtual calls, but most of those optimizations are completely useless to Monkey. There's really just no way to know the context an object is being used in, unless the compiler understands that it's an encapsulated situation beforehand. Basically, in Monkey, methods are a mutable construct, but out of Monkey, the mindset's different.<br><br>I guess it really depends on how far down the compatibility rabbit hole Mark wants to go. Personally, I think source-to-source from the current version of Monkey to Monkey2 is the best idea for compatibility. My personal take on the explicit "Virtual" keyword is the opposite. Make methods the same kind of dynamic construct they are now, but make 'Final' (Or a different keyword) denote that the method will not be used virtually from that stage in the inheritance tree.<br><br>Oh, and just to make this clear, having 'Public', 'Private', 'Protected', etc, on the same line is not only ugly to me, but it makes everything a mess. That especially applies to consistency in your own code. There's a reason C++ doesn't force you to write 'public' everywhere in a class, it just adds clutter. I think people's problems with 'Public' and 'Private' are more of an organization thing. You should dedicate areas to be public and private, not using them all over the place. Having "in-line" scope specifiers would be a nice option, though. Personally, I don't think we need them, but some may disagree. And honestly, readability shouldn't matter over write-ability. <b>I don't think "Public Virtual Method Name:Type() Override" looks good at all</b>, and when you add C++'s not so amazing "= 0" syntax, you're asking for trouble. Not just from a readability standpoint, but also writing that tons of times. Keep the 'Abstract' keyword, please. And I'd like to not have to write a ton of characters to do the same thing. You could have similar control treating methods the other way; explicitly stating if they're final / at the end of the "virtual scope".<br><br>Also, @Nobuyuki: Multiple inheritance is great when used correctly, but I agree that Monkey doesn't need it. Well, other than interfaces, but they can be over used at times. Mark said he wanted to add delegates of some sort, so that would probably fix my problems with interfaces. I'll just stick to my generic "node-based" class structure (Which I hope will work with Monkey2). Changing how properties work is probably for the best, though.<br><br>Alright, there's too much to cover, so I'll leave it at that. Good to hear about the new project, Mark. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
