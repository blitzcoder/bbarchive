The compiler really needs assignment to work 'as expected' for several operations such as initializing variables, copying temporaries around etc. This differs from "operator+" etc in that the compiler doesn't depend on these in any way. In fact, by the time the code is translated these have been converted to simple method calls. Not so assignment which is a 'real' backend op and can do 'magic' things that a normal method can't.<br><br>Overloading assignment doesn't even make much sense for reference types, eg:<br><br><pre class=code>
Class C
   Field x:T
   Method Assign( c:C )
      Self.x=x
   End
End

Function Main()
   Local c:C
   c=New C    'Null object error!
End
</pre><br><br>It makes more sense for structs, but again it's something that's incredibly useful for the compiler to have control over, so it can safely create as many 'temporaries' as it wants, reliably initialize vars and so on. I guess the compiler could in theory have an 'internal' assignment op, but depending on what you're doing this may defeat the purpose of taking over assignment (eg: smart pointers).<br><br>In my experience, in about 93% of cases assignment overloading (in c++ anyway) is used to perform automatic type conversions, eg:<br><br><pre class=code>
Struct Vec3
End

Struct Vec4
   Method Assign( v:Vec3 )   'prob. not a good idea...
   End
End
</pre><br><br>I'm am not totally against custom automatic conversions (although I'm less keen on them than I used to be) but I don't think this is the right way to do it. Instead, I think something like this would be better:<br><br>'global automatic conversion function<br>Function To:Vec4( v:Vec3 )<br>    Return New Vec4( v,1 )<br>End<br><br>But that's a way off yet. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

However, Monkey doesn't really need R-values as much as it needs C++'s optimization of R-values on the backend. I'd definitely think assignment operator overloading for structures should be a thing, though.<br><br>As for what Danilo was trying to explain, he's talking about deep copies vs. shallow copies. In the case of using pointers or highly controlled references for heap-based storage, having the assignment/copy constructor perform a deep copy of everything is ideal.<br><br>However, this doesn't have much to do with move-semantics, and has much more to do with state-coherence. In other words, having the structures keep their behavior regardless of copies. A trait that would need heavy personal control over shallow copies, and when they should happen.<br><br>In the case of C++ you have move semantics to go a step further, but I think the simplest way to handle this is a copy-constructor. I haven't been keeping up with Monkey too much, but wouldn't a copy-constructor effectively be the same thing as your 'To' function? It makes sense to me to have this constructor for better control of resources. For classes, definitely not, but for structures, this is ideal.<br><br>Trust me, your reservations toward assignment operators and copy constructors are nothing compared to the bugs associated with only having raw copies of structures everywhere. Just imagine if one decided to destroy a resource while a copy lived somewhere waiting to be used incorrectly. C++ already has move semantics, so the reduction of extra copies is already mostly implicit. Sure, you wouldn't be able to take full advantage of it, but we also have other means to that end anyway.<br><br>By the way, I'm sure this has been asked already, but any thoughts about BlitzMax's 'Var' coming back?<br><br>Structures lose a lot of their modern uses without temporary references. As long as you restrict getting a pointer to a "struct-reference", you'd never have the problem of incorrect storage. Even if you didn't restrict raw memory access to struct-references, it's not like it's much of a pitfall. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
