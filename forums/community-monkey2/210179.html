Do I have to add a bunch of '#Imports' into my programs, or can I use it like 'Import' works now. That is, should existing code use '#Import', or 'Using'. Is 'Using' only going to be a global thing, or is it a matter of putting your game-code into a single namespace? Or am I misinterpreting, and #Import is supposed to be the answer to the old import-system ala 'Include', but closer to Monkey 1? Have you given it enough thought yet, or is it something you're still sorting out?<br><br>Also, will the new override behavior (Assuming it's staying, which sounds pretty good to me) cause errors when you don't use the keyword? Because that'd help with porting old code over. Is 'Strict' also going to cause errors, because again, that'd help moving forward.<br><br>Another question is, where does Mojo 2 sit right now? Mojo 1 (Graphics) compatibility isn't a big deal, we can already <a href="https://github.com/Regal-Internet-Brothers/mojoinmojo2" target="_blank">wrap Mojo 2</a> pretty easily. But, will it be completely open source? Will Monkey 1 go completely open source after Monkey 2 is stable?<br><br>Sorry for the long chain of questions, but this is sort of coming out of nowhere. I didn't even realize you were posting in this thread before seeing the GitHub notifications. We definitely need a sticky thread or announcement, even if it has a disclaimer. This is great, and I love the way the language is going. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Do I have to add a bunch of '#Imports' into my programs, or can I use it like 'Import' works now. That is, should existing code use '#Import', or 'Using'.<br><br>#import "blah" means 'add this file to the project'. I think of it as a kind of low-level project management directive. Stuff imported this way could theoretically be handled by an IDE, and stored in .project files of some type. An IDE could even generate a makefile.monkey2 that includes all these #imports for you so you didn't even have to type them - or, mx2cc could be passed multiple monkey2 files to compile or something. That's the rough idea anyway, for now #import is the only way to add files to a project.<br><br>Using means 'look for symbols in this namespace'. You can also use 'Namespace' at the top of a file to declare what namespace the file's symbols belong to. Symbols within a namespace can automatically 'see' any other symbols in the same (or any outer) namespace without having to use a 'Using'. Symbols in a different namespace can be accessed either via a Using, or can be reference by 'namespace path'. See the 'std.math.Sqrt' examples above...<br><br>There is also a default namespace which symbols are dumped into if you don't use Namespace at the top of your file, which allows you to write stuff without having to worry about namespaces, very much like blitzmax (I think). Symbols in different files that don't declare a Namespace can then automatically see each other since they're in the same (ie: default) namespace. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Monkey 1 only compiles referenced code (Excluding reflection). Either way, not using a derived class doesn't affect initial code generation. It's only the inlined cases that really leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. That being said, I'm on the line about this. There are some definite benefits of "non-virtual by default", but virtual calls only have overhead when they've actually been overridden. In a situation where you don't intend for the user to override a method, or extend a class, you should either mark that as such ('Final'), or provide a disclaimer in your docs.<br><br>The big thing I'm worried about is Monkey 2's build system. It's translation-based, but I imagine it doesn't really perform optimizations. Because elements would be built separately, the best a compiler could do to combat the potential virtual calls is to inline/optimize internal uses, but also generate versions for the internal ABI, so code in other objects can link to it. So you might think "final by default" is the best way to do this. Except, it isn't. Though there might be something to say about the design portion, the build system argument doesn't always hold up. Link-time optimization has been huge in MSVC and GCC for a long time now, and is used to help resolve this kind of issue. And since we'll be using O2 or O3 optimization with g++, there's good reason to expect the AST to be broken down well enough to see the static uses of things like interfaces, abstract classes, and even abstract methods. The biggest crutches of virtual methods are dynamic storage and callbacks. A stack of interface references can't just be optimized down. The only exception is when the interface is representing a single type, but that'd probably require stack allocation, and insane optimization (O3 and possibly some extra flags). Function calls on the other hand, would be easily optimizable. There's also the fact that if a virtual call needs to be done anywhere for a class, it's stuck with an entry in the V-table, even if it's inlined everywhere else.<br><br>Just my two cents. But I do think with the inclusion of '#Import' and 'Using', we'll be seeing a pretty much equal benefit-to-disadvantage ratio. When in doubt, let GCC handle it, I suppose. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I will concede the point that writing methods without regards to whether potential subclasses will override them in the future could cause potentially greater headaches down the line. It still feels like a more hypothetical thing for monkey's most common use case scenarios than a serious issue necessitating the change.<br><br> Either way though, I know for sure that I find it far easier to write extensible code in monkey than I do in VB, because it lets me iterate faster without getting in the way of my tinkering. For the longest time, I avoided overriding methods due to it being a chore to do so in VB. It's not exactly encouraged, but there are multiple incongruities in the syntax that can make writing classes in VB a chore, so I guess maybe that experience is not directly applicable.<br><br><b>Edit</b>:  To add to that, that ad-hoc approach to writing classes is also one of the major reasons I lobbied for having the Protected qualifier in the language.  Sometimes I "just don't know" if I'm going to want to extend a class in the future, and I like being able to hide fields from external classes without being forced to re-implement functionality in a subclass or refactor.  I'm aware that some of the same people who have no use for Protected are some of the same people advocating for the virtual method change now.

And the other is associated with Java, Python, Ruby, etc. In that generation of languages, the standouts are c# and Delphi, both, funny enough, designed by the same guy. Newer languages seem to get around this by avoiding some of the typical oop paradigms altogether. <br><br>Your comparison is apt where it applies to which approach should be taken based upon what the language is going to likely be used for, and by whom. If we do go with non-virtual by default along with explicit override keyword pairing, I would hope that we eventually see something like rust traits enter the language, so that people still have the freedom to tinker around with stuff without having to design it like it's going to be used in an enterprise production environment first. It feels like it's a reach to compare the current behavior to the other features which are going to be (or already have been) removed.<br><br>@gerry: totally hear ya. Same thing for the data[] member on stacks before mark switched its visibility to public. That would have been a perfect place to change its visibility to protected, since most people who wanted access to that member wanted to directly manipulate the data for implementing an extension of their own stack class based off the default implementation.

But it got me thinking of how the language got to where it is today. 'Protected' is brand new. It's fantastic, but it's also completely shifted the way I build modules, and for the better. For simple classes, you override public methods (And to a lesser extent, properties) pretty often; but for larger framework classes, I only ever have users override protected methods if they want to extend the framework. The main reason being that the protected methods act as the extension-API (Unless marked as 'Final', undocumented, or otherwise noted as "unsafe"). Whereas the public methods act as the user-level API (Also accessed occasionally from other access-levels), and the private methods are dedicated to internal routines. Usually, through core routines that shouldn't be extended, only used by protected elements, or by base-implementations that the framework requires to be called, or behavior will be undefined.<br><br>The big thing I take away from this process is that, though public methods are overridden a lot by programmers, protected methods are usually the correct way to go for large frameworks. Which brings me to the conclusion that since "calling up" is very common practice, maybe the best way to allow extension is to sandbox the right amount of your framework, and though you should allow overriding, it should be opt-in for the developer. <b>That being said</b>, I think there's a good way to get around this practice's shortcomings; <b>"extensible methods"</b>. Basically, extension without altering protected or publicly delegated behavior; opt-in function injection, in a sense (Just with proper barriers, and potentially, framework-devs would be the ones who opt-in). In other words, constructor behavior, but for methods. Of course, this shouldn't be a default trait to overriding, but I do think it's worth looking into. It'd add a lot of safety, and it would stop bugs where the super-method was intended to be called, but wasn't. I'm sure there's a better way to describe this in the language (Call-backs, etc), but it's an interesting idea when looking at inheritance stability. And having this as a part of the language would definitely streamline the process.<br><br>My dreams aside, I think you guys have a point, we shouldn't bombard Mark out of the gate. That being said, he doesn't have to listen to <i>everything</i> we suggest, and that's usually what happens. So, I don't see how discussing potential fixes is a big deal. But yeah, we might want to make some more threads about this, rather than flood what has become the main thread.<br><br>I should also bring up what I believe Mark brought up, D has already faced a number of these issues, and has gone in a great direction with them. But, it also doesn't have a lot of baggage, which is why a lot of "modern C++" guys see it as a solid alternative. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I do want monkey2 to feature a much more robust set of classes that can be more easily extended where necessary, so I am giving much more thought to the 'virtual interface' stuff this time around.

Especially the graphic engines modules.<br><br>I think this is precisely because I didn't give enough thought to how exactly these classes could/should be extended. The combination of all virtual methods and all public fields is incredibly flexible in a way(!) but it means there are really 'no rules' when it comes to extending graphics (or in fact any bmx classes). It also means it's very hard to sanely tweak or enhance such classes, as there may be subclasses out there overriding ANY method (or accessing any public field in the case of bmx), and expect those methods to 'behave' exactly the same way, everytime.<br><br>Contrast this to my prototype of a 'View' class in mojo, which has just a handful of virtual methods: OnMeasure, OnLayout, OnRender, and some OnEvent methods. Everything's architectured around these methods *being* virtual, which gives me a huge amount of flexibility when it comes to adding stuff to View, or changing how it works internally etc. IMO, it's a better design, and the way I plan to design other stuff from now on.<br><br>&gt; For example, an annoyance for me is that nodes and their fields are private on Monkey.List. I could use access to those when I'm extending List.<br><br>Unless you're arguing for removal of 'final' and 'private' altogether, I think this is really just a case of a design decision you don't agree with. Which is fine (I might even agree!), but I do think solutions to problems like 'I want to do XYZ with this class' should be dealt with on a case by case basis, as opposed to just making everything virtual (or protected or whatever) in the first place 'just in case'.<br><br>&gt; But I can also see that, if misused, it could also lead to poor designs and frustration.<br><br>IMO making a method final if you're not sure whether it's going to be overridden or not (and you care about this stuff) is a win/win, because while you can always convert a final method to virtual later on without any risk of breaking existing subclasses, the opposite is not always true. <br><br>But yeah, if you don't care, having to mark everything virtual is annoying. As is having to mark almost everything final if you do care. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In C#, by contrast, instance methods are non-virtual by default. To make a method virtual, the programmer must explicitly declare it virtual. Why is non-virtual the default in C#?<br><br><br>There are several reasons. One is performance. We can observe that as people write code in Java, they forget to mark their methods final. Therefore, those methods are virtual. Because they're virtual, they don't perform as well. There's just performance overhead associated with being a virtual method. That's one issue.<br><br>A more important issue is versioning. There are two schools of thought about virtual methods. The academic school of thought says, "Everything should be virtual, because I might want to override it someday." The pragmatic school of thought, which comes from building real applications that run in the real world, says, "We've got to be real careful about what we make virtual."<br><br>When we make something virtual in a platform, we're making an awful lot of promises about how it evolves in the future. For a non-virtual method, we promise that when you call this method, x and y will happen. When we publish a virtual method in an API, we not only promise that when you call this method, x and y will happen. We also promise that when you override this method, we will call it in this particular sequence with regard to these other ones and the state will be in this and that invariant.<br><br>Every time you say virtual in an API, you are creating a call back hook. As an OS or API framework designer, you've got to be real careful about that. You don't want users overriding and hooking at any arbitrary point in an API, because you cannot necessarily make those promises. And people may not fully understand the promises they are making when they make something virtual.<br> <br></div><br><br><a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/nonvirtualP.html" target="_blank">http://www.artima.com/intv/nonvirtualP.html</a><br><br><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/973240/why-in-java-functions-are-written-virtual-by-default-and-c-sharp-nonvirtual" target="_blank">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/973240/why-in-java-functions-are-written-virtual-by-default-and-c-sharp-nonvirtual</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It somehow felt as a limited and isolated solution. I can't imagine many users making heavy usage of it. I would need more time to answer this more properly though.<br><br>I haven't used Max/monkey for some time (except for educational purposes) but the way i remember SetScale from Max, it was easier to grasp, setting the scale to 4,4, draw something increased, set scale back to 1,1, everything was fine. With monkey you Scale and from there on it also had an influence on the calculations of the positions of other stuff you were drawing and you couldn't reset it back to normal just by (1,1), instead you need to shrink it back by the same factor (maybe therefore it's Scale instead of SetScale like SetBlend/SetColor/...).<br><br>DrawText could be way better, so that you want to use it apart from debugging. A.o. a lack of blendmodes (alpha), the calculations of the size of the drawn string, alignment, signed distance fields, ... saying so it would be nice having easy options to set colours in hex/float(0-1)/hsv apart from 0-255 as well (yeah, i know that i can make my own types and classes).

Of course if there are deep references you would probably have to allocate several pools at the start and hope for the best.

While not all targets offer the necessary finesse, as you say, it would be nice if M2's more abstract features were balanced out with some low level control where supported. (More than that, actually -- a high level language that let you map out memory allocation for cache efficiency would be bleeding-edge... does anybody else offer this ATM?)<br><br>Re hacking the C++ target: A thousand billion times no!

And Monkey by its nature resembles Java quite a lot - converting to C++ is the most 'distant' translation it does, and only possible really because of the incredible flexibility and expressiveness of C++ which can have efficient abstractions that come half-way to emulate the Java-like Monkey model.  Imagine if Monkey had a pure C target - Mark would have to write the equivalent of a JVM to make it work!<br><br>I could imagine a multi-platform language designed to minimise memory allocation / fragmentation.  But I do not think it would resemble Monkey-X...  Maybe it could be called Monkey-C!  Syntactically, it might resemble a '90s version of Basic, with structs and pointers or 'sorta-pointers' but no real objects.  Maybe someone could make a module that manages a DataBuffer in interesting ways? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That's probably anathema to the lowest-common-denominator sensibilities of Monkey, but cache efficiency is a pretty big limb to cut off just because Java is a bit naff in this respect. I dunno, this wasn't even on my radar when Monkey was released and yet now, a scant few years down the track, it feels like a significant omission for any new release.

I think the next evolutionary step for cross compilers would be to allow Monkey-like syntax alongside efficient memory mapping on targets that support it and maybe even implementations of features that weren't one-to-one mappings of (oft costly) abstractions. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
