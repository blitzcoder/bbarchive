Though instead of building a full functioning editor/ide, IMO you should follow the Atom or MSCode model and build a core and standards that can be extended with plugins(or just code) built by us.  I can think of 100 things that should be added to that editor and that's, not only a lot of work... some people just don't want the same things I do.  so don't waste you time with code folding (something I never use), etc... or intelisense which I love, but not when it's in my face all the time so I'd like it dock-able.  another, smooth scrolling... there's no way you should waste your time with that, but if you give us the hooks we'll do it...  <br><br>The GUI stuff is pretty sweet actually, I like the way if feels.<br><br>The real-time debugger sounds great... what about hooking in profiler too.... :)<br><br>I didn't see any mention of closures though...

The idea is to not think too much about how your program solves a problem. Instead you focus on the expected result / algoritm and all the dirty stuff happens under hood. This results in more readable code which is closer to the actual problem you are solving. The Lamda in this example takes 0 parameters and thus can be stored in the Triggered Field because it fits the definition<br><pre class=code>

So it must be assigned a function, and this what 'Triggered=Lambda()...' is doing - assigning a 'lambda function' to the Triggered field of the action returned by AddAction. It's really no different from something like: AddEntity( "MyEntity!" ).X=100.0, only it's assigning a function to a field instead of a float. You can assign any kind of function to Action.Triggered, eg: a global 'Function', a member 'Method', a temporary 'Lambda' or a value from an existing 'function variable'. Here, I've chosen to use a Lambda function.<br><br>The best way to think of a Lambda function is probably just as a 'temporary' function. This code inside a Lambda function can 'see' outer locals and fields (actually, it only sees a 'snapshotted' version of outer locals...), so in this case when the Lambda function function calls 'Okay()' it is indeed calling the outer 'Okay:Void()' field - yet another function variable that code 'outside' the dialog can assign a function to. In other words, when 'client code' creates a NotifyDialog, it'll do something like this:<br><br><pre class=code>
Local dialog:=New NotifyDialog
dialog.Okay=Lamba()
    Print "Okay!"
End
</pre><br><br>(Is it 'right' to use public fields for things like 'Okay', 'Triggered' etc like this? Possibly not, but I'm sticking with it for now.)<br><br>A lot of this is inspired by Qt, which calls such function pointer fields like Triggered:Void() and Okay:Void() 'signals', and you connect them up to special 'slot' methods. In mx2, you can still think of 'Triggered' and 'Okay' as signals (and I'll probably end up referring to them as such in the docs) only you can connect them up to any kind of function, not just special 'slot' functions.<br><br>In this case the code is, in a sense, 'converting' one kind of signal (Action.Triggered) into another, more specific signal (NotifyDialog.Okay). Actually, Action.Triggered is itself just responding to a Button.Clicked signal, so when the user actually clicks on the Okay button, the actual 'flow' of signals is:<br><br>Button.Clicked -&gt; Action.Triggered -&gt; NotifyDialog.Okay -&gt; Your dialog 'okay' handling code!<br><br>(Eventually, you'l be able to assign 'hotkeys' to actions, so Action.Triggered may not be always be caused by a button click).<br><br>A simpler example of signal use is a button, that has a 'Clicked()' Signal:<br><br><pre class=code>
Local button:=New Button( "My Button" )
button.Clicked=Lambda()
   'when the button is clicked, this code is run!
   'the code can see the 'button' var, and, if we're in a  method, the fields of the object.

How mature is the current parser? Is it very subject to change? I want to get a Jungle ide parser for it ASAP.

Some languages allow for single-line lambdas where data kind returned is inferred by the expression, and where Return sentence is avoided:<br><br><pre class=code>Local myFunction := Lambda(item:Int) item &lt; 2</pre><br>This would be a lambda that gets an integer and returns a boolean. Return keyword is avoided as it is "a single expression" lambda.<br><br>That's ultra handy with collections, where you can do quite complex logic in a very simple way.

....
Local firstItemStartingWithM := myList.First(Lambda(item) item.StartsWith("M"))</pre><br><br>Notice that, In this case, the "item" parameter data kind is inferred by its usage. The function First is defined like: List.First:Bool(condition:Bool(T)), so the anonymous function parameters and return type can be inferred by the function where they appear as a parameter, that is, the "First" function definition of the List object.<br><br>This alows for ultra nice expressions to do things like get if any item of a collection accomplish a given condition:<br><br><pre class=code>if myStringsList.Any(Lambda(item) item.Trim().Length=0) Then Print "The list has empty strings!!"</pre><br><br>Or much more complex logic expressed in a very simple way.<br>That can be very handy (I know my examples are very sily, but I gess it shows the idea). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It can be done with the existing system, but it's not too pretty.<br><br>A simple-ish way to achieve this would be to add an 'Async' modifier for functions (that, for the sake of this discussion, must return Void) and would mean the function would execute as a coroutine so could safely 'block'. Blocking could be achieved via semaphores or Future&lt;T&gt; objects. ConfirmDialog.Run() might look like:<br><br><pre class=code>
Function Run:Int( title:String )

         Case 1
            file.Save()
         Case 0
         Case -1
            Exit
         End
      Endif
End
</pre><br><br>Some 'Wait' functions might look like:<br><br><pre class=code>
Function Wait( seconds:Double )
   Local result:=New Semaphore
   New OneShotTimer( seconds ).Ticked=Lambda()
      result.Signal()
   End
   result.Wait()
End
</pre><br><br><pre class=code>
Function WaitIdle()
   Local result:=New Semaphore
   App.Idle+=Lambda()   'App.Idle is the nearest monkey2 has to an 'update tick' right now!
      result.Signal()
   End
   result.Wait()
End
</pre><br><br>...which could be used like:<br><br><pre class=code>
Function LevelComplete() Async
   
   MainView.Content=LevelCompleteView   'show LevelComplete page...
   Wait( 5 )   'wait 5 seconds
   For Local y:=0 Until MainView.Height  'slide down...
      MainView.y=y
      WaitIdle()   'VWait

         'update stuff here...
         WaitIdle()
      Wend
   End

End
</pre><br><br>Probably not a good idea if you end up with tons of landers, which would mean tons of threads, but an interesting approach!<br><br>This is just one potential approach of course. The Semaphore/Future stuff is a bit icky, but this is low level code and most people wont be writing 'wait functions' like this. But I at least have to so I need to consider how everything works behind the scenes. It would also be nice to roll 'generators' into this too, but I haven't given that much thought yet.<br><br>This approach also means that if you forget to make a key function 'async' you can quite easily block the gui thread or worse - eg: If OnCloseAll above weren't async, the app would deadlock!<br><br>Perhaps Async could also be used to call a function, ensuring it ran on it's own thread? More thought required here obviously...!<br><br>&gt; yield SomeFunction()<br>&gt; which can then get us... <br>&gt; yield nextUpdate() ' until next update<br>&gt; yield nextFixedUpdate()<br><br>Still a bit confused about this - what's the different between 'yield SomeFunction' and just calling 'SomeFunction'?

In Unity this functionality might be built in their own Coroutine class and on top of C# coroutines.  But it really should just be part of the language.<br><br><div class="quote"> Directed coroutines: ... Also, the syntax is different; the generator uses the "yield" command to transfer control to the parent; the parent uses the next() method of the generator to transfer control to the generator.  <br></div>http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CoRoutine<br><br>https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_QRDVR7hgC&amp;pg=PA257&amp;lpg=PA257&amp;dq=coroutines+specify+when+resume&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5K5Xn6abTD&amp;sig=Xfc4wP-TDTqGjxtKY1wpDn28CHo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_jJvQwoTKAhUK6iYKHTs4CtoQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=coroutines%20specify%20when%20resume&amp;f=false<br>-1972 :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I like that for a lot of things but not this type of thing... Coroutines, on the other hand can fix that as there shouldn't be hardly any overhead.<br><br>By 'fiber', I mean 'coroutine'. The 2 are pretty much the same thing. And any c# method with a 'yield' in it is effectively a coroutine too.<br><br>There are a number of ways to implement coroutines though, such as c#'s 'state machine' approach but I wont be doing that. I'll probably start with trying to adapt ordinary threads, and later on doing it in ASM, ie: easiest way I can think of first!<br><br>The key thing is that each 'coroutine' has (conceptually anyway - the state machine approach achieves the same thing) it's own little 'stack', and that they can pass the CPU around to each other.<br><br>I actually implemented a simple coroutine system in BlitzPlus - I basically chopped the stack in half, ran the 'event loop' code on one half of the stack and user code on the other. This is how BlitzPlus could handle window resize events in realtime without having to be callback based. There's also a proposal for adding async/await to c++, and in fact I believe MS already have an implementation going using fibers (can't find the exact page): <a href="https://paoloseverini.wordpress.com/2014/04/22/async-await-in-c/" target="_blank">https://paoloseverini.wordpress.com/2014/04/22/async-await-in-c/</a><br><br>I still find Unity's 'Yield' approach odd - found quite a good write up on it here: <a href="http://m.blog.csdn.net/blog/StupidCodeGenerator/11526285" target="_blank">http://m.blog.csdn.net/blog/StupidCodeGenerator/11526285</a><br><br>It could just be that Unity was based on C# 3.5 or whatever (before Async and Await) and therefore they had no choice but to use the IEnumerator approach to get coroutines. Dunno, but I definitely find this sort of code easier to understand:<br><br><pre class=code>
Method LevelComplete() Async

   MainView=LevelCompleteView  'change main view.

   Wait( 5 )  'wait 5 seconds.

   For Local y:=0 Until MainView.Height

      MainView.Translate( 0,y )  'scroll main view down...

      Wait( 0 ) 'wait for next 'frame'.

   Next

End
</pre><br><br>...which I guess is moving more in the 'async/await' direction than 'IEnumerator'.<br><br>Anyway, I'm writing up a little proposal for how I think this all could work which I'll post later. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

(research) New Year! ;)<br><br>Yeah baby! 2016 should be very interesting!<br><br>&gt; it might be better to implement fibers on top of coroutines.<br><br>Ha, I've just done the complete opposite!<br><br>I decided to go for fibers first since the API (the win32 one anyway) is incredibly simple, and if C++ can build async/await on top of fibers, I might be able to too.<br><br>Here's the resultant, highly experimental fiber API:<br><br><pre class=code>
Function StartFiber:Int( entry:Void() )
Function SwitchToFiber:Void( fiber:Int )
Function GetCurrentFiber:Int()
</pre><br><br>(There will probably be CancelFiber too).<br><br>This is incredibly primitive - there is no 'scheduler' as such, but I kind of like that because we can build schedulers etc on top. It currently fakes fibers with threads but ensures that, like a real fibre or coroutine, there is only ever one fiber 'unblocked' at a time. The overhead of creating/switching fibers is likely to be quite high, but with some low down and dirty ASM is should be possible to reduce it to about that of a function call.<br><br>Fiber 0 is reserved for the main/gui fiber, which means SwitchToFiber( 0 ) will always switch to the gui fiber. This means fiber 0 *is* effectively the scheduler, and that sounds right to me. If all fibers are blocked, the ONLY thing that can unblock them is the gui thread, as ultimately all code execution begins from the gui event dispatch mechanism.<br><br>Anyway, I can now do this: it just 'fades in' the window color, but I think it's a very promising start:<br><br><pre class=code>
Class MyWindow Extends Window

	Method New()
		Super.New( "My Window",0,0,640,480,WindowFlags.Center )
		
		Destroyed=App.Terminate
		
		StartFiber( Yeehaa )

			ClearColor=New Color( 1,0,i/255.0,1 )
			App.RequestRender()
			WaitFrame()
		Next
	End
End
</pre><br><br>The implementation of WaitFrame is a little funky, but a lot of people wont care how it's implemented, and I'm confident utility funcs for 'Wait( some_generic_condition )' etc can be written to make this sort of stuff nicer.<br><br><pre class=code>
Function WaitFrame()

	Local fiber:=GetCurrentFiber()
	
	App.Idle+=Lambda()
		SwitchToFiber( fiber )

I go out for a few hours and bam! done! :)<br><br>Well, I'd already had a crack at 'real' threads (and given up on for now) so I sort of knew what to do. What surprised my was how easy it was to get Wait() going once fibers were in!<br><br>&gt; which would be a memory block copy and some jumps, right?<br><br>Yeah, switching fibers should only involve saving/restoring a bunch of CPU registers including SP and then JSR-ing. Creation is less of a problem because I can just use a 'thread pool'.<br><br>How many fibers do you expect to be running at once typically? I can see the overhead being significant for generators, but if you've only got a couple of fibers vwating, it's not that big a deal. Apart from 'fading out', what sort of things is this generally used for?<br><br>&gt; are you planning on building anything more to schedule them?<br><br>That's the cool thing about having such a small API - we can add stuff and mess with it as necessary quite easily. So if we find anything that would help, we can just bung it in there.<br><br>For example, I've solved the 'who goes next' problem for now by changing the fiber function so it returns a 'next fiber' int that controls which fiber goes next after this fiber has returned/completed - kind of a 'continuation' I guess. So most fibers can (probably) just return 0, while generators set a 'finished' flag and return to the parent fiber. It may turn out that the parent fiber ALWAYS goes next (or that it prevents fiber leaks to do so or something) but for now having that int in there allows us to experiment.<br><br>I think this is similar to your 'corethread' idea? Except I've done it this way:<br><br>StartFiber:Int( entry:Int() )<br><br>ie: entry returns the fiber to switch to AFTER it completes. I was initially doing something like<br><br><pre class=code>
GeneratorFiberCode()
   'do the 'yield' loop...
   _finished=true
   SwitchToFiber( _parent )
End
</pre><br><br>...but this leaks! The problem is the last SwitchToFiber 'suspends' the fiber, but there's nothing to resume it to allow it to actually return/exit. And if you try to resume it 'one last time' from the parent fiber, you end up with the opposite problem - the parent 'stalls'! So it now looks like this:<br><br><pre class=code>
GeneratorFiberCode:Int()  'returns fiber to switch to after we've finished and have been cleaned up/deallocated etc.
    'do the 'yield' loop
   _finished=True
  Return _parent
End
</pre><br><br>The are other ways to deal with this - your way, something like SetFiberNextFiber() etc - but I think we'll only find out the best way by playing with things.<br><br>I was planning on adding a CreateFiber() too, that works like StartFiber() but doesn't actually run the fiber until you explicitly SwitchToFiber. In which case, a fiber could end with...<br><br>Return CreateFiber( SomeOtherFunc )<br><br>...to 'chain' fibers together. But it turns out this is really unnecessary, as you're already running on a fiber so why bother creating a new one? You can just call SomeOtherFunc() directly before you exit instead. Still, CreateFiber can easily happen if there's a need for it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In particular, I get the 'paused pressed' issue can be complex!<br><br>For things like 'Destroyed', I'd tend towards using something like a 'signal' similar to Window.Destroyed instead, eg:<br><br><pre class=code>
'a signal! To 'raise', simply call GameOver().
Global GameOver:Void()

Class Actor

   'another object signal
   Field Destroyed:Void()

   Method New()

      GameOver+=Lambda()  'this adds a 'listener' to GameOver.
      End

      Destroyed+=Lambda()
         'ditto, this called when actor destroyed - maybe cancel fibers here? maybe have fibers groups? A fiber hierarchy?
      End

   End

End
</pre><br><br>It'd also be nice for a fiber to be able to 'wait' for a signal like this - shouldn't be hard although it may mean encapsulating the signal a bit for full flexibility. This is what WaitFrame() effectively does anyway, it just waits for the App.Idle signal.<br><br>Signals can often be used instead of fibers, eg: instead of starting a fiber and waiting on a signal, you can listen to a signal and (maybe) start a fiber when it fires, which is likely to be more efficient. Ted2 achieves a far amount of asynchronisity this way, but things get tricky when you want to do a 'blocking' loop, like for 'Close All Files'.<br><br>What I'm now planning to do here is something like:<br><br><pre class=code>
'what the 'CloseAll button' does..
CloseAllAction.Triggered=Lambda()   'when Close All is clicked...
   StartFiber( Lambda:Int()    'we start a fiber...
      '
      '...which can now 'block' without blocking the gui!
      '
   End )

I've actually been trying to nut out a way to serialize 'function pointer values' - something Qt does very well with its slots and signals - and this is related.

Even if it's not the GC and just some built in stuff behind the scenes that OnDestroy caches it.... I know it's trivial to add pooling to my classes but it's still a decent amount of code and this would make it real easy to make the pooling go deep.<br><br>- how about a Singleton keyword... New only ever gives you the initial allocation.  again, very easy to code but man, that would be clean and clear!<br><br>- the prototype pattern would be cool too but that would probably just go into a library with serialization. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But you can effectively think of it as a list/stack of functions.<br><br>App.Idle is automatically 'cleared' each time it's invoked, so if something wants to be called every App.Idle continuously it needs to keep using App.Idle+= over and over.<br><br>&gt; why Int's instead of object reference?<br><br>I did this because it allows StartFiber to return a unique id/handle for every fiber created. This int can be validated easily to make sure it really represents an active fiber, and not a fiber that may have exited or been canceled 'behind your back'. This means you can't accidentally, say, 'CancelFiber' a fiber that is no longer running.<br><br>This is a bit like audio systems that return a unique channel id when you use PlaySound. If the sound finishes, the id becomes invalid so you can't accidentally mess with a channel another sound may now be playing through.<br><br>I may eventually wrap this handle in an object and OO-ify the fiber interface a bit, but for now I'm keeping it simple. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Events are implemented as objects that extend the Event class and are 'received' by virtual view methods such OnKeyEvent, OnMouseEvent etc. So if you want to catch input events, then yes, you have to subclass something.<br><br>Signals are higher level and used to represent more abstract things like 'button clicked', 'scrollbar value changed' etc. Its really the job of 'control' style views to transform events into signals, eg: when a button receives a 'mouse down' event it emits a 'clicked' signal. Signals have no 'target' - a view emits signals without knowing/caring who is listening for the signal. This makes signals VERY flexible as they can be 'plugged into' any system since they don't care who/what is receiving the signals. Ideally, you should be able to build apps using only signals and not have to care about events.<br><br>Signals are implemented as function pointers, and emitting a signal simply involves 'calling' the function pointer. This will cause anything listening for the signal to execute. You can use = to assign a single listener to a signal, or += to add multiple listeners, eg:<br><br>Local button:=New Button<br>button.Clicked=OnClicked       'sets a single signal listener (note: will 'overwrite' any previous listener(s))<br>button.Clicked+=OnClicked2   'adds another listener<br>button.Clicked+=OnClicked3   'and another<br><br>...this code means 3 functions will be called when the button is clicked.<br><br>Also, in terms of naming conventions, I think it's best to save the 'On' prefix for signal listeners, not the signals themselves. eg: the button clicked signal is simply 'Clicked', not 'OnClicked', so when you go button.Clicked=OnBlahClicked it's kind of clearer .Perhaps it doesn't matter much, but it's what Qt does and I'm sticking with it myself!<br><br>&gt; I looked ad the source code (button.monkey2), and the field Clicked() has no parameter.<br><br>Well no, because a button has no 'value'. It's just a button, what value do you expect it to 'emit'?<br><br>If you could explain what you'd actually like to do I can perhaps be of more help!<br><br>&gt; Oh, OK, so it needs to change the OnMouseUp event... I'm sure I will break something.<br><br>The gui has been designed so it should be easy to subclass View. <br><br>You can start by copying and pasting the button class if you want, and renaming it 'MyButton' or something. Or you can extend Button. You don't have to modify mojo, you can add the new class to your own project. You can't accidentally override a critical or otherwise method, because you need to declare 'Override' when overriding an existing method, so it should all be relatively bulletproof.<br><br>Here's a little example of an 'IntField' class I whipped up, that allows you to change the value of an int by using the mousewheel when the pointer is on top of the view:<br><br><textarea class=codebox name="code" wrap=OFF readonly="true" rows="15" cols="80">

The easiest way would be to just auto-import ALL modules, which would work, but it will eventually start hurting link times badly.<br><br>What would be nice is for the IDE to present a 'uses modules' dialog in 'project settings', where the user can manually toggle modules on and off. VC and C# does this with assemblies, which are pretty much the same thing, and I think it works well. The IDE can then pass the modules list directly to mx2cc and the user never sees any of it.  <br><br>The problem is where to store this project meta data. Perhaps a separate 'blah.make.monkey2' file? The IDE could 'parse' this and present the 'build options' visually and allow the user to edit them. So the user wouldn't have to see this ugliness, but could still do so if they wanted for some reason to manually edit the 'project file'.<br><br>Dunno, this is still up in the air, but in the meantime ugly #import will remain! I actually like at the the '#' prefix, as it indicates to me this isn't a normal language construct - and it isn't, it's really an instruction to the build system.<br><br>Also note that #Imports only have to appear ONCE per project, not in every file. Multiple #imports of the same file are ignored, but perhaps they should error?<br><br>&gt; StartFiber:Int( entry:Void(), owner:T=null )<br><br>This would actually be hard/impossible to implement the way things work right now.  <br><br>For starters, the fiber itself would be keeping 'owner' alive so it would never be disposed. Even if the fiber somehow didn't keep owner alive, owner could still be recycled at any time - perhaps many times - before it is next 'polled'. So 'owner' may still refer to a valid object, just not the one it used to!<br><br>What would work here is something like a weak reference, and I've started having a few ideas of how these could work, and in a way that might reduce GC load considerably.<br><br>Keep spit balling!<br><br>&gt; so far I feared they might only be available for value types on the stack.<br><br>The main thing with structs is that 'New' always creates the struct on the stack. This works because the struct is always copied whenever it is assigned/passed anywhere. Apart from that, you can use structs in much the same way as you can use objects.<br><br>&gt; In the logic of signals/events/automatic-handler etc of the integrated GUI, at this point adding an internal value could be useful, allowing a 'shorter' programming approach.<br><br>Still not sure what you mean, but if you're referring to something like a 'Object userData' or 'void *context' values that gets passed back to the event handler, I have found there really is no need for this (I did wonder at the outset...). In cases where you DO need to maintain some sort of context for a handler to use, just use a lambda, as this automagically captures any context you may need. It pretty much 'writes' the context object for you...<br><br>&gt; I suppose we can set a returned signal for each 'gadget' like a button or a windows.<br><br>It's up to the gadgets to define the signals they emit, and it's up to the app to 'listen' for signals. Signals are usually object fields, but they could be globals too - they're really just function pointers after all. App.Idle is effectively a global signal (although it's implemented as a field of a global object).<br><br>&gt; So - technically - a signal of 'CLOSE_WINDOW' could be raised both from a closing window (the x button) and a button programmed for this.<br><br>Possible, but I'd do this differently. A CloseWindow signal is likely to be a field of a window object, and while you could theoretically listen for a button press and then invoke this signal on the window, I'd consider it a bit naughty. Only the gadget that owns/created a signal should really be invoking it.<br><br>Instead, if you want multiple signals to cause a 'shared' signal to trigger, you should probably use something like an 'Action'. More on that later...<br><br>&gt; What's the minimal command-line "Hello World"?<br><br>A simple Main() with NO imports should work, as the core monkey module is imported automatically.<br><br>You probably want to #Import "&lt;std.monkey2&gt;" at least to get some minimal functionality, eg:<br><br><pre class=code>
#Import "&lt;std.monkey2&gt;"

Using std  'for List, Stack, filesystem etc...

Function Main()
   Print "Hello World!"
End
</pre><br><br>...which works here. Perhaps mx2cc doesn't like the location of your source file? I've been pretty careful with 'spaces in paths' but that's always hard! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Imports aren't a thing anymore. Instead, we have 'Using', which allows us to use any code from loaded assemblies with the namespace we specify. So, instead of using 'Import' as you did in Monkey 1, you'd use 'Using'.<br><br>Mark has discussed '#Import' a few times now, it's not an actual import feature. It's a workaround for standalone programs. So, you would use '#Import' to add an assembly, and 'Using' to use what's in the assembly. I haven't tested it myself, but I assume anything "#Imported", or otherwise added would be accessible through a global title, like what Monkey 1 has for name resolution.<br><br>In summary: "File2" would not see any code from "MainFile" implicitly. If "File2" were to <i><b>use</b></i> 'mojo2', then I imagine "MainFile" would implicitly use 'mojo2' as well. Not sure on that one. Maybe Mark can clarify if "private and/or public uses" are a thing? Anyway, I think the main point to take away from this is that 'Using' is the new 'Import', it's just more abstract from the  file/module structure.<br><br><b>EDIT: Just saw that Mark answered, still, my post should help.</b> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Maybe good use of namespaces and Using can achieve something similar, but it sounds like what an individual file is able to do is a lot more dependent on the context, which means individual modules are harder to understand without having a deep understanding of the whole project. On big projects, that's not an insignificant thing.<br><br>I guess having an #Import elsewhere in the project making code visible to completely unrelated files sounds like what'd I'd expect and hope for in a scripting language, but for Monkey I really like the separation a stricter language provides. Heck, even if the native code that's generated has open imports like that (I know these dependencies are part of what makes C++ in particular get really complicated), I'd want trans to still enforce and treat imports the way MX1 does.

In monkey1, everything just got pasted into one mega source files so the idea of 'modules' is really kind of bogus - they're really just source files that happen to reside in a special directory that gets searched during 'import'.<br><br>This is what #Import "&lt;blah.monkey2&gt;" is mainly for - to indicate to the compiler that a module/library needs to be linked with. But #Import also auto imports the monkey2 source file that accompanies the library. This makes sense to me otherwise you'd always need 2 imports - one to import the library, one to import the monkey2 code that 'describes' the library.<br><br>So yes, importing a module/library does affect all files in a project, but only to the degree that it adds a single (typically...) 'global' symbol that all files in the project can then access - the top-level namespace that contains everything in the module, eg: 'lib', 'std', 'mojo' etc. It's then up to you whether you want to use 'Using' to get at the module content lazily, or access module content 'strictly' via lib.c.sizeof etc.<br><br>It's a compromise of sorts, but kind of inevitable since we're getting into 'linker' issues here. But IMO it works well and is already 101 times better than monkey1's system which had a ton of problems of its own. In particular, I love being able to just use a plain file path to import a source file instead of the mickey mouse 'relative module path' system in monkey1 that meant you had to be very careful about what you named your source files (and meant you seldom knew the true module path of a file - and couldn't even import source files that were above the root main file). Also, being able to move files around freely without breaking all imports is a massive improvement. Breaking a large file in monkey1 into bits was problematic because it instantly meant each new file suddenly had a new module path.<br><br>Monkey1 also relied a lot on 'imports importing imports' to hide a lot of messy import stuff behind the scenes, so it probably looks cleaner that it really is. But I didn't want to do that this time, ie: just dump everything in mojo into scope because of one 'Import mojo'.<br><br>This is all based a lot on C#'s system - and a to a lesser degree D's - both of which seem to handle big projects fine. The main difference is that neither C# or D support #Import to add libraries to a project - libraries must be specified on the command line. I considered this and will probably support it in addition to #Import, but being able to specify link files/modules 'in source' is very convenient, and of course very useful while developing! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

When do you expect having a more complete release (not finished but more useable, including docs, maybe like the first Max release) around? <br><br>Some more infos could be nice. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
