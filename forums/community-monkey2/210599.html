It's not exactly an original idea, but definitely one I've thought about myself. C# and VB.NET have Roslyn, so it's not like you can't have significantly different high-level languages share a codebase. It's definitely doable, and honestly might be something to put time into at a later date.<br><br>For now, Mark should simply develop the compiler as he usually does, separating the build phase, parsing, and semantics. Technically even Monkey 1's compiler works like this, and could have a different parser attached to it. Although, Monkey 1's compiler has its own problems that make this idea a pain.<br><br>To everyone suggesting a store, I like the donation idea, but from there it should just be developers/vendors making their own decisions about this. The way I see it, Monkey 2 shouldn't be commercial itself, but if Mark wants to sell a module he develops separately, then that's perfectly fine.<br><br>Now, a module manager on the other hand... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

As far as a revenue path why not just keep a core desktop open source and charge for mobile (if feasible as it may not be) and optional modules. That way there is plenty of interest and support plus revenue. I also like the idea of a Monkey store for third party modules, assets and alike where Monkey makes a cut. That would also promote third party development for Monkey and bring revenue.<br><br>Mark also might not be in it for the cash. He might be in it for other reasons like legacy, vision and passion. In that case project supporting revenue is what counts and Patreon, donations and possibly optional modules are what I would think matters.<br><br>Whatever happens we have a great start here and as we go forward I think the language will begin to speak for itself.

The more you work on the topics the more ideas come. :)<br>For example an advanced optimizer using graphs and neural networks to find and <u>learn</u> the optimal/best<br>output sequence for speed, smallest output, or smallest energy use. The neural network connected<br>through internet (in the cloud?).<br><br>Most of the big compiler providers already support multiple frontend languages (VB.NET/C++.NET/C#/F#/XAML,<br>Intel C++/Fortran, (Borland ;) C++ Builder/Delphi). Something for every taste, so to say -<br>because it really widens the customer base if you provide more input/frontend languages.<br><br>I remember a topic within this forum, where somebody said his friends/colleagues are not interested<br>in Monkey because of the "BASIC-like" syntax - they prefer C-like bracketed languages (probably often<br>teached at Universities (Java, C, C++, C#, Go, D?)).<br><br>So, generally, I think it would be a pretty good idea. Just another Frontend (Tokenizer/Lexer and Parser) for a C#-like<br>language, and the rest (Middle-End and Backend) are shared, so libs etc. are compatible and can be used<br>by all frontend languages.<br>It means you could code native, cross-platform games and applications for desktop + mobiles + web easily with the MX2 language,<br>and additionally with a language similiar to the C-language-family (clean C#, instead complicated C++).<br>I guess many C/C++/C# users could be interested in such a thing, if it comes with enough included libs<br>for everything (Sensors, Screen, GUI, Networking, Packers, Memory, 3D engine, Images/Drawing, <a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank"><u>Stripe</u></a>, etc.)<br><br>Of course, this would be a long-term goal on the Roadmap. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I doubt that investing limited resources into more languages attracts more users in the long run (not even arguing about what could be done instead). These things end up with a few or even one dominating language(s). They'll get better support (both from the dev and the users)... , a snowball system, great mass attracts more mass until it hits a tree, collapses (new technology shows up) and things kind of start over again. AI will change the way to program. As long as the ball is rolling, try to make smart decisions. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Multiple languages sharing a core build system and libraries is hardly left-field craziness considering .NET and JVM technologies both offer this as well as the modular compilers. It's hardly a new point that the BASIC-like syntax is a real barrier to adoption either. It was brought up repeatedly in the early days of Monkey when people started to menton the product to other coders. Bringing it up always results in the same "missing the point" reactions arguing against that market preference as if it's a debate to be won about aesthetics or technical equivalence.<br><br>I've been meaning to look at the mx2 code at some point with the primary interest in seeing if the language parser can be easily replaced with a mini-C# front-end. Even a fairly simple mapping of structure and declaration syntax would ease a lot of the friction when hopping between projects for me. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
