I think recognizing and understanding this is what got me the 'star', not so much the particular implementation.<br><br>But the current system has never really bugged me in the past - or, as far as I can tell, any mx1 users. I have never really thought of protected/private as being about 'protecting the programmer from themselves', but about protecting code from accidental/intentional misuse by 3rd parties. So if you're writing a 'one file wonder', it's your file and you should be able to access whatever you want anyway (although I guess in a big enough project, it's fair enough to consider a single author to also be a '3rd party').<br><br>An alternative approach would be something like C#'s 'Internal' which grants 'module level' access to members. This shouldn't be too hard to do, but it is in a way more relaxed than the current system as it grants entire module level access. In 90% of cases, it's kind of overkill IMO. C++'s approach, where you explicitly grant 'friendship' to classes/functions/methods inside a class, is the most flexible/precise but it's kind of long winded and IMO not monkey2-ish.<br><br>Anyway, I'm open to alternative ideas here. But something is needed and the current system, as much as you may dislike it, works. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But that just didn't feel right - I only want List, Map, Stack etc. to be able access to Node._next, Node._prev etc, not just anything in std.<br><br>The problem here is that a module is kind of an arbitrary thing. It's a physical package containing stuff you can #Import, and doesn't represent any logical namespace as far as code is concerned. So making something module-internal makes it available in kind of a fuzzy way. Also, I really like the flexibility of being able to split/merge modules pretty freely knowing you're only affecting what people have to #import, but each time you do this you'd be changing the scope of internal stuff too, which may not be important but still...<br><br>In some cases I can see module internal being useful, eg: if a module is 'in charge' of a DLL, your might want some module-internal stuff for managing the dll.<br><br>Other options I can think of include:<br><br>* Internal could mean 'file access', so things marked 'internal' would work the way things work now, and things marked 'private' would become truly private. This doesn't sound too bad to me, but I don't think it's a complete solution. Being forced to put Node in the same file as List is still a bit nasty so this is just a 'bigger bandaid' really.<br><br>* Use C++ style 'Friend'. This allows for very find grained access, but would be a little more complicated to implement. It can also be a bit of a hassle, and is not very monkey2ish IMO.<br><br>Deadlock!<br><br>I'm gonna keep thinking about this for a while. I think it is in fact the kind of thing that needs to be settled before V1.0 because, if a change is made, it could be a fairly major hassle for users. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

    obj.partnerField = 12        'SUCCEED
    Print( obj.partnerField )     'SUCCEED
End
</pre><br><br>In the above example if TestClass was moved out to a separate file, then the Partner field would by default become private and inaccessible to the Main().  Not sure would be worth all the effort, but would be more clear.  It implies that there is a need to have "Partner" methods and fields, but for that I am not sure? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The problem here is the grouping mechanism.and that it destroys the existence of a truly locked down private access mode.<br><br>The slightly ironic thing is that if I were creating one of these single file libraries with multiple dependent classes that is being put forward as a use case then I want that locked down private even more. I want to be able to revisit the code and know when I look at a private member that it's not being messed about with elsewhere in the file. I don't want to be faced with a large file with any number of classes but no way of knowing where the dependencies might be because everything is de facto public amongst those classes. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You're the one writing the private stuff in the first place, and I'm quite comfortable with allowing you convenient access to your own code.<br><br>&gt;  I can see it causing problems if you jammed a bunch of classes into a file during a coding flurry then later came back to break everything out or do some sort of organizational code cleaning for example.<br><br>The only problem I could imagine arising is if you inadvertently made something private that should be public (and how often would that happen, let alone the initial scenario?). Not a big deal, you just fix it. This is IMO not a good enough reason to add another access control level to the language.<br><br>I guess a similar example would be coders who like to stick 101 classes in one file (I assume there are still some around?). My argument here would simply be 'don't do that', for reasons that have nothing to do with public/private! And I suspect public/private subtleties are gonna be the least of their problems, so again I don't feel any urgent need to change anything for an 'edge' case like this.<br><br>&gt; Just wanted to write some MX2-examples for the most common 23 design patterns, three days ago.<br><br>You're right here - you will need multiple files to do a 'private' example. This kind of sucks I guess, but again it's not enough reason to modify the language.<br><br>&gt; ...so I think it's good in general to discuss those (design) things/issues.<br><br>Definitely! You always manage to raise 'interesting' points...<br><br>But my current thinking is to stick with the current system AND add 'friend' at some point in the future so you can split up tightly coupled classes into multiple files. I think the only real alternative I would consider is to go with 'friend' for all non-class private access - yet I still can't really justify to myself the idea of 'locking out' coders from their own code.<br><br>All in all, the current system works, it makes sense (to me anyway) and neither I nor anyone else appear to have had any problem with it in the past so I'm just inclined to leave it alone.<br><br>Finally, it turns out 'D' does exactly the same thing as mx2. There is no 'friend' or 'internal' etc in 'D' - code in the same file (which is a 'module' in D) can access any private stuff in the same file ala mx2. D was written by a much better coder than me (he's written c++ compilers in the past) and is used by a pretty hardcore OO crowd so at least I know I'm not totally out to lunch on this! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
