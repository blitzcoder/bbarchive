I thought I'd air them just so they can maybe be a helpful discussion.<br><br>What I am not seeing is a clear expression of what this language is *for*.<br><br>Lambdas and the rest are all wonderful, and there are both intellectually stimulating reasons to pursue implementing these features, and some direct applicable problems they can solve.<br><br>But I worry a bit that there's more interest in implementing nifty new language features and less on "what problems can this language solve for people."<br><br>Because of this, I am much happier to see "pixmaps are possible!" or "delegates!" than I am to see some of the other features and ideas. Pixmaps enable a set of features that many of us have missed *for deeply practical reasons* from other Blitz languages. Delegates unlocks better GUI systems.<br><br>But stuff like the loss of HTML5 (massive potential lost distribution channel that is unquestionably the wave of the future for web gaming, even if not yet mature) makes me wonder what the *goals* are. The decision seems to have been taken based on the fact that HTML5 was blocking access to nifty features on the other platforms, which seems to me not to necessarily be a valid objection (put all the nifty features in an optional module? I don't know.).<br><br>Similarly, I think that if we went back through questions like "what are the main reasons why you don't use MonkeyX?" we'd arrive at a somewhat different list of priorities.<br><br>Is there a singular vision statement for "why use Monkey2?" A target product that it intends to nail? A specific razor used for features that keeps cool but not directly applicable features out? Is "crossplatform 2d games" its target, is it "general purpose crossplatform language" or what?<br><br>In short, what is it that Monkey2 is aiming at knocking out of the park? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But maybe the native implementation of new features can be done earlier …<br><br>Here some 2d features that I have really missed in mojo:<br>- texturing for polygons (using texture coordinate arrays)<br>- more complex clipping using shapes (ovals, polygons, …) or image masks<br>- vector graphics (bezier paths and shapes, ...)<br><br>It would be also nice to have a gui-library (one that feels native on linux, too).<br><br>For the marketing it will be most important that people will know about monkey. There should be tutorials on pages like <a href="http://learnxinyminutes.com/." target="_blank">http://learnxinyminutes.com/.</a><br>An other thing that comes to mind is that the installation on linux should be easier. Monkey is open source and runs on linux natively – so if an ubuntu user just needs to type »sudo apt-get install monkey2« there would be lots of new users within a few weeks. Having monkey in the ubuntu software center and other market places on different operating systems would be even better.<br><br>There should be a better code editor, too (at the moment I am using a customized gedit for monkey development). Like others already suggested the monkey2 ide could be based on a free editor like atom (which looks pretty interesting).<br><br>It is a fact that not all of this can be done by one person in a short amount of time – so there could be community competitions, too (even for the ide).<br><br>Some other idea that I had a while back: could it be possible to get a monkey ide and compiler running on android and maybe ios? I don't know if there already are development tools for development ON mobile devices – but if not, this could be something revolutionary … we could write monkey modules while sitting in the train ^^<br><br>Edit: a tool for downloading and installing library-packages (like pip for python) would be awesome! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Or (like myself) programmers who already use Monkey, have used those same/similar features in other languages, and would love to have them in MX2 because we know how we can benefit. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I just want Monkey2 to be successful, and in my experience, knowing what you want is really important. :) Basically, I'm just arguing for user-centered thinking, not to stop talking about lambdas.<br><br>"I just want to make it easier for people to write cool games and apps, primarily for desktop but also for ios and android," is actually a pretty solid statement, as far as I am concerned. It says to me that for any given language feature, the question should be "does it make it easier to write cool games and apps?" That should be the question asked of everything. It means you know who you want to use the language, and you should be working to meet their needs. So, Skid, I wouldn't phrase it as "multithreading and iterators that don't create objects" but as "faster and more efficient." Those two design features are means to the end.<br><br>I think it's also important to be very conscious of the fact that "make it easier to write cool games" absolutely puts you square in the contest with Unity, GameMaker, and a few others. It might be worth thinking about a more precise statement than "easier to make cool games" that differentiates.<br><br>"Make it easier" is also very different from the value proposition offered by Monkey, which was basically "write once across all platforms, you won't need to port ever!" This was a literally unique offering that nobody else had. So there's a reason why existing Monkey users who were here for that reason may not like aspects of the new direction.<br><br>I agree that mojo2 vs Monkey2 is confusing. I submit that is because basically no one uses one without the other. For all intents and purposes, they appear as the same tool to the end user. I would bet that the reason why pixmaps or render to texture keep coming up is *precisely* because "they make it easier to write cool games." :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
