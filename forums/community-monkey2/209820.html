I'd like to see if anybody has anything that could really draw attention to the language from other languages and from game programming point of view.  Obviously, as a language that Mark is producing it will have a graphics library... and hopefully a good collision library built in.  but early on I'm more interested in talking about things that can help facilitate and speed the writing of those type of modules.<br><br>some of these are might totally theoretical and may not be useful at all but I'd like not discussing them means we may lose an opportunity to incorporate something great. <br><br>- direct access to c libraries without having to first build the sometimes complex interfaces like had to be done in bmx.  (this might have been talked about a little already.)  this would speed the development up very quickly.<br>- would it make sense if 2 and 3d vectors were built in?<br>- compiler support for complex numbers helps with robust prediction for collision detection and penetration... does this make sense to build in or is a type sufficient?<br>- what about AI, having a virtual compiler for the language that can included in the executable for scripting?  why use Lua or something when we could just use this language for both? (or make it super easy to include and interface any language like Lua or Prolog).<br>- I still think we need either extension methods or some ability to split class design up into separate files( I guess might be more general than game oriented)<br>- closures.. but it sounds like Mark got these in already(?)<br><br>any ideas?  especially really out of the box ideas? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Having a common interface for most common usages of collections (enumerator generators, count, and Empty boolean method and any other extension method built on top of enumeration, such as ToList or ToArray). And also, similar functionality where it makes sense, such as being Sortable (an interface for comparison methods), etc. Also, if there are very core parts such as Vector2D and Vector3D structures, provide an interface for them too, so people can pluin their own implementations of vectors when mixing libraries such as Box2D or similar into the party. Making an extensible language should come with an extensible framework. I hope dependencies are towards interfaces as much as possible, instead of being towards fixed classes, which would disallow for a higher level of extensibility and integration of thirdparty APIs.<br><br>An example, a common interface for fonts where you expose just a DrawText(text:String, Pos:IVector2D) and a MeasureText:IVector2D(text:String) would be great so people using different font engine's system could be using the built-in mojo-like font system as long as they implement the provided interface, etc. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I imagine that the only reason this wasn't done originally was because they came later and were fiddly when the core containers were designed.  Generic interfaces weren't even allowed until years into Monkey's development, so that would've made incorporation into the base classes impossible, kinda annoying for things like Comparables / Comparators.  Some consistency for container syntax was a thing early on, too, before some of the old methods were depreciated.  Here's a good interface to emulate for all future Monkey containers to implement:  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/92t2ye13%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" target="_blank">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/92t2ye13%28v=vs.110%29.aspx</a><br><br>That being said, I don't know if there's a way to enumerate collections in a way that can translate to no "hidden" overhead when using EachIn syntax as it does currently.  This is a problem, because the current GC can halt the render thread (resulting in an unsmooth experience, very very bad for games running 60fps!) and eventually, it will.  <br><br>I think what I'd want mx2 to have most of all is better multithreading support.  Background workers (for loading screens that don't choke), functions that can Yield values (ie: a way to code multithreaded apps in a way that "appears" procedural to the amateur programmer), and a generational garbage collector, either concurrent or (if possible!) in the background and non-blocking.  Hell, we could even possibly steal the GC <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr" target="_blank">straight from .NET</a>, now that it's MIT-licensed.  That does preclude putting parts of mx2 in the public domain, but MIT is an <i>extremely</i> permissive license, particularly coming from Microsoft.<br><br>We get the above, and we basically make it so all games designed by amateurs are still gonna look silky smooth 99% of the time even if their implementation is kinda poor on the memory management front.  That's kinda a big deal when it comes to making a language package newb-friendly!  We don't want new users to end up having to hit the nuts and bolts of computer programming right out the gate when making their first game, if possible.  If they're able to have a semi-guided end-to-end experience the first time around while still <i>feeling the pulse</i> of "real programming", they will want to dive into the nuts and bolts themselves, and again, mx2 should totally give 'em all the tools they need to do that.  That, in turn, will boost adoption rates on both the gamedev and general-purpose fronts.  This "guided experience" is part of the reason why Unity is so popular.... even without all the extra bells and whistles their IDE and their specific runtime provide, MonoGame itself is taking care of many fine implementation details without hobbyist coders any the wiser. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
