"Blitz" is a great name.  It's short, unambiguous, and indicates "rapid development".  You don't need to call it "Blitz Pro" or "Blitz Max 2015 Professional".  Just call it <b>Blitz</b>.<br><br>A basic 3D command set would be easy to implement and provide a lot of additional functionality.  The key here is to have a well defined scope and ignore requests outside that scope.  I would start with the Blitz3D command set, and then eliminate some features.  If you go down the route of shaders, lighting, post-processing effects, etc. you're going to end up having to build a lot of visual tools to deal with the increased complexity in the art pipeline.  Just stick with simplicity and basic 3D graphics.<br><br>MaxGUI is probably the most valuable thing Blitz offers.  I am curious to see what is planned for this.  Maybe using QT? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

First decide what language features it could support and how they would be translated.
