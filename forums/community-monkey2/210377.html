I saw a lot of forums fail because they started too big (with too many subforums) and no users. Usually a forum doesn't become a big community just like that. In my experience, communities come semi-automatically when the thing it's about (in this case: Monkey2) is good and forces interaction with others. It certainly doesn't help when there are several forums at once, in my case it even drives me off because I'm not keen on following several forums more for just one thing. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I deliberately avoided BB after the bb2d windows beta for a long time until Monkey came out (long story, don't ask!) -- here's what I think.  If BB.com's community is thriving on its own, it doesn't need consolidation.  If it needs consolidation, you should be asking why!  Communities that get old and stagnate sometimes carry a lot of baggage and drama, and sometimes people just don't want to deal with the heavyweights which dominate the discussion in well-established communities.  Shadow hierarchies and all that.  Just my 2 cents.<br><br>regarding danilo's mx2 forums:<br><br>I don't fault danilo for wanting to create a big "catch-all" community, but there's a catch-22 there, too.  Without content, it's worthless.  Of course he'd want us to come in and help fill it with content, as would anyone starting a new community!  But as far as I can see, there is no big draw there at all.  (phpBB is not really worth mentioning imho; these forums are 'adequate' for the existing community size.)  It may be worth going to if it starts hosting stuff like games showcases, reviews of the latest Monkey/mx2 games, community "news" etc.  IE:  Content.  That is something that is actually missing from most Monkey community gatherings;  this forum barely has enough content to keep itself going, and I go here because it is (sadly) still the busiest Monkey forum there is.<br><br>People don't "help" improve the community because there is little in it for them.  I've learned in the past that if you give people the right kind of encouragement and "hype", they will proselytize your product for you.  This is why products like Haxe, Construct2, Fusion, and LOVE2d get the kind of attention it does.  Products like Monkey and Godot get relatively less attention, the way I see it, because I believe their developers are interested in the product they're developing almost to a fault -- Wanting to produce the best thing and hoping it floats to the top by its merits alone is unfortunately not how most things get anywhere;  they usually need an evangelist, a "barker";  someone who pitches it to disinterested people and tells them what's in it for them.  <br><br>There is nothing wrong with this attitude, btw.  Not everyone cares to get all of the fame and attention for making a great product, they just want to make a competent product.  But, what I am trying to say here is that what applies to the popularity of the product itself also applies to any community surrounding that product, as well as meta-products such as 3rd party community portals.  Monkey as a product has a small part of the content (the language, a small site, and some small forums), but none of the marketing and a bit lacking in hype.  Danilo's forum currently as a meta-product has pretty much no content (afaik), and some marketing.  Until it gets some tutorials or reviews or blog hosting or something like that, I'm thinking that most people are gonna give it a pass.<br><br>Sorry for that huge wall of text! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
