The reason Monkey 2 doesn't make sense to me is that its success is irrelevant to me as game programmer; just like C++ which is irrelevant to Unity3D end users because they should work with C# script or JavaScript. For tool developers, Monkey 2 may make sense, and they are those who should help it. Under some conditions I may help Monkey 2. So far, nothing tells me to do so. I might be wrong or Monkey 2 might have brilliant future, for now, this is my position and feel my obligation is fulfilled. I have always been a fan of Blitz products, I still work with Blitx3D and BlitzMax. Monkey X is a great language. I believe Basic language should be the only application programming language; we don't need C or C++ beyond system programming, and I don't think virtual machine base languages are good.

Suppose Unity3D is made of the above 10 products. It does not make sense to me to pay for each then to pay $1500 for The Unity itself. I will wait to see what will be the outcome. However, I would pay for Monkey X if it goes the way I like it. Another example is MS Word. I shouldn't pay for C++ or C#, I should just pay for MS Word. Those who produce software like Word, should pay for C++.<br><br>For sure, after Monkey 2 becomes something different from Monkey X, you won't see me saying anything against it, or most likey you won't see me at all. But, we are still IN Monkey X forum and I an a person who has paid for it. Of course I like to have saying about whete Monkey X should go, and I already said it shouldn't go toward Monkey 2.

Also, notice that not all VM are used to compile bytecode during runtime. Most compilers use a VM to provide ahead of time compilation that produces native output. that's very common on modern compiler design, and this has nothing to do with the languages they compile. Then, some runtime VM run on interpretation, and others are compiled to native code using a JIT (as Orace's Java VM, or regular.NET), others use ITC (install time compilation) like .Net with NGEN, or ART on android, which is again native as traditional C++ or assembler, but allow for even better optimizations, etc...<br><br>Again, one thing is the language design, and another thing is the way the compiler handles it. This goes to the point that some VM for interpreted languages can actually run faster than C code compiled ahead of time (that was shown on a intense calculations example written in OCalm, C++, Java, etc.) OCalm interpreted was a lot faster than compiled code. And OCalm AOT compiled was absurdly fast. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

(not sure C++ fits in this category, but I guess it does as it was C++/CLI).
