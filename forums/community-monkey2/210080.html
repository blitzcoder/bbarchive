Wouldn't take those "general" assumptions you make any further than I could throw them, seeing as the only successful commercial languages I can think of off the top of my head are... ColdFusion, (formerly) Visual Basic and Delphi. The only one of those which didn't build off an existing userbase for a free product (and a language with existing open implementations) was CF.  The vast majority of the languages used today are based off open standards.  So I guess maybe that "as a general thing" doesn't apply to programming languages at all ?  My general impression remains the same as it was when it was first announced:  MX2 aspires to be a language on par in general casual usage with languages like Python, combined with the fine tradition of ROM BASICs of the 80s, where you could build simple tools for yourself and even half-decent games with right out of the box.<br><br>A language which creates its own ecosystem (including jobs) thanks to its widespread usage.  Commercial languages only get this if they have institutional support from other commercial entities which rely on it, commercial entities which have ecosystems of their own.  Obviously this is why the only commercially successful languages tend to be ones used in enterprise or internally by large companies, and why open languages are popular with "everyone", particularly hobbyists and startups. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
