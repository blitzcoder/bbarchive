Atom? VS Code? In the end, there are lots of people contributing to those projects, and it's hard to have a one man effort competing against that.<br><br>It seem much better to leverage those efforts, but still make it easy for the end user by distributing M2 with a default IDE option (maybe two separate downloads, one for people who already have a different ide of their choice). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But I personally don't have the node js or whatever skills required to do this myself right now, eg: I wouldn't know how to add a 'debug tree' or 'auto capitalize' or 'quick help' features to atom or vs code.  I had a quick look when they were first mentioned, but there are a lot of technologies used in those things I'm just not familiar with.<br><br>Also, I've always wanted mx2 to be as self contained as possible, and to just work out of the box on ANY platform that runs a linux-ish OS with minimal fuss. Combined with the fact that I've also always wanted mx2 to have a simple/flexible GUI module, a 'native' IDE just seemed like a sensible thing to do (you're free to disagree here!).<br><br>But I have scaled back my ambitions for the IDE somewhat (for now). I did want to make something that people could write map/world editor etc plugins for (are there any 'game oriented'' IDEs that do this?) but it turns out building something complex-ish with a very much beta dev system is tricky, so I'm keeping the IDE simpler for V1.0.<br><br>I have no doubt people will prefer alternate IDE's, but having a working custom GUI will help here even. For example (until monkey get's 'native c++' debug support anyway) I'll be able to build a debugger 'into' mx2cc if necessary, so you can launch/debug mx2 apps in any IDE. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I can definitely appreciate the simplicity you're going for! Specially if the ide is built like a sort of demo for a gui library that ships with the language itself.<br><br>It's just that it sounds like a lot of work, and I think gameplay related modules (offering features like what you used to get with Blitz 3D, like entities, collision, etc.) should be a priority.<br><br><div class="quote"> are there any 'game oriented'' IDEs that do this? <br></div><br><br><br>I've recently stumbled upon Superpowers, which seems to be more or less what you're asking:<br><a href="http://superpowers-html5.com/index.en.html" target="_blank">http://superpowers-html5.com/index.en.html</a><br><br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/g4iNlEn.png"><br><br><br>I don't really care much for the "server" aspect - although it is really cool for small groups - but I really like how it takes care of the structure of the project for you, treating "scripts", "scenes", "sprites", "tilemaps", etc, all as first class citizens living side by side and editable via double clicking, each with their own editor.<br><br>The code editor seems to be more than sufficient, but I haven't had time to investigate further. In the end, It's a cool mix of coding and GUI oriented design. It also ships with a bunch of javascript libraries for 3D, collisions, physics, etc, but it looks like you can add your own.<br><br>I think they have side projects that use the same platform, but with other languages like Lua (using LÃ–VE 2D), which seems to indicate the ide can be customized for anything.<br><br>I'd LOVE something like this that used Monkey as its main language, and allowed a project to be compiled to C++ in the end!...<br><br>Cheers. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Haven't written a sprite editor since nearly high school.  Would love to write something mmf-like for MX2, even if aseprite is my current tool of choice :)<br><br>having <i>some</i> vertical integration in the toolchain is a great boon, even if not everyone will use every tool or will usually use another tool for the job.  Case in point, Unity's animation editor is there and really convenient for 2d sprite stuff, even though it's baked into the system and arguably a system like Spine or a custom one may be more suited to someone's particular task.  <br><br>I personally think Photoshop is suboptimal for sprite editing, horrible for animation, and well, not the best for casual sketching anymore either with stuff like Clipstudio existing.  One particular type of tool which would be perfect for an IDE plugin would be a sprite packer which takes all of your project resources (as well as affinities for collections of sprites which should be baked into the same texture together) and lumps them together into an atlas set.  FMOD Studio would be another.  As would be DAME, a layout editor like the kind Leo sounds like he wishes were more integrated.  (I think they shouldn't be <i>too</i> integrated into the IDE tbqh;  I really hate the idea of hiding immediate knowledge of the entry point and how the state machine works from the user the way Unity seems to.) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Same for audio files, text files, etc. I'm sure we could build a list of common programs and how they want filenames passed to them.<br><br>Maybe just allow the programmer to add a filetype and select a path for their preferred editor, or editors (eg. for a multiple-choice editor selection).<br><br>I am assuming the path to the asset could be worked out from where it falls within the project... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If it's just a window that we have access to run an editor in a single pane, then is there much point? If however we can do stuff like mapping plugin features to portions of code, then massive HELL YEAH! <br><br>For example if we could ship a mx2 module and have an associated plugin, that would be truly amazing. Imagine all the framework builders out there creating a set of IDE plugins that allow users to shortcut large chunks of game development with visual properties/editors.<br><br>From the experience of coding Objecty, that was a full time thing for over a year. Ever considered getting somone else on your team? I fear that you might not have enough man power to get the job done to the level people might need. Especially when you will have to be maintaining the entire language and platform support as well.<br><br>About nodejs stuff. Really, give yourself a weekend experimenting with it. There are many technologies to learn, but if you start with a "hello world" using "Express" as the main technology... I think you'll find it a bit easier. Monkey could really benefit from some of the methods that nodejs uses. You could easily save yourself a shit storm of development time by adopting it for some of your backend stuff. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
