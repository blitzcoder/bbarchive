I have around 80% of monkey1 language implemented, with a few cool improvements in such as enums, generic functions, function values and namespaces. <br><br>There are several major features missing which I am hoping to get more feedback on after V.01 is released before getting stuck into, including the preprocessor (although I'll probably have to mung something temporary in soon), eachin iterators (for loops are currently 'C style' only, which might stay as an option), whitespace in expressions and more. The compiler is also much stricter than monkey1 (eg: you must have statement separators), although this will probably relaxed over time - esp. if people want 'private method...' to work! But I think it's better to start strict and relax where it's worth it, as opposed to my usual approach of start relaxed and leave it at that...<br><br>There is also no module system in yet, and wont be for V0.1. This is something I really want to think about carefully before attempting. I did have something 'sort of' going, but I wasn't happy with it as, like monkey1, it was too 'source code' oriented. We need a way to package stuff the way c# does with assemblies, or darwin does with bundles etc. There are lots of details to consider here, so it's on the 'later' list.<br><br>But bmx style import is in and can be used to add source files to a project, so you can import "blah.monkey2". This will in fact likely be the standard way to 'pull in' monkey files (you'll probably also be able to specify them on cmd line) when building a project.<br><br>Like bmx, you can also import .c, .cpp etc files, ie: import basically just adds files to a project. I've also pinched the &lt;blah&gt; syntax from C to allow importing stuff in system locations, eg: import "&lt;Cocoa.framework&gt;" will link your app with the cocoa framework, import "&lt;opengl32.a&gt;" will link with libopengl32a etc. You can even import "&lt;stdlib.h&gt;", which will make stblib.h available to all files.<br><br>I'm currently spending most of my time working on this side of things, ie: the build/extern system, and am in the processing of getting SDL2 (a 'game framework' library) up and running. I have chosen SDL2 because it offers a useful set of base features, works everywhere, and is a relatively challenging stress test for the build/extern system. I'm not sure whether SDL2 will be used as the base for future modules like mojo2, but at least it'll be there for people to use for their own stuff if they want.<br><br>Which brings me to a bit of good news - monkey2 WILL target html5 via 'emscripten'!<br><br>There are 2 main factors that have changed my mind on html5 support - the fact that the emscripten tools are so damned good, and the recent announcement of 'wasm' - more info here: <a href="https://brendaneich.com/2015/06/from-asm-js-to-webassembly/" target="_blank">https://brendaneich.com/2015/06/from-asm-js-to-webassembly/</a><br><br>Basically, wasm looks like being the 'abstract byte code that works everywhere' that coders having been dreaming about for decades, and I don't want to miss out!<br><br>It also convinces me that this asm.js stuff has a real future, and that it's not just a passing novelty, something I've been a bit worried about when deciding whether or not to commit to html5/emscripten etc.<br><br>What this does mean, though, is that monkey2 wont have thread features 'in the language'. This is a bit of a shame as I had some pretty interesting ideas for 'async methods' and the like, but I think it's worth the sacrifice. Also, I still plan to provide threading support for targets that support threads, much the way bmx does.<br><br>Anyway, my goal for V0.1 is really just to clean up what's already there (if I were to release now, the forum would just clog up with bug reports!) and get SDL2 working to the point where you can actually do something with it. [edit]sounds like the emscripten/browser guys ARE working on thread support anyway - good news![/edit]<br> <br>How long will this take? Hopefully a week or so - I'll give it a shot anyway! But I do want to wait until I've got something both relatively bug free and relatively useful before releasing. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I love the SDL idea, I *did* tried to get SDL working on Monkey X, but it was too time consuming to me, so I'm gald it's sort of coming for Monkey 2. Just, if you ask me, are you sure you want the &lt; and &gt; identifiers to do even more things than compare elements and define templates? They're already doing 2 separated unrelated things, Are you sure we need to add another one to the party? (I honestly don't like it) I prefer operators to be meaningful at the tokenizing phase instead of being meaningful at a later "semanting" phase, as it makes the language a lot easier to parse and much more context-agnostic, which I think would make the language more solid. That said, if the &lt; and &gt; is being kept inside a literal const, as your post seems to suggest, then I think it would be much better, and I could be very happy with this approach.<br><br>All in all, very exciting good news. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It would be great to have some sort of Function Main() (name it as you wish) for imported modules, to have the same functionality as we have in BlitzMax, but with better organized code. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Now move on to Monkey.. Yeah, you get the idea.<br><br>From a person who actually makes real money from game creation and for others that do so I would say your Patreon donations would be a lot lot more if Monkey 2 was aimed in that direction. There are too many forum users that spout out so loudly about zippy x,y,z features which do absolutely nothing apart from sound good. I guarantee you that those donations will dwindle once the novelty has faded away. Those that make money from a product will keep paying for that product to stay up to date.<br><br>If you think I'm alone in this, set up a separate Patreon page to aim more at game creation / features and see how the donations go.

Awesome.This in my mind is what MX2 needs to accomplish.The language is no longer handcuffed by what is developed locally (here in Monkey land)  and is now is freed with access to a much wider resource base.If you are going to go large scale (say an MMO for eaxample) in your development path access to standardized frameworks is a must. This means some tweaking to Monkey's 'basic' like syntax and structure to accommodate professional coding techniques.<br><br>I think anxiety over straying from a basic root is unnecessary. Monkey X2 is still Monkey only better with perhaps a small learning curve when migrating from BltzMax or the Current version of Monkey X.

I just hope once Monkey2 pops out on the scene, the Patreon giving will follow to a level someone can survive on. :/ <br></div><br><br>This.<br><br>At the moment I have very limited time to do cool stuff like port modules. My projects folder is littered with half starts of wrapping things. With a more robust system in place, it will hopefully reduce the work load and mean more modules can be added without getting bogged down with a shit storm of glue code. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Probably adding more over time...<br><br>Wouldn't it make sense to assemble a list by categories, with specific libs that are required, feature requests, etc.?<br>Graphics, Audio, Input/Output, Sensors, GUI, Database; working with data (XML,JSON), memory, and files , etc.<br><br>Last but not least, the required/included tools, and addon-tools/helpers. What are the specific requirements and expectations here,<br>and what must be included minimum, what could be additional tools?<br>For example an IDE, level editors, GUI designer, full RAD Studio, database designer, whatever...?<br><br>The language features were already discussed at the specific topics. Maybe it would make sense to do the same<br>at separate topics for libraries and tools. Just to discuss and collect the requirements, ideas, feature requests.<br>To get an idea, basically.
