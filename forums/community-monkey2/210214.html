I'll make a more detailed update concerning this soon, but note that you wont be 'forced' to use this GUI when writing monkey apps - you can still just 'Extend Window' and do all rendering and input handling yourself. But I think having a 'game oriented' GUI built into monkey2 is a Very Good Thing for those who don't want to write their own. Yes, Qt support would be nice, but it's a monster of a framework, very hard to install/build, and IMO not useful for games (which are still my priority). Perhaps a bit later down the road when things have settled a bit and more tools are available to deal with the complexity of converting huge frameworks, Qt support will happen.<br><br>I realize this will be an unpopular decision with people who would rather I was working on a 'Jungle2' style mega-IDE, but as I've said before, I feel this is best left to third parties while I concentrate on monkey2 itself. And writing an IDE in monkey2 is certainly forcing me to do that. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Secondly, all it takes is for just one of the frameworks used to become obsolete or poorly maintained and then their entire framework becomes virtually useless. This in the end can cost a developer a fair amount of time and money, if they have used said programmers framework to start with. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But it does frustrate me that huge companies like Microsoft, with massive financial and personnel resources, are adopting the same dependence on external middleware.<br><br>Regarding IDEs: Monkey's TED is a good example of KISS and that's enough for me. However, other people want a Visual Studio IDE equivalent, featuring line numbering, autocomplete, block folding, project framework generation, etc. And it seems the latest IDE fads are git integration, "snippets" and folder-based project management systems. <br><br>I can see a case for most of those features, though they add significant complexity for IDE developers and sometimes even for the end-users. Whether "super" IDEs make us better software developers is up for debate.<br><br>Autocomplete, if not implemented smartly, gets in my way.
