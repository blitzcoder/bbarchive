And I doubt many of us are up to that task ourselves, for various reasons. So it looks like we must wrap an existing 3D engine. <br><br>I looked into this a while ago, and came to the conclusion that three.js was the best solution *for the web*, both technically and architecturally. It was relatively easy to wrap the basics for mx1, but given mx2's C++ -&gt; emscripten -&gt; web direction, I wonder if it's even possible to wrap for mx2, unless we port the entire three.js codebase to c++ first (ha!).<br><br>So, before I embark on a time-sapping, high noise-to-signal Google search, what are the good native C++ 3D engines we could potentially wrap for mx2? Personally I'm only interested in high-end Windows platforms at the moment, but obviously x-platform solutions are ideal. Non-commercial, open source too?<br><br>@skid: I agree in principle but as far as I can tell shadertoy and its ilk are for visual effect demonstration purposes mostly - you'd be in for a "world of hurt" trying to create a full-featured 3D game-engine replacement based around raymarching.
