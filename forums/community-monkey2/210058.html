<table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr ><td class="posthead"><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr ><td >marksibly</td><td align="right"><font class=tiny>(Posted 2015)</font>&nbsp;<a href="#1">[#1]</a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr ><td class="posttext"> Hi all,<br><br>Just a quick update on what I've been working on lately:<br><br>The preprocessor has been moved fully into the parser and should be in a much more usable state now. #rem and #end are back, although I have no real objection to also adding /* and */ or equivalent if there's the demand. I do like #rem and #end though, as they nest properly, allowing you to 'comment out comments' far more easily than you can in c++.<br><br>I'm also considering changing the 'line comment' char, as I think it'd be nice to make apostrophe available for char literals. My preference for line comments would probably be '#', but then that stuffs up the preprocessor. So either the preprocessor symbol needs to change, or the line comment. Suggestions?<br><br>The preprocessor also recognizes the '#rem monkeydoc' tag, and adds the docs to the subsequent decl. I've built this into the parser because it was just so easy to do and pretty much eliminates the need for 'makedocs' (since the 'doc tree' is already there in the form of the type tree). In fact, you can now run mx2cc with a makedocs switch, and it will dump the entire type tree along with docs in JSON format. I also have an embryonic Ted2 (although Ted1 will remain the 'usable' IDE for a while yet) that uses this JSON to product a 'help' tree.<br><br>As far as online docs go, I am still against using an online system for actually editing docs (and every programmer I've talked to about this agrees). But I do think a doc annotation system where people can add comments to the docs online would be very cool.<br><br>This is all part of an ongoing effort to hopefully make things easier for IDE writers. Eventually, the plan is for IDE writers to be able to use mx2cc to generate parse/type info which they can use for auto-completion, jump to definition/uses etc. This has entailed making the compiler far better at handling errors (as opposed to just exiting on the first error ala monkey1) which, from my experience so far, is likely to be an ongoing battle!<br><br>I also whipped a little mx2toc of my own, but it's far from perfect and I think GC-Martijns python app is a better long term solution as it makes use of an existing, full featured C parser. Must learn more python! In the meantime, I've got a large chunk of SDL2 and OpenGL going.<br><br>The modules are really just experimental right now, I'm throwing things in mainly just to see how they *might* look in the long run.<br><br>One thing I'd like some opinions on right now is whether the std modules should use 'fine grained' namespaces or not, eg: should math functions go in plain 'std' or in 'std.math'? C++ throws most of it's std lib stuff in 'std', whereas C#/Java etc have pretty complex 'trees' of namespaces for their standard libs (I think). <br><br>I prefer the c++ way, because I think it actually encourages people to fully qualify stuff since it's much easier to just stick 'std.' in front of everything than std.list, std.math, std.map etc. This is what I do these days myself, whereas I used to stick 'using std' at the top of all my source files. But I also kind of like the structure finer grained namespaces give - it just makes it more of a pain to either fully qualify everything, or add a ton of Using's at the top of code. And of course, however I end up doing it is not how all modules have to do it...<br><br>The build system has been tweaked a bit so it now generates dependancy info for all c++ files, and uses this to minimize the amount of stuff that needs to be rebuilt as much as possible. This started out as a quick hack to make things more bearable, but I've ended up really liking it! It means that you can edit *any* file - even a low level guts file like bbgc.h - and exactly the right files get rebuilt. I only really have to have to delete the build dir (ie: rebuild all) if I change the compiler. There will still be a 'prebuilt' library system in there eventually, but for now the build system is pretty sweet!<br><br>Finally, much work has been done on GC and I even had a stab at adding threads  - which of course, always turns out to be a much bigger and more complex job than it seems! I have a *very* rough threaded GC system going now (although I'm not 100% sure it's quite 'correct' yet) but really need some more complex code to test it with so will be returning to normal coding soon. Still, it feels to good to at least have made a start on threads and to be more aware of what it will entail. There's a pretty good series of articles about the intricacies of low-level thread code here if you're interested...<br><br><a href="http://cbloomrants.blogspot.ca/2012/06/06-12-12-another-threading-post-index.html" target="_blank">http://cbloomrants.blogspot.ca/2012/06/06-12-12-another-threading-post-index.html</a><br><br>...and of course, it'll be Monkey2's job to hide as much of this from users as possible!<br><br>As far as the next release goes, I will probably put something together similar to the last release soon - it'll still be rough as guts, but slightly more interesting/useful than the last release. I am a bit torn about whether to stuck it on github yet though. It is still not usable, and I'm worried that having it there will lead people to think it is in some way 'release ready'. Anyone who downloads/builds it without know the state of things will be in for a shock!<br><br>I guess I could make the github version available to patreon members - you could just send me your github account name and I'll give you access to the (as yet non-existant) private repos. Would anyone be interested in that?<br><br>Bye!<br>Mark <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Using a big hierarchy to organize classes into namespaces can be a problem if they're not put in the right place the first time, but they provide the advantage of being relatively easy to look for with a good IDE, and also easy to find in the documentation without a search tool.  I personally prefer fully-qualifying stuff, too, especially when the namespace operator and the member fetch operator are one and the same (preferably ".").

That's just my personal opinion, however!  Using single quotes for char literals reminds me too much of Perl's garbage mess of quotes and even if the apostrophe weren't already being used for something, seems like a waste of a unique symbol at plane 0,  where no modifier keys are required.  I heard <i>one</i> convincing argument against the current convention, that it unduly troubles QWERTZ (and likely other non-us104 keyboard users) to type "a"[0] due to the square brackets and double quotes.  I'd prefer appropriating a context-specific sigil for this purpose, the way VB does, or using the grave accent character instead (which isn't already in use):  `a`<br><br>I had a check and noticed that BS 4822 has the grave accent on plane 0 in the same place as US-104, so there's no worries there. Grave accents are on plane 1 with QWERTZ, a mere Shift away.  This seems more acceptable a compromise to me to improve the current char literal situation, because 1. it doesn't change the current commenting convention, and 2.  Comments are used <b>way</b> more than char literals are throughout code, or at least they should be. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
