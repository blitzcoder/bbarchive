It, in a sense, abuses OO.  OpenGL seems so much cleaner and easier to use overall?  Does Direct X have a speed advanage?  It is do to the fact that they just marketed Direct X well so when people want to learn how to make games, they see what direct X is all about?  I would think because Direct X only works on windows, it wouldn't take as much work to get up?  I just trying to find why it'll be prefered over OpenGL in game programming.  You guys have any answers? <br><br>Second question, why do you suppose mark used only OpenGL 1.1 instead of using the latest version of OpenGL.  1.3 has some nice functions and 1.5-2.0 has shader coding.  I just got done converting the Constants in glext.h into glext.bmx with a lil converter program.  How do i get the new functions in glext.h to work?<br><br>Thanks for your time. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

With a significant number of lower-end video chipsets--most notably ones from Intel built onto the motherboard--OpenGL drivers are not part of the default install.  In order to get OpenGL drivers, you have to download them yourself.  Some shareware authors have reported that this issue affects approximately 35% of all PCs out there. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Is the OpenGL 1.1 support that comes with Blitzmax to help overcome the driver issue?  <br><br>Hmm..that's too bad, because overall i like openGL better so far.  I was wondering if there any graphical advanages that DirextX has over OpenGL?  Speed for instance?  <br><br>Overall i just want to learn 3D programming concepts since 3d APIs are platform depended in a sense.  (ps2 and GC has their own API for graphics).  I'm sure the fundamentals of 3D are common grounds for 3d API.  Just like D3D has all the same concepts, just different management than OpenGL has.  I've been learning new math and all sorts of interesting things through all this research.  Soon i want to make something to show for it.  I plan on making a game with Dreamcast quality graphics.  I do have a small team of 4(1 programmer..me, 2 artist and a composer), but it's slowly growing. :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Most extensions are standard and not vendor-specific, the ones beginning ARB (OpenGL Architecture Review Board, the body that determines what is standard and what is not). They start off as vendor-specific extensions then are made core. If only one graphics card manufacturer uses a feature then it's a vendor-specific feature whether you use OpenGL or D3D (and you <i>can</i> use vendor specific features with the Windows API).<br><br>An OpenGL graphics card will support all the features of version 1.2 on any operating system, but it may also support some of the additional extensions. Most will support all of the features of v1.5 or v2.0, which includes shaders, but these core features have to be treated as ARB standard extensions under Windows, because Windows only supports v1.2.<br><br>Basically there's very little difference. The only real difference is down to the drivers, as that's what turns the equivalent D3D/OpenGL calls into something you see on the screen. Most consumer 3D graphics cards have drivers optimised for D3D under Windows, because they're mainly used for games and most games use D3D. Commercial 3D graphics cards are traditionally optimised for OpenGL because over 90% of non-games 3D applications use OpenGL even under Windows.<br><br>Depending on the application and the setup either system can yield very different results. Support both and you're laughing. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

My first experience with it was merely trying to create a substitute pixel plotting function that could at least perform somewhere in the region of B+'s WritePixelFast. In OpenGL, I came up with something not particularly elegant, but small and pretty easy. Though it doesn't quite have the speed of WritePixelFast in the majority of test cases I've tried, it still performed reasonably quick and has the added bonus of supporting alpha.<br><br>Trying to create the same quick fix using D3D yielded repeated banging of head off keyboard and little else. Certainly no WPF function substitute. I'd be the first to throw my hands up and say I'm a mere bumbling amateur in the world of 3D programming, and indeed, my focus is on 2D games. All I know is that even I was able to grasp enough OpenGL to get something going, and that D3D is an unwieldily, unfriendly, festering pig that makes me hate kittens.<br><br>I've decided to just forget farting around with D3D and actually get started on some stuff. I regard OGL as the important one anyway, because as was stated formerly by someone, OGL = multiplatform support. D3D = hating kittens.<br><br>Of course this is merely IMHO. FWIW.
