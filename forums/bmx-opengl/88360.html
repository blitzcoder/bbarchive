So, let's say I create a brick for an arcanoid and instead of having to call the DrawImage() in each step I would only have to do something like image=CreateImage(pic, x, y) and then, when killing the brick all I would have to do would be RemoveImage(image). That way we wouldn't have to create a new polygon for each call of DrawImage().<br><br>So... Is something like that possible and would it make the rendering faster? I hope my explanation is understandable :). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In any case, BlitzMax already kills Flash's performance so I don't think there is much to learn from flash for performance.  but there can be a lot to learn with how their engine is presented to the programmer... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It uses all sorts of frame caching, vector algos, and so on.. so its not really similar to how bmax runs/renders. <br><br>The performance of rendering, is a messy thing to try and determine since there are a huge amount of factors involved. But these days,  most rendering is generally 'batch' limited anyway. There is a certain amount of time needed for the CPU to 'setup' the data that needs to be sent to the GPU on the Gfx card. This 'setup' time is the general killer in "how many different pretty things can be shown in a single frame", however, there is of course many different rendering techniques that can mitigate this issue, and depending on your application type, sometimes you can render in quite a different way: one example would be a side scroll shooter, rather than re-rendering the whole screen, you could composite say 3 or so layers (depending on your game) and buffer scroll them to move along the world. It becomes very much up to the technical game architect how this is best implemented.<br><br>Another current method around CPU setup problems is to push rendering systems to the GPU and 'do it yourself' in shaders/CUDA/OpenCL type execution. This has great advantages, but also great disadvantages. On the plus side.. you can do almost whatever you want to do with the amazing rendering power on the GPU's these days (&gt; 1teraflop of processing most often), but this limits your audience since there is alot less people with these cards as you may think :). For example.. over 30% of all PC's have Intel GMA based Gfx systems which are less than ideal for this sort of rendering. :)<br><br>Basically.. there is a tun to learn on the rendering end of the pc (both 3D and 2D).. and theres no simple way to 'improve performance' without specifically looking at the app.. target audience.. target hw.. etc :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
