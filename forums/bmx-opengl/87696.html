In the app I'm working on all the textures are user provided so they can vary wildly (there are some scaling limits I do on them before I make the textures) and there can be HUGE numbers of them provided. So without any way of knowing what the limit of the vram is the user can provide tons of huge images and the system nearly locks up trying to swap them to the graphics card every render. but I don't want to limit it to some arbitrary low number of textures because if they're providing small textures then they can easily handle many many more before the performance chokes. Additionally if they have a 64mb card vs a 1gb card there's a wide range of size/quantity that their system could handle.<br><br>So long and short, is there any way (preferably OS/graphics card manufacturer independent) to get a rough idea of how much vram a system has. Closest I've come is there's a registry query you can do for windows and ATI cards and possibly an nvidia driver function for windows that will look up the reported vram. and I found <a href="http://lists.apple.com/archives/mac-opengl/2001/May/msg00022.html" target="_blank">http://lists.apple.com/archives/mac-opengl/2001/May/msg00022.html</a> this thread that looked promising, but I don't know how to/if it's possible to shoe horn that into blitzmax...<br><br>It's just a number on the hardware, I find it hard to believe you can't just ask for it...

The theory being a card can't support a texture larger than it's total vram so the number will be either the vram size or a fraction of it. Smaller is safer than too much, and the newer the card the more likely it is to allow 1 texture for the full vram. Providing a manual override for someone who knows their system specs properly and that's the best I've managed so far. It's ugly and wrong but it's better than "OpenGL knows all and does all, have faith in the POWA!" that I read everywhere (as for my app I know I'm exceeding the vram if I don't manage it, and that takes the FPS from 120+ to 0.01 in some circumstances...).<br><br>so 32bit<br>maxtexturesize * maxtexturesize * 4<br><br>I can't confirm that all graphics cards won't allow a texture bigger than their vram however if they did it would require CRAZY amounts of memory swapping if anyone ever used it so I seriously doubt they would. It's not accurate at all but atleast it should give a safe number... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I found a function for mac in C that should do it, and in theory a directx query on windows should be able to tell you since dxdiag knows (sort of) how much vram the card has...<br><br>I'm still kinda shocked at how badly they don't want you to know something so important if you have any interest in taking advantage of a card's capacity. It's a critical number if you want to scale the quality of your textures for the hardware capacity or if you (like me) can control how many you have on screen at one time... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

</pre><br><br>in macvram.c vramsize() is taken directly from an apple Q&amp;A document and reformated for C instead of ObjectiveC (I don't know if the blitz compiler will play with objective C and I don't want to find out...). And then MACOS_GetVramSize() is just a wrapper for that to pick out the vram for the display. I don't remember enough about the mac garbage collector to know if this might leak the display array or not. it could also be reformatted into 1 function quite easily... Formatted the function name with the intent of inclusion in the chaos.desktopext mod, as I think (once it's cross platform) that would be a good home for it if they're interested.<br><br>As with any other discussion of vram remember that just because it's there you don't own it or have direct control so use the number with that in mind, it's just a point of reference.<br><br>Anyone know how to query directX for the vram? or ask around in linux? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
