It acts as an interface between you as the programmer and some kind of display hardware. If your computer has hardware graphics acceleration - that uses the graphics card's processor - the OpenGL automatically draws stuff using that, which is a lot faster. Otherwise it figures it all out in `software` and then transfers the end result to the screen.<br><br>OpenGL runs programs of OpenGL commands which draws stuff in a sequence. You can draw as much stuff as you like as many times as you like before ever flipping the screen to see the results. You generally draw to a `backbuffer` and later flip the buffer with a front buffer to see what has been drawn - double buffered to prevent flicker.<br><br>OpenGL can make things rotate and change size and be drawn in many different ways without too much effort from the programmer. You don't have to know all the math involved.<br><br>In BlitzMax, OpenGL is basically a big list of functions that you can call to do each step of the drawing process. BlitzMax has a further set of functions called Max2D which are `higher level` and let you do simple stuff like drawing rectangles, lines, ovals and points. It automatically translates those simple commands into OpenGL programs which the OpenGL driver then executes to draw images on your display. There is currently no official set of higher level commands for doing the full breadth of 3D possibilities - ie a Max3D module doesn't exist yet. Eventually this will let you do various 3D stuff much more simply.<br><br>You can write OpenGL programs directly and mix them in with any other BlitzMax commands. BlitzMax runs the BlitzMax commands and the OpenGL driver runs the OpenGL commands. Since Max3D will be based on OpenGL, anything it does you can also do directly with OpenGL functions. You could, right now, set up 3D scenes, lights, animations, models, terrains, effects, etc by directly writing OpenGL programs. BlitzMax has the full OpenGL 1.2 command set built in so you can use any of the functions available.<br><br>OpenGL is also an industry-standard non-Microsoft rendering library used by a lot of companies and individuals. It takes a lot of the hard work out of making stuff draw. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

And I have a Geforce4 MX graphics card, Pentium4 2.5 Ghz processor and 512 MB Ram. So theretically, it should be running at comfortable FPS speeds. 24FPS at 640x480 is alittle bit of a rubbish score for drawing.<br><br>And the main reason for asking about OpenGL, is there is alot of confusion on what it's for - as there's alot of 3D only examples. Seeming as BMAX uses OpenGL as it's core, then it would be excellent to see more 2D examples / tutorials and information on it included in the reference manuals etc. As the details of what commands do (all round) is not very clear at all.<br><br>Does anyone know if there's any difference in speed to the inbuilt readymade commands like Plot x,y, writepixel, to using direct OpenGL commands? Also BR any chance of the GL extensions to have a unique colour.<br><br>Thanks<br>THUMBZ <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Why? Because the Max2D routines do other processing as part of providing you, the programmer, with a simpler higher-level interface. You can, I'm sure, render a lot more single pixels (plots - which are individual vertexes) using an array of points rather than making lots and lots of calls to Plot. There are also other routines which are faster if you do the OpenGL yourself rather than the Max2D route because you might be able to eliminate steps which you don't need. For example the DrawPixmap function, each time you call it, it might perform a format conversion, as well as an operation to flip the pixmap vertically - all OpenGL commands have an origin in the bottom left corner so the pixmap has to be vertically flipped to render bottom to top correctly. You can cut all that out and just set up and call the OpenGL routine, DrawPixels - to directly draw a pre-flipped pixmap without a format conversion of a flip operation. This makes it much faster. Just one example.<br><br>You can probably get more speed with direct OpenGL but ease-of-use with Max2D, and since it's pretty fast anyway you might not mind the overhead. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
