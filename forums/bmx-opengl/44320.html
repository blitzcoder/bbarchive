As even today lot of older hardware doesn't like GL 1.2 let alone 1.5 which is typical with new hardware.<br><br>I also think a Blitz3D module that used the old DX7 engine would be awesome and the best solution for people wanting to make 3D games for low end win32 systems, only thing is, I'd rather have a proper bmax 3D module first and see a B3D module turn up later on when Bmax has matured a little. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's very difficult to be successful producing games for computers (vid cards) that only power-users have... and then only if they can keep their drivers up to date (the big computer-makers fall by the wayside on drivers almost immediately after each system hits the market - so users need to get "reference drivers", if they can).<br><br>Already, since BMax is going to be using OpenGL for the "official" 3D module, there will be support issues... given the fact that probably only ATI and nVidia care at all whether their cards support OpenGL (correctly) or not.<br><br>I don't know... I'm just throwing out some ideas... ;-)<br><br>I'd eventually like to move to BMax, but frankly, I feel kinda let down by the prospect of how I need to pay $80 for BMax "core", without the nice, tried-and-tested B3D command set, and then have to pay more (???) for the new 3D command set, that will potentially be "way cool", but will be much less compatible with Joe User's system.  I'd hate to see Blitz go the way of DBPro... sweet eye-candy for the power-gamer with the big-wallet 9800 Pro or 6800 GT, but headache for everyone else... :-( <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's the actual DX7 rendering code that would have to be scrapped for a new "B3D module" for BMax.  Since Mark's already writing one from scratch, I hope he's taking time to make his renderer code able to work with the tried-and-tested B3D command set, along with whatever else he has in the works.  The entity system of B3D is powerful, very well thought-out, very nice to program, and "object oriented" (in a GOOD way - not just "for the sake of being OO") too... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

When its out of Early adopters pricing the TSE version will be $300 and recommends a shader 2.0 card in the specs. <br><br>Id pay quite a lot for next gen features but would like to see basic support for older versions of GL that lesser cards can still run.

Dell and the other big boys seem to be content with shaving those pennies off the system prices by sticking the Intel crap in as many  computers as they can (the low-end systems probably sell 4+ times as many units as the mid to high-end systems), so it'll be difficult to avoid that inevitability. ;-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
