I have yet to hear anyone accuse C++ (or any other OOP based language) of “trying to be the little brother who just wants to be SmallTalk”. SmallTalk was the *FIRST* OOP based programming language released more than 30 years ago, and C++ was inspired by it and HEAVILY borrowed many of SmallTalk’s OOP programming techniques.<br><br>So because BM uses structs and classes it is somehow trying to be C or C++ ??? Where’s the common sense in that? ! As I see it,  BM is an advanced evolution of BASIC with many "C/C++-like" features which were included to empower YOU (the BASIC programmer) not to somehow emulate C++. My god, we’re talking about memory structures here, a COMMON form of data management in many different languages. It’s called evolution my friend, not emulation.<br><br>Just remember, English would not be the sophisticated expressive language it is today if it didn’t EVOLVE and borrow and adapt many words from other foreign languages such as French.

And even more so, these are fully CROSS-PLATFORM hooks.  On one particular OS, none of this is difficult.  It can be finicky, yes.  Sometimes you have to hunt down weird bits of knowledge (especially for things like switching to fullscreen mode), but it's all doable.  But you will still only have covered one platform, not three.  Maintaining cross-platform code to do all of these things is messy.<br><br>A secondary advantage is that Blitz is generally easier to mess about with than C and C++.  Maybe not hugely so, but the advantage is still there.  This comes from a lot of little things that have a cumulative effect.  For example, there aren't endless compiler switches to mess with.  You aren't as tempted to unnecessarily compress code to the point of being unreadable.  You don't have to puzzle over obscure declarations as much.<br><br>Now, if your goal is to work directly with existing C code and structures, then I'm not sure what you'll gain with Blitz.  You might be better off using a game library for C++.  Occasionally converting C structures over to Blitz isn't so bad, however. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

BlitzMax modules should present functional interfaces to C/C++ libraries, breaking an API down to a list of functions makes it a lot easier to learn and use and keeps the BlitzMax tradition of you don't need to use OOP to program in BlitzMax.<br><br>2. Writing the glue that presents an API in a functional form is a lot easier to do in C than in BlitzMax. More often than not libraries are published with example C source that demonstrates the operation of the API. By taking these examples and building them into basic C helper functions with the resource management that is often required is usually a simple process. Yes it's a shame it can't be done in .bmx but after accepting that C is often the best tool for the job I've come to realize it's the combination of the two that is BlitzMax's true strength. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Unsigned ints can represent higher +ve numbers than signed ints, but if you really need that extra size, why not just use a 64 bit signed int? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
