I was hoping to see real-time lightnings and shadows like in Crysis.<br>5) I miss a FAQ page.<br>6) Is the source code available (like for TGE)?<br>7) It uses Newton physics, I like that!<br>8) The Videos and Games done with it look very nice, the lightnings and overall graphics quality in the Demos looked very nice too, but I'm not sure how they are done, or what makes them look so good.<br>9) The FPSPlayer script demo was too laggy.

Unfortunately I can't help with most of them. You seem to know more about the engine than me. Your best bet is to mail Leadwerks.<br><br>A coupe of points<br>1) Wouldn't think it really matters to the user. Max has a decent compiler and most of the work is probably done by OGL, so there shouldn't be a significant speed difference.<br>2) True, but it seems that he's working on it like the clappers. Perhaps one to watch for the near future.<br>6) I don't think so. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The network code in RC1 keeps disconnecting all the time.<br><br>And 1) I think there is a big difference if the OpenGL engine is done with native BM gl commands or with a highly tweaked and optimized integrated Entity 3D engine like it was done in Blitz3D. Blitz3D still beats Blitz3D SDK in speed, so I would really like to see how BlitzMax3D ticks. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Real C or just BlitzMax gl-commands?<br>OpenGL commands are neither C nor BlitzMax.  They are function pointers from the OpenGL dll, and are exactly the same regardless of the program that calls them.  Leadwerks Engine is much faster than either Blitz3D or MiniB3D.<br><br>2) The official SDK at version 1.0.0 has still lots of red bullets (not implemented yet)<br>I need to update this.  EAX, skeletal animation, and decoration layers have been added.<br><br>3) I didn't see any mention about an TCP/UDP cubic spline network movement control :) That's what I REALLY miss.

I was hoping to see real-time lightnings and shadows like in Crysis.<br>We are actually working on a lighting system right now using the same method as Crysis and Unreal Engine 3 (there are two of us now).

In fact, the engine script now mirrors BlitzMax code exactly, so you can program in either one.  I have also sped the rendering speed and loading time up by a lot. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I love this!  I'm working on my own rendering engine right now, and I won't be able to live up this in terms of power.  But I think you made a wise choice to avoid basing anything on Blitz graphics, I did, and I've even made my own abstract file system (based mildly on the one you posted in the code archive, actually,) but It uses raw standard C file access.  Using raw low level stuff... ultra fast.  VERY VERY good job.  I'm gonna buy my copy. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
