Actually i'm VERY interested in buying BlitzMax.<br>The main reason is to do OpenGl apps who can run in a variety of systems (cross-platform) without having to rewrite all the non-OpenGL code.<br>However, there is some dark specs in BMX I want to know before buying:<br><br>BlitzMax is supposed to fully implement OpenGL v1.2,<br>ok, BUT, multitexturing was NOT implemented in this version, it was implemented as an ARB extension in v1.21... I can hardly imagine making a game without multi-texturing....<br><br>I have read all the BMX-OpenGL topic and I do know you are using OpenGL commands from versions HIGHER than 1.2 (pixel shaders is only implemented in v2.0!)<br><br>SO, can you please explain me what is going on here?<br>Is OpenGL v2.0 avaible thru BlitzMAX?? (i will be SO happy if it is...)<br><br>You know, v2.0 is not really "necessary", but commands from v1.3 REALLY REALLY ARE!!<br><br>I specially NEED to know if multi-texturing is avaible in order to do some fast/quality work to run multi platform.<br><br>In adittion to that, does someone know how to be aware of what is and don't is hardware accelerated within an OpenGL app with BlitzMAX? in order to choose the fastest way to do stuff, because the user can have a very large variety of graphic hardware who can be very different from mine.<br><br>Thank you very very much.<br><br>ps: multi-texturing= more than 1 texture in a single pass with hardware acceleration. (for those who don't know. But, if you are reading this topic, i suppose you do know this and far more xD)<br><br>BlitzMAX will rule the world! muahahaha xD <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

(even if some of coders don't do opengl at all and are not interested in it)<br><br>Another thing I don't know is how to compile for another system diferent from the one installed.<br>It don't seem to be an option to do that (unless it is not present in the demo).<br>It means you have to compile your bmx code in MacOs X, WinXP and Linux to have your app in the 3 systems bmx support?<br>If it is this way, you'll need a recent Mac, and a PC with WinXP and Linux on it... seems quite complicated to do updates of your app regularly this way, don't you think?<br><br>And a lot of peopple have only 1 machine, not 3 to compile.<br>Ok, you will need to test your app before releasing it in the 3 systems (perhaps more for linux) but this can be done by beta-tester who have the correct machines.<br><br>I know this post won't fix this issue (if it still happen in the non-demo version of bmx), but i'm courious to know what do you (bmx users) thing about that.<br><br>Thanks for reading :-)<br><br>-Edited-<br><br>Ok, I missed the OpenGL tutorials from Nehe present in the help of blitzmax, sorry :-b <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
