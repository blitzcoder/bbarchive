The only 3D module I got now at my disposal appears to be MiniB3D.<br><br>The demos I've seen with it are awesome, so that is surely not my problem. My problem is that it only supports OpenGL.<br><br>I've tried to make a few programs that access OpenGL. In MacOS no problem (as was to be expected), in Windows I never got anything working with OpenGL. Neither in XP nor Vista. Since if I am ever gonna release the project Windows is the biggest "market" (as far as you can speak of a "market" in a Freeware project) this does make me hesitate in using MiniB3D. (I'm only reconsidering it since Max3D is still not released, I don't wanna whine, but how much longer will that take? If it's anytime soon, I don't even need to ask about GL in Windows) <br><br>The reason why I ask it here (and not in the MiniB3D forum), is because this is something that handles mainly on OpenGL.<br><br>I've been on the OpenGL site many many times to see if there's a way to get it to work in Windows, but not one single strand of information came by.<br><br>This may be my last form of research in getting OpenGL to work in Windows. If I still can't get it done (and therefore also not properly document how to get my stuff working in OpenGL), there's nothing more to do for but to forget that MiniB3D even exists.<br><br><br>Oh, if you wanna know what happens when I run my programs using OpenGL. It just crashes as soon as the "Graphics" command is called. Sometimes I see with a little luck the Graphics screen appear, only to crash immediately afterwards. I am absolutely certain it's the call to OpenGL. Since when I use DX it works and on MacOS the same source just works in GL. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
