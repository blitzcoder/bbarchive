It will first look for an unused channel and if all are in use will look to see if the newly called sound's priority overides that of a currently playing sound and will replace it if it will.<br><br>This also detects if sound effects are on or off with the SoundOff variable. If SoundOff is true then it will not assign sounds. If you wish to have a seperate MusicOff variable then I would advise making our MusicOff check before calling the RequestSound function. If MusicOff is True then don't let it call the function.<br><br>You need only to call RequestSound once to play your sound, but multiple calls to it will ignore sounds already played - however if you call the same sound twice with different parameters (volume for example) then it will update the playing sound to change its parameters. In this way you can have sound increase or decrease, change the pitch of a sound, or even continue to hold the priority of a sound. You can also easily have a sound decrease by simply supplying a value in the "silence" parameter.<br><br>Make calls to the UpdateSound() function with every pass thru your program. It will degrade the priority so that new soundcalls will naturally have priority over older ones. This also searches out used channels that have finished playing sounds and turns them off so that future soundrequests can access the unused channels.<br><br>To kill a sound simply call a currently playing sound with the job attribute set to "1". To loop a sound have the job attribute set to "2".<br><br>The sound you send in the RequestSound function should be a previously preloaded sound. Example :<br><br>Global sndMySound=LoadSound"sound\mySound.wav"<br><br>The call would look like :<br><br>RequestSound(sndMySound,100,1,0,-1,0)<br><br>If you have any questions you can contact me thru <a href="http://dewstation.tripod.com" target="_blank">http://dewstation.tripod.com</a> </td></tr><tr ><td class="cell"><pre class="code">Const Channels = 15
