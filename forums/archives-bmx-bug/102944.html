Profit!<br><br>* * * <br><br>in all seriousness, i had some more thoughts weighing up my decision. (please forgive the rambling!)<br><br>so, in testing a simple scene in Unity at the moment, one reason i'm still very fond of the BMax build is there is no question as to which runs the 'smoothest' - i'm really sensitive to choppy / jerky movement having grown up with SNES / Amigas etc, and the thing that has always been true about this language is that it has a wonderfully smooth 60hz when you want it.  in most if not all of the titles i've seen, running on Mac at least, Unity has too much jitter and the odd annoying jerk, perhaps because too much is going on behind the scenes, who knows.<br><br>on the subject of the future of the language in terms of support... i've been able to get FBO's working with both 3D and Max2D, batched sprite meshes, GLSL shaders working etc with the help of the many useful posts here and a the odd friend there (i'm not a great programmer by any stretch), and i guess i feel it's a bit of a shame that Mark moved completely over to Monkey instead of adding these kind of modern features to the language (and perhaps made something along the lines of a more stable MiniB3D, aka the legendary Max3D.)  and improved the IDE to add intellisense etc... it could have been a really great platform for the new wave of indies, who want something with the libraries of Game Maker but without the GUI.<br><br>i understand what Mark wants to do with Monkey, and i completely respect his decision to focus on it, and i get that it would have been next to impossible to support new additions to two languages fully at the same time.  it's just that Monkey wasn't the right fit for my needs, which in this game are as much performance and smoothness as i can get on the three desktop platforms only (and ideally PS4, the port of which i'm sure Mark has time to do! ;)<br><br>one thing that still concerns me, even if we can get a Max update, which would be awesome, is my codebase is reaching the point where draw time was causing spikes and therefore slowdown. what i'm actually rendering is fairly simple, i've already optimised as much as i feel i can at this stage, and that the discrete GPU i'm using is pretty decent, so i feel like i should be able to keep a solid 60fps.  this is where my fear of the now unsupported MiniB3D come in.  it's weighing that and potential future incompatibility issues in Max itself against a switch to the less than perfectly smooth, heavy on the GUI, but very powerful and likely well supported, Unity.<br><br>... ramble over...<br><br> i'd just like to say thanks again for looking into this, skidracer!  and to Mark for making such a great language, i wish it was more widely known and used. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
