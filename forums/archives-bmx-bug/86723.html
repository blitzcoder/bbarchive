In at least the last two versions of BlitzMax (I believe; currently running 1.33), if I do a Find (Ctrl-F) in the IDE and type in something new, about half the time it says it could not find some random integer that seems to have nothing to do with the search string.  Then if I run a Find again and type in the same thing, maybe it works next time or a third time.<br><br>For instance, if I run a Find and type in "Market" (which definitely should be found) and hit enter, I might get "Could not find 264834".  It doesn't seem to matter what is selected or what I am doing.  It just won't work, and then after a few tries, it will.<br><br>This happens on XP (x32), Vista x64, and Windows 7 x64.  I develop on several systems and it happens on all.  I haven't been able to check out any non-MS systems.<br><br>I know it's minor but it's very frustrating for me.

Another thing that happens is sometimes when I try to Find something, I get the results of the last Find I ran, instead of what I just typed in.  It happens at all times when I am working inside the IDE; what I am doing otherwise doesn't seem to affect it.  Sometimes it feels like if I slow down my typing in the Find box, that might help it succeed more often, like maybe I am going too fast for it; but I really can't be sure of that correlation. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So far, I've come to the conclusion that it is a <b>MaxGUI.Win32MaxGUIEx</b> bug as Grisu reported in the Dev Team thread that the exact same source file compiled against <b>MaxGUI.FLTKMaxGUI</b> on Windows doesn't exhibit this behaviour.<br><br><div class="quote"> The translation layer is also a little scary as far as complexity goes.  <br></div><br>Really?  Under the hood it might be a little heavy (mainly so that it is resilient and modular), but I hoped the resulting API and actual usage would be easy-as-pie for MaxGUI coders to pick-up and implement.<br><br>P.S. There have been quite a few commits this evening for MaxGUI and MaxIDE, addressing several bugs and inconsitencies, so you may wanna run another "SVN Update" soonish. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I asked Grisu to post the output of a test-build I sent him which tracked the strings as it propagated through the various functions in the code.  This is what is sooo strange.

The bottom one - somehow the string gets modified between <b>TOpenCode.Invoke()</b> being called and the function being executed:<br><pre class=code>TFindRequester.ShowFind( term$="Project" )

TFindRequester.ShowFind( term$="Project" )

I can also say one other thing: occasionally, instead of returning a random integer, and only if I did another Find at some point before, I actually get the <i>previous</i> Find's results.  For instance if I hit Ctrl-F and look for "blue" and get a result, I might hit Ctrl-F again and look for "yellow", but it acts like I searched for "blue" again and gives me those results once more.  So, it's as if there's a queue list of some sort and sometimes it is grabbing the last one.  Maybe the integer returned sometimes is really just a failure when it incorrectly tries to find the previous Find request info.<br><br>That's about all I can offer further on it.  Happens on both my laptop and desktop, both well-tuned running Win7 x64, and now Bmax 1.38.  My main project source is over 500k, if that matters to you.

I agree also that I haven't seen the random integer thing any longer after upgrading to the latest code.  Now occasionally I get no result at all instead (the Find completes but nothing is highlighted), and I still constantly get old or odd results.  I can also confirm that the same problem occurs when hitting the Find button as opposed to Ctrl-F.  At any rate I'm glad others can reproduce it.  Thanks for the help. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
