From a technical standpoint, the switch is going to hurt us, but it has to happen sooner or later.  Unfortunately other programmers usually have never heard of BlitzMax, they confuse it with DarkBasic, or think it is a scripting language.  Since BRL's focus is  shifting back to 3D development, it seems to me the BlitzMax question has played itself out.  There is no possibility it will ever become a mainstream language based on "word of mouth", i.e. doing nothing.<br><br>There are a couple of easy things BRL could do to change this.<br><br>1.  Offer a free educational license for schools to use BlitzMax in their course curriculum.  Nothing else builds legitimacy like this.  By making your technology a part of computer science education you establish it in the industry and create a generation of programmers who use your product.  And it costs nothing.<br><br>2.  Submit news items to GameDev.net, OpenGL.org, GamaSutra.com, and other programming sites.  It's free advertising and all it requires is an email.  My paper on deferred rendering has been downloaded over 2000 times in a couple of days.<br><br>3.  Place a banner ad on GameDev.net.  It costs something like $300 monthly, but it more than makes that money back in sales.  We would not be able to operate without it.  They'll even perform a free test run to let you see if it increases your sales.<br><a href="http://www.gamedev.net/info/media/" target="_blank">http://www.gamedev.net/info/media/</a><br>advertising@...<br><br>A few technical improvements would go a long ways.  These are the ones that are crucial for us to continue in the future with BlitzMax.  GC with circular references is not crucial.  I don't care that much about docs or overloading.  The IDE is not crucial, since other code editors like BLIDE are available.  I don't even care about modules that much because they can be added to by anyone.  I care about core language features.  These issues are critical:<br><br>1.  Fix the freezing debugger.<br>EDIT:  BLIde handles this well so I don't consider it a problem.<br><br>2.  Have some kind of plan to eventually enable multithreading at some point in the future.  Right now the only thing our engine really needs multithreading for is physics, and it is built into the Newton library, but programming is going to become increasingly parallelized in the future.  I don't care if it doesn't happen for two years, just tell us that we eventually will have multithreading options. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You are working on an engine for which you need to provide an interface for programmers, which ties it into needing to have the programming language be popular. This is not the case for most other developers using BlitzMax who are writing products which do not expose or need the programming language for the user to operate the product. e.g. games and applications which people produce with it. For these purposes it is much less important that BlitzMax be mentioned or even heard of. End users have pretty much no clue how a product was made or with what tools. So suggesting that this is some kind of downfall of BlitzMax itself or mistakes BRL are making is erroneous and exclusive to your own personal product line. Many many people are not going to be affected whatsoever by BlitzMax being a lesser known name. I think your other arguments don't really apply either because given that most end users of BlitzMax-created products have no awareness of what it was written with, it is also not important therefore for them to be a part of a larger population of BlitzMax programmers, or for the language to be more widespread or standard. All of your justifications really only apply to the small niche of software pertaining to creating game engines which have to be programmed or in some other way must be interfaced with a programming language. I would guess that overall is a small percentage of the total products being created with it. I'm sorry that it isn't meeting all of your personal needs but your needs are not shared by the majority. It would be nice if BRL advertised more or made the language more widely recognized but languages are for programmers, not end users. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Try the books by Alex Mortelli and Mark Lutz for starters.<br><br>There is literally no hard- or software platform on this planet that does not have a free Java or Python implementation.<br><br>BlitzMax is nice, but it neither has the marketing (Java) nor the hype (Python) those other giants have. It does not even have the most important feature that you need in education: A proper and exhaustive documentation. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

BRL can just offer it, take it or leave it.  I am not suggesting anything that would require any effort.  Just add a web form for an educator's license application.  The schools aren't going to say "Sorry Mark, your language isn't good enough".  He doesn't even have to approach them or even talk to them.<br><br>We have one here:<br><a href="http://www.leadwerks.com/educatorsapp.htm" target="_blank">http://www.leadwerks.com/educatorsapp.htm</a><br><br>The schools are very receptive to new ideas and approaches.  Our engine is about three weeks old, and it is being used in two universities' curriculum this fall, Blekinge in Sweden and a game program in Atlanta.  I didn't do anything except add that form on my site.  I have not done any advertising at all yet.<br><br>The whole problem schools face is that beginning students get frustrated and drop out of classes if they are using a language that doesn't yield results fast enough.

They will simply say that none of their teachers knows the language or knows it well enough to teach it, and that they don't see a demand for courses about that language. Licensing issues come much further down the list, and more important is the question why they should teach a niche language in the first place. What would be their incentive?<br><br>I also think that there is a big difference between programming languages and 3D engines or any other kind of application software. For example, Graphics Design schools might be very open to new tools, but Computer Science schools definitely are not. Designers love new tools because they might make them more efficient and give them cool new features and a competitive edge. Programmers on the other hand learn Java because that is where the jobs are and corporations hate expensive changes.<br><br>Look how many problems even Microsoft has to push C# and .NET into universities - and they have entire business divisions that do nothing else but evangelize their products. They only have a rather modest success compared to the effort they throw at it, despite the fact that all of their .NET stuff is free as in beer, extremely well documented and even popular among commercial developers.<br><br><div class="quote"> <br>The whole problem schools face is that beginning students get frustrated and drop out of classes if they are using a language that doesn't yield results fast enough. They would love BlitzMax for this reason, if they knew it existed.<br> <br></div><br><br>I think they would love Python even more for the very same reasons: It has an interpreter for an interactive learning experience, it does not add the complexity of data types, it is free, has a huge community, can (and has been) used in games, is available anywhere for any purpose and "comes with batteries included". <br><br>Still, universities use Java instead. Obviously, SUN did an extraordinary great job with evangelizing their platform.<br><br>This is an academic discussion anyway. Like I've mentioned before, it's BRL's business, and it's solely up to them how they run it. And everything indicates that they have completely different ideas about that as many of their customers.<br><br>I've had similar discussions about Xbase++ with my management back at Alaska Software at the turn of the century, and they decided not to listen either. Alaska Software GmbH eventually went bankrupt. The same people then founded a "new company" named Alaska Software AG, which also went bankrupt two years later. Now they have founded yet another Alaska Software incarnation, I think this time it is an american "inc.", and from everything that I see, they still have not learned from their mistakes: Still no marketing and no pushing the product into schools. It's hopeless. At least the company is now small enough that they probably manage to live off the established user base. And it seems that BRL is content with that, too. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

(One cannot seriously think that one can compete with Java/Sun and C# M$ today with a small organisation. It's however possible to be a player on a small niche.)<br><br><br>Because Mark designed BlitzMAX ontop of established open source libraries from the beginning, and made it extensible we can already do lots and lots with BlitzMAX. Simons excellent MiniB3D and Bruceys all database/xml/etc. implementations and wrappers shows how much other people can add to the language externally.<br><br><div class="quote"> Java has taken the place of the main education language a long time ago, and Python is about to establish itself as the first/entry level education language. [...] <br></div><br><br><br>I've written both Java and Python(and ofc. lots of other languages too) professionally.<br><br>I only play around with game programming as a hobby. I'll tell you why I choose BlitzMAX eventhough i know both python well and Java very well, and eventhough I've tried writing small games in both Java and Python before:<br><br>1) Integration - Getting libs/JAR's (and their JNI-attached dlls etc.) running is a pain for me. And to start any "game-ish" you might need to install a whole lot of these whereas BlitzMAX is focused on games so eighter you'll have everything you need builtin or you install 1 or 2 modules and get going fast.<br><br>Don't get me wrong: I understand JARs and JNI well and I've written several JNI solutions myself. Configuring and setting things like this up in my spare time is something i really want to avoid.<br><br>2) Distribution - Both java and python applications are a bit messy to distibute in an easy fashion due to the need to distribute the JVM/Python-engine with the product. And you usually need to write some little launcher of some kind and you need to provide paths to mentioned libs and stuff mentioned in #1 (and do it in a way that does not break existing python/java installations on your customers computer etc).<br><br>With BlitzMAX your minimum installer could be as easy as a selfextracting archive. With a little additional work one can use an installer system from SourceForge to get an nice installer that creates shortcuts on the desktop and that stuff. And no messing with setting up JVM's, CLASSPATH's, paths to DLL's and stuff.<br><br>I do understand how a professional game developing company chooses C++ for .NET etc. for a professinal game ofc, but for small scale (or hobby) development all "corner-cutting" counts :)<br><br>(excuse me for any bad grammar/spelling. I hope you get my points anyway.) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I've monitored CPU usage of quite a few modern games and noticed that lots and lots of games barely use 2 cores and I have yet to see a game that makes both cores work equally and really spread the cpu-load. Most games use much (80-100%) of 1 core and just a little if any (&lt; 5%) on the other core.<br><br>Two cores are however good because other processes (like antivirus etc) can run on the other core when a game is running, but this advantage is the same even in single threaded games.<br><br><div class="quote"> Multithreading isn't new for one. <br></div><br><br>I agree multithreading is important and I'd probably give it prio#1 myself if I was in charge (because some things like networking and "on the fly"-loading of geometry can be written so much better with it imho.)<br><br>What I'm trying to say is that by the looks of system utilization in todays games most are written in the usual (1 cpu) way:<br><br><pre class=code>

I do a search about once a week for our engine, and I have never read anyone complaining about it not being written in CPP.  In fact, most of the CPP programmers I know are endlessly tinkering around with structures and ideas and never producing anything uesful.  It's sort of become like Linux; a few nerds will loudly preach its supposed superiority, but people who need to get work done quietly use something else.<br><br>I also know for a fact that we have prompted a number of people to buy BlitzMax licenses who would not have otherwise.<br><br>But I am not happy about this shift back to a 3D engine.  Obviously I have no interest in it, and to me BlitzMax is a much broader more interesting product, but I guess I am biased.  Unfortunately the development of a new 3D product probably means the end of serious BlitzMax development, and we will never see it go beyond what it is now.  And it is so damn good, I was just hoping for a few more features.  I always thought BRL was just preparing their technology before they started making a push to promote it.  But if we are seeing the height of it right now, and no attempt to inform the public it exists, then we programmers who use it are always going to be considered "off the map".<br><br>It sucks because NVidia has told me they want to support other languages with their SDKs, and Newton 2.0 is going to include a BMX module only because of my work with it.  So I am doing quite a bit, but it's like how much can you stand up for someone who doesn't even stand up for themselves?  I feel stupid going on to other people about how great BlitzMax is, when it seems like the developer can't even be bothered to get out of bed.<br><br>And of course we have seen the extent of BRL's attempt at product promotion.  Back when the idea of BlitzMax first came into light, Mark made it out like it was going to be an end-all be-all combination of OO and BASIC.  He pretty much succeeded in this, but of course Mark has the business sense of an autistic 12-year-old.
