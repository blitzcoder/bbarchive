If I would have found out about B3D/Sprite Candy before I purchased Blitzmax, I would have purchased B3D/Sprite Candy instead.<br><br>My official recommendation is, if you must have mac/linux builds, go with Blitzmax. Any decent coder can whip up a 2d engine fairly quickly using Blitzmax. If you're just looking for Windows builds, B3D/Sprite Candy is the solution I would go for.<br><br>"Finally, does BlitzMax support render targets at all or the stencil buffer?"<br><br>Blitzmax supports anything DirectX 7 or OpenGL is capable of, if you're willing to learn the low level api's and code it yourself. ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I don't need X-platform but prefer Bmax language to B3D.

A few people have tried to add it but it's not easy and never seems to work OK for everybody. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This way I am able to use the more advanced features of Bmax, while still having the 2D sprite effects I want, that is 3D hardware driven.<br><br>Its the best of the two worlds, but if you aren't sure you would want to take on the task of making your own sprite system for Bmax, then there are a couple still available for sale you might want to take a look at, or you might want to go the Blitz3D+SpriteCandy way. Its definately a high quality product.<br><br>I am not sure why you would want to package some of Bmax up to be used with Delpi/C#, and I am not sure why you think that that combo would offer anything better than just sticking with Bmax. If its games in the casual 2D genre, then Bmax is more than capable already, and its crossplatform, so it would allow for taking advantage of the Apple market which according to some people is fairly large in the casual game genre. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
