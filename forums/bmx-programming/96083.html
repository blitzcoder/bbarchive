No because framework is too complex for me (please specify what confused you)<br>4. No, I'm waiting for framework becoming more stable and for more projects released with it.<br>5. Yes, but I'm now just experimenting (please put some lines of code or link to your uploaded program)<br>6.

I don't know why people don't realize  how much potential this frame work has. <br><br>I would love to spend time learning it but I can't at the time. I have my projects that are consuming most of my time and can't afford to just abandon them.  When I get some time  I I will definitely be working on it.  I did do some test but it will require me to spend a bit more time, time that I can't afford to spend to get the hang of it. it's on my todo list just not now.<br><br>I don't know how many registered users actually frequent these forums at the moment but it seems it has dwindled down a bit lately.  I don't see it as a BRL problem but as a general programming forums problem. I have noticed that same pattern applying to several  of the other programming  forums I visit. maybe too many different languages and the programmers are spreading thin. I don't know but it's happening.<br><br>as it stands right now at the moment of writing this, there are 3 users online and 50 guests. I notice that most of the users just visit the general forum's section and you can tell by the number of users posting there. If you pay attention to those users comments quite a few of them are not even using BlitzMax as their programming language of preference. <br><br>From The get go, I knew the lack of intent to use was going to happen or at least demonstrated in comments.  There are a couple of frameWorks that started as commercial and that are now free. I think programmers don't want to try unproven frameworks. Maybe if you make at least one commercial game with it, programmers will actually start to look at it and give it a try. I take as an example Gray Alien's framework and Planiax framework. But I realize that at the conclusion of all of this, this is just my opinion. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I don't use DWLab framework because I don't use blitzmax, I use mainly Monkey (in the past I've used blitzplus and blitz3d).  But it does look good.  <br><br>Generally I don't use entire frameworks but I do use snippets of code I find useful sometimes from these.  I think the reason I haven't used frameworks much in the past is because I generally don't need anything too complicated/in depth and can put together what I need to fairly easily without learning how someone else's code works.  This may change for me in the future though.<br><br>So I guess if I had to pick an option above I'd pick option 1 - I generally use my own code but learn a bit from others from time to time (especially thanks to therevills for java code for Monkey).<br><br>Edit - I wouldn't be too worried about the amount of silence - it seems that there aren't actually that many users who regularly frequent this forum who regularly publish games (there are some of course but they are in the minority I think - most simply use it for a hobby)<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

People have either moved on to other languages or don't need help anymore :P There doesn't seem to be many newbies coming up the ranks. Other languages and their respective forums are still buzzing so I'm not really sure why it's quieter here. Don't be put off though.<br><br>Have you tried hunting around for other Blitz sites and promoting it on those? Maybe promoting some youtube videos?<br><br>Keep cracking on with your framework, making new features, making good tutorials on how to use those features and keep pushing it forwards as you already are. Maybe make a commercial game, or at least a couple of games with complete playable levels to show off those features , they don't have to be AAA, just show off the features and assets, and others will definately take more notice of it.<br><br>Anyway it's a great product and free too!<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
