I kinda gave up on trying to use it to make Blitz exe's because just using the basic stuff was just too fiddly. Even getting it to run was fiddly. It needs a big dose of usability, but I like the idea of it.<br><br>As for Mark, the blitz product IS his own personal baby and it's totally up to him what he wants to do with his time, or where his heart is, or what interests him. Maybe he just doesn't want it to `go bigtime`, maybe he decided that's not the kind of company he wants to run, maybe he decided he doesn't like marketing and advertising and has a different philosophy. Whatever it is, it's his business to run how he chooses regardless of whether we like it or not. I think a lot of people agree there is much more that could be done to market it and make it trendier and more cutting edge and so on, but apparently that's our agenda and not his. So we gotta just accept it because I really haven't seen any change in this area for years now. I think Monkey is a cool step forward in terms of technology and platform support and all that, but the persona of blitz and monkey is `small` and quite reserved, maybe Mark likes it that way.<br><br>One thought that just came to me is that perhaps at some point Mark will open source BlitzMax and then the community will take over and create a `BlitzMax 2` with various improvements and a better website etc.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Open sourcing a project in the hopes that the community will just take over and finish your work is doomed to failure, because it abandons resposibility, leadership and any sense that the project is still alive. Open sourcing something that remains fully supported and actively developed and is open only to take advantage of extra expertise, and give the users more freedom, is a good thing for any project.<br><br>In this case the bigger issue is that with 100% of the packaged modules now permissively-licenced, open-sourcing the compiler too would render BlitzMax effectively freeware. If Mark has unit sales as his primary income (?), this would not be a sensible move (note that most open source projects don't make their money from unit sales, so this isn't a downside for them). Quite why BlitzMax is that way round when Monkey is the exact opposite - the generally considered "right way" round - is beyond me, but... eh, his business.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
