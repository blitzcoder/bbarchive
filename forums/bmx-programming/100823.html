I ran into a curious problem. I code most of my app on Vista 64. I can copy the whole directory onto my Mac OS X Leopard, recompile, and all runs well. Similarly, I can copy the whole Mac directory back to Vista, re-compile, and it works fine.<br><br>Now if I copy my directory from Vista 64 to my XP Sp3 computer, I can compile, but it won't run, getting "null object" errors, and this appears to be any time its loading anything from disk with a stream.<br><br>I thought maybe the xp directory was write protected or something, but its not.<br><br>Now the files were made on either the Vista or the Mac, and can interchange and read with no problem.<br><br>Any thoughts why XP is unable to read the files? I'm quite puzzled by this and any help would be appreciated. Thanks,  -Robert <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If so, It's possible that the files got marked by XP as 'insecure' because of that, which could prevent them from getting opened by programs without specifically allowing them. Try browsing to the folder in Explorer, right-click on a file -&gt; properties. Do you see an 'unlock' checkbox?  Does checking it allow it to work?<br>If so, you could add the name/ip address of the 'source' computer where the files originated in the list of trusted sources in your internet settings to keep them from getting blocked (Control Panel -&gt; Internet Settings) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Vista and XP default to DirectX, not OpenGL.  Make sure you have the latest drivers for your video card, could be you are trying to get a resolution the current driver doesn't support.  Get the driver from the NVidia site, I don't believe the driver that comes with XP supports non 4:3 resolutions natively.  Also make sure your BlitzMAX install is up-to-date.  Possible that you are still using an earlier buggy version on XP?<br><br>Edit: One more thing, put Superstrict at the top of your code.  It might shed some light on the problem. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I discovered that the main problem was I was attempting to use a resolution not supported by my screen. When I put in a proper resolution, all the graphics commands worked fine.<br><br>But the XP curse is not letting me alone! I checked all the files in the directory for any write protect, etc. Things load fine, like wav files, etc.<br><br>What's really mind-boggling is the slew of NULL object errors I'm getting.<br>And its mostly simple variables, not stuff loaded from disk.<br><br>For example, I have one function that defines a couple locals and uses them to generate a bunch of random numbers, like:<br><br>Function MakeRnds()<br>Local gran:Int<br><br>Then in the code (Selected_Tile is Global):<br><br>gran = Rand(1,5)<br>  If gran = 1 Then<br>     Selected_tile = 123<br>  End<br><br>' more......<br>End Function<br><br>So maybe there's 15 of these gran blocks in the function. He gets through maybe 7 of them, then highlights Selected_Tile saying its a null object.<br><br>Sometimes a whole function is highlighted as a null, or clearly defined locals used immediately after their declarations are said to be null.<br><br>I even tried moving my main loop to the bottom, so anything and everything, Globals, Functions, etc., were defined first, and still keep getting these errors. Indeed, the errors are actually different ones if I have no strict, or strict, or superstrict.<br><br>Weirdly, he compiles just fine. Its when it is run that these odd errors occur.<br><br>Now the strangest part is that I'm testing my mapmaker, which is a stripped-down version of the main game, which is like ten time larger with many more functions, declarations, and complexity.<br><br>So why do both my mapmaker and main game, with the EXACT same code compile and run perfectly on my vista 64 and Mac, and bomb out royally on the XP??
