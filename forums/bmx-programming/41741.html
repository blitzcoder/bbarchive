We are both talking about movies. Quicktime is a library that plays movies. So is Media Player. So is Real.

Furthermore, it stands out in that it runs just as well on Windows as it does on its native OS X platform. WMV and Real files play much more slowly on Macs.  So you could also say that WMV and Real are diminishing on Macs just as you claim that Quicktime is diminishing on Windows, a claim which you have cited no evidence to back up.<br><br>Anyways, back to my original idea - the open-source cross-platform MPlayer plays many formats very nicely.

When QuickTime can't play a wmv file, it's because of the codec. Likewise when Mediaplayer can't play a QuickTime file. And likewise when (as I often find) Mediaplayer can't play a wmv file.<br><br>Codecs also determine the quality. If QuickTime is "blockier" it's the codec being used, not the architecture.<br><br>Incidentally, almost all new codecs (e.g. DivX) are based on MPEG4, which in turn is based on QuickTime's architecture. Despite this, many MPEG4 movies won't play back through QuickTime because they use custom codecs.<br><br>QuickTime is the oldest of the video formats (by far -- far older than Real) and still the most full-featured: being a typical Apple architecture, it supported things like localization support, unlimited layers, unlimited soundtracks, etc. in version 1.0, and integrated multiple text tracks in 1.5 (they just defined a new track type).<br><br>Aside from new codecs, the only major things they've added since 1991 is a virtual machine to support interactivity, unicode support, and an embedded Flash engine.<br><br>Ideally it would be nice to have one format you can dependably use without the end-user having to download anything and which works well in a production environment (such as is the case with ogg audio files). I'd like to see this in Max. It would also be nice to have QuickTime support for cases where users will be willing to install QuickTime since you get an enormous amount of functionality through QuickTime (stuff you don't get from ANY other video format).<br><br>E.g. I'd like to use Max as a replacement for Macromedia Director. One thing Director has is great QuickTime support. Using QuickTime I can create a single video of a person explaining something in English, Italian, and French (the correct sound track is automatically selected), and which shows Chinese or Arabic subtitles when played back on a Chinese or Arabic computer. (It can also have an embedded Flash interface, and it can be fully interactive on its own, and embed VR scenes and navigable objects -- but I have no use for these features.) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
