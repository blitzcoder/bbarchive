This installer will ensure that the most up-to-date versions of the OpenAL libraries, including OpenAL32.dll are present in the windows system folder, no matter which Windows version is running.<br>It is possible to just place a copy of OpenAL32.dll and other OpenAL components in the same directory as your application’s main executable.

Creative’s testing teams work hard to make sure that new versions of the OpenAL implementations maintain compatibility with legacy OpenAL titles. This means that if a user has multiple OpenAL games installed, they can all share one set of OpenAL libraries. And installing an OpenAL title featuring the re-distributable should never result in a previously installed game breaking.<br>You can download the re-distributable package from the Creative Labs Developer Relations website (http://developer.creative.com, Games -&gt; Dev Kits and Tools -&gt; OpenAL -&gt; OpenAL Installer for Windows). As its name suggests, you can freely ship this package with your game.
