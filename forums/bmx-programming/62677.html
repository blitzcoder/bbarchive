This concern comes from the stats for downloads of <a href="http://neonavis.com/neonavis/#anchaleth" target="_blank">a freeware app/game</a> written in BlitzMax that I put out a few months ago (which is equally available for all platforms that BlitzMax supports):<br><br>Win DirectX: 524 (65%)<br>Win OpenGL: 142 (18%)<br>Mac OSX: 78 (10%)<br>PC Linux: 61 (8%)<br><br>So, with respect, my experience is that DirectX is more widely used than OpenGL on Windows, PC Linux, and Mac combined, and thus it seems like DX should be the prime focus.  Perhaps others (including Mark) have reasons for different views?  I know that the situation regarding Vista/DX10 is cloudy, but I personally have no plans to replace XP/DX9 within the next year or so, and I expect DX9 to remain the most popular platform for the next year or two (due to MS's questionable decision to bind DX10 to Vista only).<br><br>Discussion and other views about Max3D's focus are welcome. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

As it happened, I had one problem reported during pre-release from a <i>very</i> casual gamer with an outdated machine that the DX version didn't run on. I sent him a GL compile and it ran.  That's the main reason that I went ahead and offered a GL version for Windows.<br><br>I was surprised at how little it was chosen compared to DX.  And, from a few, casual checks, at least part of those downloads of Windows OpenGL versions were done alongside DX downloads at the same time (presumably to see which ran better on the user's system?).  Again, all of this is just a fairly small test, under less-than-statistically-pristine conditions, but I haven't seen any others (in this thread or elsewhere) with figures, so it's all I have to go on.<br><br>Also, thanks to everyone for the helpful replies.  It looks like the situation is indeed murky for the next several months to a year in this whole area (not just Max3D, but Vista/DX10 and the future of OpenGL).  I'm just planning to go with some other, currently existing solution for now (since I don't want to remain 3D-less in BlitxMax during that time), see how Max3D is doing in something like a year, and perhaps switch over to it then.  This may turn out not to be the best approach, but I don't know that there's much certainty in any approach right now.  Perhaps we can all share reports of how different methods work out in the upcoming year or so, which might reveal the best approach(es)? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

What is planned concerning the DX driver ? Will we have to explicitely manage 2 versions of each shader (HLSL + GLSL) if we want to let the user choose between DX and Open GL (I'm not talking about the inner workings of course, but about custom shaders) ?<br><br>I ask that because even though it seemed a bit unnatural, the former plan of exposing shaders via abstract trees had at least the advantage of enabling a complete and transparent compatibility with GLSL, HLSL or whatever. Now that it's dropped - as I understand - the intrisinc compatibility is dropped with it, right? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
