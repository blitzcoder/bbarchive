Make a parent 50% transparent and the children become 50% transparent.  Unless they're already 50% transparent in which case they become 25% transparent!  Parent and unparent sprites and they can retain their global position, rotation, and apperance.  Or they can be moved into parent space using their current offset.  <br><br>Works almost exaclty like the parent child system in Blitz 3D, but more robust.  Did I mention that when you hide that parent and the children are hidden the children remember their own hidden state and will stay hidden when the parent is shown again if they were hidden when the parent was hidden?  <br><br>Rotate a parent, and the children not only rotate with it, but their position changes because they are rendered at their location in parent space.<br><br>This all carries over to the animation system as well.  Animate a parent, and the children move with it.  Alpha animation is also handled in this way, as is scale.<br><br>The animation system has been cleaned up quite a bit as well from the BOB system.  Instead of specifying modes and velocity types, now you just have a single flags parameter. <br>setting flags to MODE_LOOP|MODE_PINGPONG|MODE_SINE on a position animation for example would make the sprite in question play an infinite loop of it moving back and forth in a sine pattern.  Since you can animate the X and Y axis seperately, you can then make the object move across the screen linearly, but up and down in a sine wave, and voila, you have text moving in a sine wave, or some aliens flying across the screen in an attack pattern.<br><br>This system is very feature rich.  It even supports checking collisions between sprites and other sprites as well as between sprites and rects, (useful for checking if the pointer was on a sprite when it clicked) which takes around seven commands to set up iand check in BlitzMax normally.  <br><br>Considering that the original BOB and AniBOB systems were used to create that game for Lego I wrote, and that thos systems were adequate for that, and this system expands greatly upon those, I'm confident this system will meet most of your 2D animation needs.<br><br>See this page for order info:<br><a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/logs/userlog.php?user=963&amp;log=267" target="_blank">http://www.blitzbasic.com/logs/userlog.php?user=963&amp;log=267</a><br><br>There's no demo as of yet, except those basic ones which I posted in the general forum week or two ago.  Look at my BOB system if you want to find out more about what this system can do. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That's 12 hours a day.  Let us also assume they work seven days a week, 365 days a year, because, let's face it, you're a slave driver.<br><br>At that rate, you would have to pay that programmer $145 a day, which is $12 per hour at his rate of work of 12 hours per day.<br><br>It took me four weeks to write this.  Maybe you could do it in less.  But can you do it in less than HALF a day?  I doubt it.  Maybe you could do it in a week if you borrowed the design of the interface rather than figuring out how to make it work nicely yourself, and already knew how to use Blitzmax.  If you were a programming GOD that is.<br><br>So you say $80 is unfair for a commercial license for a library that would take an experienced programmer at least two weeks to do?  HA!<br><br>Ps:<br>I'm really tired of having this discussion every time I release a new system.  It's simply economics.  If I don't charge, I can't afford to write them.  So either I charge, or the libs don't exist for you to license.  And because of economies of scale, I have to charge as much as I do becayse there's not a lot of demand.  I sell mostly shareware licensese, and I sell like two a month.  So... yeah.  I'm not getting rich here.  I'm just charging enough that when you email me and demand support I'll have a reason not to tell you to shove off and to actually help you instead. :-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Figuring out the best way to do all that OOP stuff, and how collisions and linked lists work in Max, and the like.<br><br><br>Deux:<br><div class="quote"> so what are the MAJOR advantages of using your system above Max2D ? Is it just animation ? and the parenting ? <br></div><br><br>The major advantages are:<br><br>1. You create a sprite, and all of the properites of it are stored by the sprite, and they will all be sorted and  rendered in the proper order with a single function call.  This saves you from having to put all these fields and handle all this data yourself in your monster type for example.  You just store a pointer to a sprite instead.<br><br><br>2. The parenting system allows you to do all sorts of neat stuff.  <br><br>You could, if you wanted to for example, use it like the TFormPoint, TFormVector, and TFormNormal commands in Blitz3D.  It will happily let you create a sprite with no image and use it to transform the position of another.  In fact I'll probably be creating some helper functions that do just this that will be part of a future update.<br><br>And of course, it's really convenient to be able to create a menu and have all the buttons and sliders and things be children of that menu and then be able to make the whole thing fly off the screen simply by animating the menu background with a single command, while simultaneously rotating it with another command.<br><br>So that simplifies things a lot and allows some neat stuff to be done easily.  How often have you wanted to do some neat animation and then decided it was too much work to bother implementing, or you just didn't have the luxury of time to do so?  Now you can do more of that stuff because it only takes a couple commands to make it all work.<br><br><br>3. The sprite system provides a consistent interface for all your in game objects.  That makes it easy to implement an animation system or a physics system on top of it.  If you wanted to make your own stuff have this consistency you'd have to have all your graphical objects extend a class which would basically be the same thing as my sprite class.  And you'd have to write all the code yourself to keep them in lists, and sort them each frame, and draw them, and free them...  And you would still not have all the functionality of my animation system on top, or all the parent child stuff which is really useful.<br><br>So basically, even if you don't use this sprite system, if you're going to make your game consistent you're still going to want to implement a system like it in your game.*  <br><br><br>* (Unless you're Michael Reitzenstein and still code things completely procedurally like you did in the days of the 386. :-) ) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you move it along the Y axis, it will move in a direction which is perpendicular to the particular path segment is it on.  If the sprite has a parent, the path will scale and rotate with that parent.  Using the flags to disable the inheritance of certain properties of the parent like position and rotation will disable those for the path as well as the child.<br><br><br>Paths use linear segments, and the sprite's speed along it will be constant even if the lengths of the segments don't match.

One starts immediately, the others go in a queue.  The second one starts after 1 second regardless of whether the first is finished, and the third one starts at 2 seconds regardless of whether the second is finished.  When one triggers, it overrides any older ones basically.  But in this case the trigger times are right when the previous ones end, so you don't have to worry about that.<br><br><br>Now if you do this:<br><br>If Animating(SpriteName, ANIM_FRAME)<br><br>Animating will return true as long as there is a frame animation animating, or sitting in the queue on a delay timer waiting to begin.<br><br>And if you do this:<br><br>If Animating(SpriteName, ANIM_ALL)<br><br>Or this:<br><br>If Animating(SpriteName)<br><br>Then animating will return true so long as there is ANY kind of animation playing.  So if you know the only kind of animation you're playing for a particular sprite is it's frame animation, then you could just do If Animating(SpriteName).  <br><br>But you have the flexibility for example to make a sprite pulsate in brightness in a loop forever, but still check to see if it's frame or position animation is finished, and if that's done you can then halt the pulsating animation.  Or you can simply use the ability to have the sprite automatically delete itself when the frame animation completed, and then your sprite will dissapear when it has done its job.  <br><br>Ie, a score floating up might play a continuous frame animation of sparkling text.  It floats up due to a Y axis animation.  Meanwhile, an X axis animation with MODE_SINE and MODE_LOOP set makes it move back and forth in a sine wave forever, while an alpha animation is also playing to make it fade out.  Then the position animation which is set to delete the sprite when it completes, finishes, and deletes the sprite, stopping the animations for you.<br><br>And how would you set all that up?  Load an anim image, and make four animation function calls, and call the functions to update animation and draw sprites as usual. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I don't know, because I have not looked at it, but I don't see why it would not be, since my system uses standard Max image drawing commands.  The only thing to keep in mind would  be that you might have difficulty with drawing sprites both on top of and beneath said lines simultaneously.  Of course it would be fairly trivial for you to modify the sprite class slightly to handle that I imagine.<br><br>2. There's a function in the programming forum to address that now that.  It's out of the scope of a sprite system to fix that, and hopefully Mark will just add the fix to Max itself. <br><br>3. If by maintain, you mean fix bugs, I still sometimes fix bugs in even my oldeest systems.  But bugs crop up so rarely in my code that it's not a big issue to be concerned with.  I fixed the few bugs that were reported early on already.  If there are more bugs that are reported to me I'll probably fix those too.  I'm using this system in my own game, and the functions it has are ones I need, so of course I want them to work right.  <br><br>If you're aksing how many new features I will add, I don't know.  There's a big update that should be out in 12 hours or so.  After that, I don't know what else I will need to add as I progress on the game I'm working on.  If I need a feature, I'll add it.  If someone requests a feature and I think it is something that is generally useful to people including myself, I will consider adding it.<br><br>4. As I said, I'm willing to consider feature requests.  Whether I implement them or not depends on how useful I think they are, and whether they can be done in a reasonable period of time, and won't make the system unweildly to use.  And if you buy a commercial license I might be more willing to listen to reason. :-)<br><br>5. It should be platform independent.  I did not to my knowledge use any commands that would make it otherwise.  And as I will need to port my own games to multiple platforms, if there is a problem in that area, it'll almost certainly be fixed.  But I don't think there should be any problems.  The system doesn't muck about with DX or OpenGL directly at all.  I'd be more concerned about that glowing lines module. :-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The update is 90% complete, but there's a bit of functionality which is missing that you'll get in a day or two.<br><br>So what's in this update?<br><br>Physics!  <br><br>And not just moving sprites around and inverting their velocities when they collide, but REAL physics!  <br><br>Sprites now have mass, velocity, and elasticity.  When you detect a collision between them, you can call a simple function DoCollision() with just the two sprites involved, and it will recalculate their velocities!<br><br>There's three different functions for applying forces to sprites, and when completed, the system will automatically account for air friction and ground friction, which can also be set per sprite!  These forces can be applied as a constant force, or as an instant impulse.  Also, mass can be ignored when applying a force, which is useful in many circumstances, such as when applying gravity, which pulls down different masses at equal rates.<br><br>One of the force functions for example is ApplyField() which can be used to simulate magnetism, gravity, or explosions, depending on whether or not the force is positive or negatvie, you ignore mass or not, and whether you use the impulse flag to apply all the force instantaneously.  You just specify the source sprite which the force emenated from, and use ApplyField() on all the sprites you want to be affected with the same parameters and voila, instant explosive force pushing everything nearby away at great velocity.  Oh, did I mention this force can falloff with the square of the distance as well? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Why didn't you say it was a BlitzMax sample?  I never looked at any of those. :-)<br><br>Yeah, what that is doing is rotating the shadow sprite before rendering.  It would be trivial for you to add that ability to the sprite system.  All you should need to do is make one field, and then access it in the Draw() function for the sprite to set the image angle.<br><br>But I don't think I'll be implementing it, because it looks wrong.  When the guy is facing east for example, his profile is very thin.  And you see his shadow is very thin too because it's just a copy of him that is rendered.  But that's wrong.  It'd probably be a lot more noticeable if they weren't moving so much or you did it on some other object with a different shape like a car.<br><br>It semi works for little guys and trees, but imagine you had a road sign pointing east.  The shadow you'd get would point towards the west but it would not display the shape of the sign, it would be made using the profile view.<br><br>You might be able to get a better effect if you offset the frame used to render the shadow so that when facing north, with a light pointing west, the outline of the guy facing east is used for the shadow.  But that is too complicated and specialized to program into the system.<br><br>What I would do is what I mentioned in my last post.  Create animated shadow maps that match your objects and assign those to a child sprite which will follow the parent around.  Then all you need to do is each frame set the child's animation frame to be the same as whatever the parent's is, and you can animate the parent however you want and the child will just match it's current state each frame. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

No, paths are 2D.  Could you add a Z parameter to them?  I imagine it wouldn't be too difficult.  Paths are just points connected by line segments.  You'd need to change the code that calculates the length of the segment, and the code that interpolates along a segment so that they take the Z coordinate into account... The only problem is that when I calculate the normals for the segments I store a normal which is perpendicular to the direction of the line segment, and such a direction does not exist in 3D.  In short, it might require finessing the code a bit, but all the path stuff is self contained in a small type, so if you know a little math you should be able to figure it out.<br><br>As for your explosion idea...  Explosions are best done using the new physics stuff, not paths.  Paths are for rolling marbles along, or enemy attack patterns.  They're too much trouble to bother with when making an explosion.  For explosions, use the physics system!  All you have to do is put your debris around a pivot sprite, and then use ApplyField to push all the debris away with high velocity.  Much simpler.  You could alternatively animate position with the animation system which is kind of like a one segment path.<br><br>That said though, 3D is not supported in the physics system either.  But there is hope.  Sprites do have an order parameter, which is effectivly a Z coordinate, and I might be easily persuaded to add an animation type which supports animating order.  Then you would just use the physics system to make the explosion happen, and animate the order with the animation system.  I guess I'd have to update order to take floating point values to do that but that's simple enough.  Not sure why I didn't do that actually.<br><br>The reason I didn't really support 3D in the system is it just adds a whole other level of complexity to things and most people would not make use of it.<br><br>3.

It's not going to change greatly, but I might add things like Blitz 3D's collision "types", ie, giving sprites an ID and allowing the user to specify that different ID's be checked against eachother auotmatically.  Right now you have to manually call the collision function when you decide sprites have collided using any number of methods you could use.  The problem is supporting things like 1D collisions as I am using with objects on a path.  I don't want them to collide in 2D cause it could potentially screw things up.  So it's a question of flexibility.  Also working on additional features like making it easy to move an object back when they are interpenetrating so the physics don't explode.  That's tricky though unless I give you specific collision shapes like Blitz 3D does and make you use those with the automatic collision stuff.<br><br>Anyway, things will solidify as I put them to use in my own game and figure out what works best. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This system took a month full time to write, and does way more than simply animate.  And while yes, basic animation is simple, this system has an extremely powerful animation system.  <br><br>First off you can animate just about every single property of a sprite you'd want to... alpha, color, scale, rotation, position, etc.  <br><br>Second, you can animate them once, or make the animation loop.  Or you can make it ping pong, playing forward then back.  And you can do any of the above in reverse.  You can also make the animation speed up or slow down as it plays using cosine interpolation or the recently added exponential interpolation.  <br><br>Furthermore, you can check to see when a particular object has finished animating a certain property or all properties, so you can trigger a new action.  <br><br>AND you can string animations together by setting a trigger time for the animation to begin at some point in the future. <br><br>Then there's the whole parent-child system, where you can attach one sprite to another, and have that sprite affected by the parent.  Or not.  This is configurable per property.  So you could hide the parent, and have the children hide with it automatically.  Or you could move the parent and have the children move with it.  Or rotate with it.  Or change alpha with it.  These changes are all realtive to the child's current state too, so if a child is 50% transparent, and you set the parent to be 50% transparent then the child will become 25% transparent.  Of course you can disable this per child per property if you wish.  So you could make a child that moves with a parent, but doesn't rotate or scale with the parent.<br><br>There's also a path system, so you can create paths and then move sprites along them simply by animating the sprite's X position.  Or move the sprite in the direction of the path's normal at a particular location by moving it in the Y direction, so you can make a sprite move in a sine wave along a path as well.<br><br>I am using this sprite system to create my own games and I have been adding to it over time and improving upon it and it is quite safe to say that this system will save you months of work.  If I want to make a menu fly onto the screen, with buttons on it, I can do this simply by creating the menu background sprite, creating the button sprites, parenting the buttons to the menu, and then positioning them relative to the menu.  Then it's just a matter of telling the system to animate the position of the menu, and checking in a loop to see when all position animations for the menu have completed.<br><br>This is the code the above involves.  The code contains some stuff from my text system that uses my sprite system.  I'll be giving that away with an update to the sprite system soon.<br><br>This creates the menu:<br><br><pre class=code>

The system provides functions to determine if two sprites have collided but you have to ask it if that is the case each frame and the test is done at that moment.  So no, if you had a universe full of sprites, the system would not be checking collisions for sprites in other sectors, unless you in your own code were causing it to do that.<br><br>And at this time there are no multiple lists of sprites or ability to draw partial lists of sprites.  However, you can hide a parent and have all children hide with it.  From an optimization standpoint I understand this isn't really the same thing though.<br><br>Things internally are more complicated than a lot of people think.  For example, to draw all the sprites each frame, they have to be sorted by order.  Right now the list is sorted each frame.  This (I think) is fast in general because BlitzMax's sorting function works quickly on a list which is already 99% correctly sorted.  <br><br>Now I could insert a sprite in the proper order in the list whenever the order is set.  But how might that affect a later addition to the system like these multiple lists you want?  I don't know.  Also, if I do that, then I have to remember that the order of a sprite changes when you parent it to another sprite.  And when a sprite's parent is parented to another sprite.  So now I have to muck with the parenting code and do a recursive search for children to update them!  Oh dear.  <br><br>And then what happens if I decide to scrap "order" and give sprites a "z" value instead to make things more clear, and then allow you to animate this Z value just as you would the X or the Y?  Now I have to consider that with regards to any optimization of the order stuff as well.  <br><br>And what if I decide to change the system from a list of sprites to a tree where children are literally child nodes of the parents in said tree, so that when you hide a parent the system no longer has to consider any of the children?  That throws another monkey wrench into the sorting, and now I've lost the ability to let you set a flag to show a child when the parent is hidden.<br><br>So as you can see there is a TON of stuff that has to be considered and that is why there are no multiple lists yet, and why there may never be multiple lists.  I don't want you to think I'm just being lazy. :-)<br><br>If someone who's using the system has a suggestion for something like this and they want to go into detail about how they'd set it up then I'm more than willing to listen and to consider how it might affect other aspects and if it is something realistic to implement that won't make everything 100x more complex to manage, but nobody's volunteered to do that yet. :-)<br><br><br>Anyway...  If you wanted to have multiple sectors like that then there's nothing that would prevent you from maintaining your own array of lists of the objects in each sector and then clearing the main sprite list when the player moves from one sector to another and repopulating it with the new sprites.  <br><br>Of course if the player needs to be able to smoothtly transition from one sector to another this makes things more difficult, but really it still comes down to keeping track of where the objects in the universe are, and dynamically creating them around the player as needed.  <br><br>There is after all, anyway, no way for the system to know which sprites it can safely stop animating, so if you have tons of those offscreen sprites animating that is also going to bog the animation system way down cause it has to loop through all those and update them.  (I had someone try to do some kind of complex 10000 part animation all at once shoving the whole thing onto the animation stack and he wondered why it was slowing down.)<br><br>As for memory leaks and superstrict; to my knowledge there are no memory leaks.  (So long as you remember to free your sprites when you are done with them!)  And yes, it does support superstrict. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
