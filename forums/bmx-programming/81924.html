Local x = 180, y = 130		
Local radius = Sqr((400-x)^2 + (300-y)^2)
Local xoffset = 400+(radius*Cos(rot#))

DrawImage myimage ,xoffset,yoffset

</pre><br><br>basicly a better description of what i am trying to do is, the square is an 800,600 image which is  supposed to represent a sort of 3d looking room, the circle represents an object (person/thing/whatever). i have the code to rotate the room with in a certain set of boundries to represent a sort of POV (this part works).<br><br>i'm trying to retain the objects position in the room no matter what the angle is. the above code does retain its position just not in the right spot, even when the rot# = 0 its position isn't x,y its shifted right and down more or less off centre to the right and down, but like i said it does retain its proper position with the rotation just around the wrong x,y values.<br><br>every thing else i have tried including both your codes word for word just with my own values just won't work for me.<br><br>so i don't know i'm at a loss.<br><br>again thanks for the help though, and i'll continue to plug a way at it for a bit but in the long run what i'm trying to accomplish might be mildly amusing at best but i don't know if it would add all that much value to that part of the game or not or if it's even worth the frustration. hopefully i'll get it worked out though. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
