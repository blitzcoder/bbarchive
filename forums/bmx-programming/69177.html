You can search per forum, per product or all forums for all products.

Starting a new post might take a few days to get a full picture and differing views. <br>3) Finding other posts on the same subject allows you to reference them if you still need to post.

They wait until the time is right to mention what they are getting ready to release. <br><br>I also don't think that learning a technology that you may replace later a waste of time.  At the worst case scenario, you learned that technology and decided to move on to another one. You picked up tid bits that could possibly transpire to the next technology, or even to something else you can use later.<br><br>Seriously, programmers are MEANT to learn and explore technologies. They are by default trying to implement the technology that suites their particular app need. I go through many different technologies in a year. Why? because each one offers something the other doesn't. Eventually I decide which best fits the need. Is it a waste of time? NO. I spent time evaluating what I need to move forward with to solve the need for the project.<br><br>Unfortunately, people purchase a technology and think it should be their "end-all" technology. In reality, it may only solve 60% of their needs. I understand the need for software continuity, and even the need for something stable. We all want this going into an investment with our purchases and time. I've even gone through MANY 3D APIs, but the end decision is always the same. Does it offer what the project needs?<br><br>If it answers yes, then that's the API for the project. Who cares that you review and sink time into making that decision? You might personally, because you (using it loosley, not directly towards anyone) look at it as the time it took to do something. I look at it as an investment like FlameDuck stated. If you spend 6 months learning an API and then later decide to move onto another API, fine. You learned it and moved on. Otherwise, you spent 6 months learning the API you decided to use, and can continue progress with it. HOW IS THAT A LOSS? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Max3D for instance (which I, personally don't care if it comes to fruition or not) has been a very HOT issue over the past couple years since BlitzMax debuted. Sure. It would be nice I guess, but at the same time, there are several other APIs that do the same stuff. I don't recall ever being promised it would be here. And when or if it does, I am NOT entitled freely to it. Same with MaxGUI. People eagerly awaited it. BRL stated it was being worked on. Time passed and eventually it showed up. Maybe Max3D will, maybe not. I realistically wouldn't worry over it either way. NOTE: I am describing my own personal feelings. Yours are free to be different.<br><br>My point is the BlitzMax was designed for the user community to extend it in ANYWAY they feel beneficial to their needs. That alone attracted me. Each of us have our own reasons for coming to this language to use it however we intend. The fact is you can make what ever you need. If you do not feel like it, then either wait it out and see if BRL will or some 3rd party does. TrueVision3D is capable of being utilized in Max. Granted, it's Windows only. OK. So you say you need it cross platty. GREAT! Don't use TV3D. Look for another. miniB3D is one that can. Don't like it? Fine. There's another option out there. Look and you'll find it. Ask a few questions on the forum if you need to know more of where.<br><br>FlameDuck also provided another great point: OpenGL. Its readily available. BlitzMax actually HAD 3D capabilities builtin the entire time! It's right there. You gotta learn OpenGL, but them the breaks. So... You don't have time to learn OpenGL? Well, the option then becomes... Do I stay with one of the other options until a better one comes, or should I spend a few bucks on another language which provides 3D? <br><br>I'm not intending on any sort of sarcasim should you have read that from this. <br><br>It would be nice if certain things came with the product at the time we purchased it or shortly thereafter. The real fact is its not up to us. When we purchased the product, we knew these limitations (at least I realized it). The demos are there to provide insight to the product. You take a gander at it then and if you like and accept what you see, you decide to purchase or not.<br><br>If the company decides NOT to include something or do include something, thats up to them. We can complain, and MAYBE they'll do different later. In the end, they only owe us what we paid for.<br><br>I agree I would LOVE to have a manual. Need a tutorial? <a href="/posts.php?topic=42519" target="_blank">Wave</a> (if memory serves me) wrote a tutorial on BlitzMax... There's also the one <a href="http://www.sloankelly.net" target="_blank"> Sloan Kelly </a> wrote "Games Programming for the Absolute Beginner".

It has way more involved when you build a 3D engine for even a single platform. Multiply that by 3 and ensuring each OS will respond in a similar fashion with the same commands. No easy task. A "good" 3D engine takes years with a full team full time on deck. mark is pretty much solo from my understanding. <br><br>You re-iterated my points. :)<br><br>I am perfectly happy with Max as it exists today. 2D is fun for me to mess around with. I also appreciate the needs others may have in wanting a 3D module officially released by BRL.  I've even sunk my teeth into DX D3D. No easy feat that is. OpenGL seems more attractive IMHO. But just dealing with those APIs make you better understand and appreciate the work authors of any 3D engine provide. 2D is also included, even as "simple" as it appears. <br><br>Again, you also lean towards the idea I posed earlier about programmers being creative and wanting to test out new technologies. You CAN do what you need with what exists currently in BlitzMax. Its a matter of do you want to proceed or not? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Maybe Flow will also be an option but in my situation i just don't feel this much after buying a 3D package for Max beside of the official one. And if i got it right and they rewrite the editor than i somehow don't see them working on 3D a lot at the moment.<br><br>I suspect that a) it takes them a serious amount of time to come up with a proper and smooth 3D solution which also could be partly intention due to DX10 or they b) rethought their strategy and now want to build on an existing 3D engine as well and integrate such an engine as good as possible. But maybe 3D is even on a lower priority because they fully concentrate on providing a better 2D package (reworking BlitzMax, ARM support, Physics for 2D?, ...).<br><br>But it was already clear in summer/autumn last year (can't remember exactly) that we won't see a 3D engine from BRL soon as Mark wasn't even sure about which SM he want's to support so ...<br><br>My guess is that depending on the route they'll follow, a lot of months will pass until you'll see something. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Again, just pointing out stuff, not an arguement of these. <br><br>The community takes the second seat, and is able to launch the language by using it, helping others out by any means possible, and releasing their own products which show off the capabilites to others whom potentially want to write apps with it.<br><br>I also agree with you on the cross platform capability for an engine in Max.

Maybe I missed it from not looking close enough, does this mini-3d work on Mac aswell as PC?  Why am I asking... By asking i've just breached user forum rule #1 ... there must already be an answer somewhere on this forum.<br><br>The thing is there are a lot of forums on the internet, and all the forums with 3 or more people have users who say "why cant you use the search feature?"<br><br>My asnwer is, "because it's human nature - and you could have found that out if only you'd used the search feature".<br><br>So my question: Does this mini3D work on all platforms? Or is it Win only?<br><br>I have to say as a Mac user i've found support for Blitz Max frustrating, it's one of the reasons I dont come here much.  I do also use it for the PC though - but I dont get stuck as often as I do with a Mac.<br><br>I'd also like an IDE that doesnt change tabs when I ctrl-left or ctrl-right.  Again I could use the search feature, but then I also get a gazillion other posts for B+ and B3D too, or I might, in any case it's not in my nature.<br><br>Actually that's a lie, I do use the search here quite a lot as that is easier than posting, but i'm building to something here.<br><br>There's a lot of great modules, but unless you are plugged into the community there is no way of knowing where to find them.<br><br>It's not my fault I dont know what to search for, i'm not here enough to know what words to search on.<br><br>Is there a place that lets you look through completed expansions, like IDE's and 3D modules?<br><br>Why am I asking... I should just search. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
