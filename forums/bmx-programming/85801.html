I would agree that reading Int's is pretty much the fastest. For me, also writing Doubles is faster than writing 2 Int's, but Int's are always by far the fastest to read, and definitely it's beneficial to read a whole int and break it up with a few commands, especially when your code is small enough that it'll be in a cache.<br><br>One thing I thought you were doing wrong, is that when you go Byte Ptr=Array, I don't know if that's really valid. An array is actually an object, a `type`, which has within it a Field where the memory address of the array data is kept. So the pointer to the array itself, is a pointer to an array object, not the contents of the field within the array type.<br><br>I would more typically do:<br><br>MyBytePtr:Byte Ptr=VarPtr(MyArray[0])<br><br>Which will ensure that you are pointing to the location in memory of the first element of the array.<br><br>Maybe you can actually just do BytePtr=Array but to me I would think that would start writing to memory based on the location of the type, not the array's actual storage space.<br><br>To speed it up, unroll your loops a bit. Do at least 4 pixels at a time in a loop - this will reduce your loop overhead. Also consider pipelining multiple memory accesses. If you read from memory and then your very next instruction uses the value which was read, this creates what's called a pipeline stall - the second command can't run until the memory has been read. I'd recommend getting ahead of yourself on the reads, like start by reading two memory locations, then start processing the first location, then when you're ready to process the second one read the third one first. This might help the cpu to be able to do some operations while it's waiting for memory accesses to finish.<br><br>I also see that you are using lots of Globals, which forces variables to be stored in memory and not CPU registers. You should use as many Local variables as possible, and you should make sure they are declared outside of any loops so that the memory management won't have to keep re-allocating them.<br><br>Also when you're &amp;'ing 255 with stuff, I think that forces it to store the 255 as immediate values in the instruction opcodes, or in memory, so I would recommend you put your `mask` into a local variable, like Local ByteMask:Int=$FF, once outside all loops, then use that in your and'ing.<br><br>Since you're reading RGB values I presume you're actualy using ARGB format and are skipping the A? Cus that's what your code is doing.<br><br>You might also try putting the values 8 and 16 into Locals and then shift with them - not sure if that works out better or not, but my guess is that each time you define a constant value it has to store it somewhere separately each time and access that location each time, so if you put it into a single local it presumably won't have to read as much memory, or could be in a single register.<br><br>If you do several unrolled loops, you could also do like =P[0] =P[1] =P[2] =P[3] etc rather than extra adds to P. Since you're giving an offset anyway, you might as well use that to increment the position then just do P:+4 at the end, for example.<br><br>Okay, so you made me do it...<br><pre class=code>

</textarea><br><br><br>So it turns out that unrolling the loop 4x results in a 4x speedup.  But unrolling it 16x resulted in a 24x speedup possibly due to some instruction alignment occuring.  <br><br>And for the heck of it, I tried unrolling it 32x.  That resulted in a 48x speedup.<br><br>The only way any of this makes sense I guess is if the instructions in the loop are insanely fast, and the jump instructions are insanely slow.  Because it seems to me that unrolling even 64 or 128 times could possibly be worth it.<br><br>Doesn't make for very nice code though.  <br><br>BlitzMax doesn't have some way to inline or define a block of code which would make this any cleaner, does it?<br><br>As for how to handle images which don't have a size which is divisible by whatever the unwrapping is, I guess you can just put a normal loop at the beginning or end to handle the extra.  Since that will only be a few bytes it won't impact the speed. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Removing more of the loop overhead also removes more `branch prediction` misses in the cpu, perhaps.<br><br>I don't know if putting constants into locals is any faster, it might not be, might even be slower, you'll have to speed-test that. Seems you did that for bytes, anyway.<br><br>It's such a tight loop to be calling it thousands/millions of times for images, that I really think it's worth doing the unrolling thing. One thing I suggest is to make a large loop which does, say, 32, 64, or even 256 iterations unrolled. Do that as many times as you can within the memory limits. Then finish off the final last few bytes that aren't aligned to those numbers in a separate regular loop. The `leftovers` will have neglible unnoticeable effect on speed overall.<br><br>Interesting about the pipelining having no apparent effect. I've seen it have an effect on my iMac on a number of occasions, but usually perhaps it's when you're doing a bit more math/manipulation inbetween memory reads. Dont' forget you are only reading/writing data right now, when you add in any kind of `processing` to the pixel values that'll decrease the speed. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
