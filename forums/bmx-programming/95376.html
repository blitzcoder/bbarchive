On the PC side of things, I have XP and Vista installed on my own PC, and access to a Windows 7 machine for testing on that OS as well.<br><br>It also does not appear so critical which version of Windows is used to develop on.  In fact, it would appear that it's better to develop on Vista/Win7 (the latest OSes) than on XP, because these versions of Windows force you to do things 'properly', which will work under XP without any issues (that we've seen so far).<br><br>With Macs though, there aren't so many Mac owning friends around, if any, and I would imagine that most of us only purchased a Mac to produce their game for this market as well.  As Macs are not cheap, chances are we only have the one and do not have access to another one nor the funds to purchase another one.  So it looks like every time a new version of OS X comes out we'll need to create a new partition for it.<br><br>I'm sure this is all common sense really, but this is the first that some of us have seen it mentioned that we need to be using the earliest OS for a release build.  Just feel it should have been made clearer somewhere before most of us overwrote our Tiger installations. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I had an issue caused by some third party (and non-BRL!) code which meant my game (Magicville) worked perfectly well on an English OS, but it fell flat on its face on anything else.  I hadn't tested for that, neither had BFG.  The upshot was that I lost a LOT of sales in the critical first few days when sales are at their peak.

Looks like a Universal Binary is still the way to go for the moment.<br><br>Which brings me to my next question.  My Intel Mac currently has Snow Leopard installed, so if I compile for Intel on that, and assuming that this will work on Tiger, can I then create a Universal Binary with the PPC version built in Tiger?  What we end up with is a Universal Binary with one binary compiled in SL and the other in Tiger.  I could test for this, but my PPC Mac is elsewhere at the moment.  A situation I could remedy tomorrow and test.<br><br>I'm beginning to think I should re-install my Intel Mac with Tiger, and then triple boot it with Snow Leopard and Lion just to be sure. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
