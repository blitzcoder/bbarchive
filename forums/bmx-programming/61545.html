I am not sure where to put this, I thought this would be the best area.<br><br>I have a program written in VB.net that is functional, but one of the main portions uses the GDI and it is SLLLOOOOWWWW.  I am an intermediate Max programmer and can handle most of the program, but I need someone to write a portion for me.<br><br>In a nutshell, here is what I need:<br><br>The user scans a bed of images from a scanner to a window.  They can then crop and the image can be rotated and gamma corrected.  Then the image is saved as an 800x600 jpg.  They can scan up to 50 images and these are displayed as thumbnails on the same screen.  The order of these thumbnails can be changed by dragging and dropping.  There is a free TWAIN dll that should be very easy to wrap for what we need.  The software is run on a dedicated computer, so no oddball hardware configs.<br><br>I can show interested parties the existing software.  We can then move onto price from there.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Why0Why <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I mean, have a function that receives the image in it's original size, and using the render image of the GDI+, returns a small snapshot (a new image with a small size). This way, you don't need to have all big images loaded at the same time.

You will only ever have about 8-10 thumbnails onscreen. And if you make sure you generate the smaller Thumbnail from the Original Image, you can make sure it is a fair sight Smaller in terms of memory requirements than simply drawing the original 800x600 with scaling. DrawScaledImage is bloody slow in any language, compared to non-scaled drawing.<br><br>This is also easily done in C#.<br><br>If this doesnt work for you, I recommend using GDI+ and create a custom Thumbnail control. Using 50 picture Boxes is definatly not the way to go. Just create 1 Large Image in 1 PictureBox and create some 'CopyImageRect' functionality to copy the thumbnail to the large image.<br><br>I did this for a small puzzle game in C# 2.0 and it worked brilliantly. It renders up to 100 seperate images this way and does it more than fast enough for Realtime rendering.<br><br>The code I used is pure managed GDI, but if you dont mind getting your hands dirty with Native Windows stuff, you can make this even faster by using BitBlt and a host of other native windows Drawing routines. The thing you will be doing here is very similar to drawing a 2D Tilemap. Keep that in the back of your mind when you write it and it'll work out just fine. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The application does need to have all 50 viewed at the same time.  The order can be changed, and they all need to be visible so they can be dropped in the right spot.  The software currently save the image to the hard disk as an 800x600 jpg(very low res, only 50K or so) and then loads it as a thumbnail.  So these are not all in memory.  The only thing that stays in memory is a hi res scan of the bed so that the images can be cropped without having to go back to the scanner bed every time(there might be 5 separate photos that are scanned in at the same time, this saves tons of time when scanning lots of images.)  <br><br>The problem is, even when the pictureboxes are empty, it takes forever for the screen to redraw(for example, when the screen is first displayed.)  A listbox would work, but it looks so horrible, I won't use it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If I remember correctly there are 32bpp and 16bpp image types in .net<br><br>So if you are loading them into a 32bpp format (most likely, I believe it is the default) each pixel will take 4 bytes, no matter what the size of the file you originally loaded it from.

The actual Dragging code is a breeze.<br><br>- User presses mouse on a Thumbnail<br>- Store the Thumb ID or X/y position within the large image as the Dragging Start-point.<br>- Then as long as the mouse is pressed you can draw a seperate small image that moves with the mousecursor, preferable a semi-transparent version of the selected thumbnail, or simply an outline rectangle the size of your thumbnail.
