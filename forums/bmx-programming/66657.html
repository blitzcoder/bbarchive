Much like MaxGUI, this is probably a good thing as most people wouldn't use the advanced features and the development cost would therefore be poor value for BRL.<br><br>FMod is too expensive. I'm pretty sure that I won't qualify for a shareware license and people who have tried to negotiate with them tell me that they don't negotiate.<br><br>Bass is similar to FMod, although with perhap a little more possiblity of negotiation, though again I feel it's unlikely I'd get away without paying for a commercial license. Bass also seems to have some issues with Blitz, from the only threads I can find. Not sure if those were user error or have been resolved.<br><br>Audiere seems ok, though I think the API is much more convoluted and ugly than FMod and Bass. Also, not sure it's as stable and dependable as FMod and Bass.<br><br>OpenAL, same as Audiere really. Not particularly pretty and not sure it's either as dependable or stable as FMod and Bass.<br><br>I really liked the look of irrKlang, but the test of my wrapper seems to have a tendency to just not work half the time. Not sure if that's an irrKlang issue or just that I rushed the demo, but I can't see anything in the demo which could possibly cause issues. Not particularly encouraging anyway.<br><br>So what are people generally using? I'm looking for very stable, very compatible, ogg and wav support, no interest in tracker formats, and must have 3d sound, preferably in hardware and software. I'm not set on price, but if I can get a full, and extremely powerful 3d engine with integrated physics engine for $250, paying over ten times that for audio seems ridiculous. So I guess I'm saying that it's gonna have to be under $250. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I can't bear that, even if it's good. It'd be like DB Pro again. Nice functionality, shame about the syntax.<br><br>Bass appears to be out. I got a reply back, and although they're weren't 100%, they seemed to suggest that anything involving boxed copies means commercial license. I suspect a lot of developers are already flouting those rules, but I don't work that way. Shame, because Bass is lovely.<br><br>If Bass is out, FMod must surely be out as they're much more strict than Bass in the first place.<br><br>No one uses Audiere, then? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
