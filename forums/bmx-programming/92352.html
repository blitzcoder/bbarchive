Note that winows 7 does NOT include directx9. I have no idea about what happens to previous versions though. W7 (like Vista) translates all calls to DX11 (or 10 in Vista's case), however it still needs some files in order to run efficiently.

I am not even using blends.<br><br>The more I look at this problem the more I'm convinced it's a video card (GPU) driver issue.

So I called and explained it (I guess very well) to the manager and he instantly upgraded me no charge to another system with a 2.8 ghz Athlon II X2 220, more ram (from 2 to 4 gig) and "way" better monitor (50,000-1 from 5000-1 contrast). Go BestBuy. <br><br>The system I have now is an Emachines EL1352-07e. This is not the greatest system but I am really impressed with it so far. Now DX 9 works great with the same video card (GeForce 6150 ) as the last system. Both DX 7 and OpenGL work great as well. I am just just glad to be rid of the Compaq/HP system. I have never had much luck with HP. My guess is HP's implementation of the 6150 is a kludge.  <br><br>There are a "zillion" of theses (EL1352-07e) systems out there so it's perfect for developing for these kinds of entry/mid level platforms.<br><br>L8r,<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2010</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
