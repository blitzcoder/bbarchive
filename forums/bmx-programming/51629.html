Perhaps I was thinking of this older discussion, which would have been long before BlitzMax was close to completion. However, the points about automatic type casting still apply, I guess, so there are still problems to overcome.<br><br>At the risk of going off topic in my own thread, I'm a little confused about what BlitzMax is and who it's aimed at. Despite promises that none of the new stuff would be forced on beginners, a lot of it is, and it is putting them off. And yet on the other hand it's still lacking a huge number of advanced features. It seems to fall between two stools. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Never the less BlitzMAX is still in my opinion the hands down best language available, for nearly anything. Sure it lacks a few things (ad-hoc polymorphism being one, proper access modifiers being another and a decent Eclipse plug-in being absolutely essential), but it's still by far the language that produces the largest ammount of functional code, per unit of time.<br><br>Personally tho', I don't see the "new stuff being forced on beginers" as being a problem, because it's abstracted from the way computers really work, it's actually easier than doing it the procedural way. Providing you don't go overboard.<br><br>I guess seeing any language updates, that don't provide some form of advancement towards the 3D module, until said module has shipped is probably pushing it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So when compiling doStuff(i:Int,f:Float) you get the symbol doStuff_Int_Float or something, because that is different from doStuff(s:String,d:Double), which would be doStuff_String_Double.<br><br>The only limitation would be that you have to get the types exact. If you have doStuff(i:Int,f:Float), doStuff(2, 5.0) would work as it compiles down to doStuff_Int_Float. But say you did doStuff(999999999999, 5.0). That wouldn't work because it would compile down to doStuff_Long_Float, which isn't the same.<br><br>That would solve the issue of which function to choose. For the other issues like the Base/Derived example, I think an arbitrary rule would have to be set such as always pick Base or something. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You explicitly cast things if necessary in the invocation.  No arguments about potential confusion there.<br><br>Even better if there is an algorithm to do some automatic casting to get a match.  Like every other language that implements this you just have a sensible compatibility list like:<br><br>int -&gt; long, single, double<br>long -&gt; single, double<br>single -&gt; double<br><br>And a rule for matching the parameter list to condidate method signatures to choose the best one.
