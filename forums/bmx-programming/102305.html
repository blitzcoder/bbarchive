Each computer has a unspecific amount of "ports" you can use. But you can use a specific port only once at a time.<br><br>That is why you can often setup the "listen to" port, but not the "sender". As you often want to limit the sending port too - you can do something like a "port range" which your networking class then can use (it starts by the first in the range - if not available - eg another client on the same computer occupies it - it uses the next and so on).<br><br>I think Gnet relies on ENet which is using UDP.<br><br>For UDP you mostly do not directly say which port to use for sending, you just say on which you are receiving things. So each client has its own "target port" at which he wants to receive its packets.<br><br>If you have server and client in one program (eg a game - one is the host but also one of the players) this wont bring you in trouble, this is possible too.<br><br>The only thing not working properly with gnet/enet is broadcasting. <br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Exception is: you have a real server programme which is able to handle multiple "sessions" incoming on one port. Else you would have to add broadcasts for each used port - and clients would have to listen to each of the ports - how should they know?<br>So: each of your "game binaries" can only host one game. Only one "host" per computer is allowed/possible.<br>Clients are allowed more than one: they connect to the given port with a one free for them. Next client on same computer just uses another sender port to target the same one like the prior one did.<br>This works because the clients initiate the connection: they start talking with the host/master - so the master does not have to know what ports MIGHT be used... he just gets a package at his one and only open port... with a sender ip and port. <br><br>It is like your living address with house number: people can ring at your home without you needing to know where they live - but once you opened the door, you can ask them where they come from. <br><br><br><br>I oriented my code/approach to the Lobby mechanism of Warcraft III.<br><br>Instead of using "server_name" you can also use the local ip directly - as this is also "unique" in a lan. The name used in the LAN has to get read which needs other codelines.<br><br>Instead of modifiying the "identification" of a client to set it as master/server, you just add another variable in the packet.<br><br>When connecting a client to a master, your client already knows: this is the master. The master also already knows: I am the master, all connections are coming from clients.<br><br><br>so in short:<br>you create a "server": set a variable "server" to true<br>you try to connect to a server: reset that variable "server" to false.<br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
