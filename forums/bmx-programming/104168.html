For example, I stringified the array twice in a row with no operations between. The result was correct (identical strings) if I removed one method call significantly earlier in the program that would perform a shift, otherwise the console looked like this. Note the alteration of the third member. By commenting out various other lines I found that the member overwritten would change, but it would always become occupied by the object at index 0.<br><br><pre class=code>list: 1,2,A,B,C,E,F,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,a,b,c,d

If the reference counts become out of sync, you might encounter serious problems.<br><br>In this case, say you have an array of size 10 populated with objects. You shift it right by one. The refcount for object [0] is now too low by one, because it's been copied unknown to the GC into [1]; the refcount for the previous inhabitant of [9] is also too high by one and the object will probably leak.<br><br>Now my <b>guess</b> is that if something happens to clear the array, object [0] will be freed too early because it has two references in the array but only one was counted. The object's memory will then be reused for a new object (Max pools small instances). However, there's still one "live" reference to the old object floating around somewhere in the program - because it was off-by-one - and that reference now "magically" points to some object completely unrelated to what it originally aimed at because the memory has been reused ahead of schedule.<br><br>A related guess is that this is why an operation much earlier in the program is affecting this array via spooky-action-at-a-distance; objects from that array have presumably gone through some reference inc/dec cycles and had the chance to suffer for their incorrect refcount. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You can happily memmove blocks of ints and things around without any worries. However, due to the garbage-collector, you need to be careful to handle Objects correctly. Doing things with their pointers is not considered "correct" unless you know what you are doing. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This will be slower though as it involves allocating new array objects.<br><br>If you really need performance, I guess you could work something out to correct the refcounts before the shift? But you really don't want to be playing with that stuff. It's hidden so that it can change in future (e.g. your code would break if you moved over to Brucey's compiler).<br><br>If you can change the types of object, you might also have some success replacing the array of object types with a memory buffer (probably not an array, <a href="/posts.php?topic=104099" target="_blank">extern type arrays are horribly broken in 1.50</a>) of extern types. This would be totally untracked by Max, with nothing to corrupt (but you do then need to manage the memory yourself somehow). This requires some C-level programming knowledge too, but at least it's a stable and official interface. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'm trying to write substitutes for BlitzMax's native data structures and so performance is a priority, which is why I was hoping I could offload it onto simpler memory operations. I'm also wanting to have it written all in BlitzMax itself. So I'm settling for making friends with a for loop. (The aforementioned code was involved in an arraylist's insertion and removal methods.)

No need for makefiles, forward declarations, or worrying over importing the same thing multiple times makes me happy. And since I've been developing with it for so long, making anything interesting in another language entails rewriting half of my personal BlitzMax libraries and convenience functions and such.<br><br>But its syntax could be denser, it could offer method inlining, multiple inheritance, operator overloading, templates, macros, more fleshed out preprocessor directives, actual constructors, cleaner generators, a less opaque GC, it could use normal operators. Having = instead of == and &lt;&gt; instead of != for example drives me up the wall. Not having a ternary operator, too. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
