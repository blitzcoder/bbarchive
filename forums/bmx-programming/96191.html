Also, I made some mistakes in planning, since this was my first minib3d venture. I assumed that the world Z axis was "up/down" and since minb3d seems to be built around the idea that it's more like Z is in or out of the screen, I'm suffering some problems now.<br><br>GW: Try using the config tool and make sure the directories have been extracted properly. I didn't put in any checks for proper video config and file location yet, so, if other blitzmax/minib3d games work for you, this one SHOULD too.<br><br>ando: I am glad you got it working after all! Your laptop must be pretty dusty. ;) I've 4 computers at home to test it on, and the oldest is a first generation pentium 4 with a Radeon X800, and even that one runs it respectably, if I ignore the speed penalty from the aging harddrive.<br><br>Yahfree: It's written in Blitzmax with MiniB3D. And it works pretty much like Minecraft does. At least I think so, I couldn't find out that terribly much about its inner workings.<br>It's using chunks of 16x16x128 blocks to build the world, based on perlin noise. I love perlin noise. I'm only building the faces of blocks that are exposed to air, and later water, when I make the fluids working.<br>There's lots of visibility checks to make sure as little as possible overhead in rendering and keeping the meshes is in there. I store all the calculated voxel data in an array, so that I only have to rebuild the mesh when a chunk is in visible range again.<br><br>I'll probably need help with saving that voxel data though, saving it raw is not an option, since it's about 260 MB of data for a 1024x1024 map. I tried to use Gman's zip mod to compress it, but it crashes when I try to add big files to the zip. I haven't yet tried to stream the data into the compression, because I'm not quite understanding yet how it works, and I want to be sure It can still handle big files that way. I guess I could try saving it in chunks, but that is just opening another can of worms.<br>Does anyone have experience with zipping large amounts of data out of blitzmax?<br><br>I'll probably have to go down the route of saving chunks, since saving all the data at once also takes a while.<br><br>This whole chunk thing is nice for optimizing, but a nightmare to program, in my opinion. :P <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
