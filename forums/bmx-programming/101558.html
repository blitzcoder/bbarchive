In which case you could try locking both at 30 and see how that looks. You still need to separate logic and rendering (if they're not already) because there will always be hardware that can't render the requisite frames.

In a hidden object game, logic would be things like checking the mouse and hitboxes. As long as your logic is fixed, you won't miss clicks, it'll just take up to a 10th of a second. Is that really unresponsive for a hidden object game? If it is, try fifteen then.<br><br><br><div class="quote"> So they just check clicked spots every 100ms and then start eg an explosion-animation.

Anything which moves in your game is a logic function, so everything would be very jerky if you only updated your logic every 100ms. Your rendering loop should "tween" (essentially a linear interpolation) between two logic frames. Sprite positions, scale, rotations, colours, animation, particles - they can all be tweened. Although, since particles don't really need to be fixed unless they're ultra-realistic and involve collisions - you could probably not bother fixing them at all. Mark (Sibly) posted a very simple sample in the Blitz3D code archives many years ago.<br><br>If memory serves, BlitzMax doesn't have this functionality inbuilt but it's not hard to implement it yourself. I still consider Glenn Fiedler's article "Fix Your Timestep" to be the "bible" on the subject if you're interested.<br><br><a href="http://gafferongames.com/game-physics/fix-your-timestep/" target="_blank">http://gafferongames.com/game-physics/fix-your-timestep/</a><br><br><br><div class="quote"> So this means: to have your bullets correctly fly towards a wall, we have enough updates for physics.

Games where bullet collisions have to be perfect would definitely want to run more physics cycles than basic GUI cycles.<br><br><div class="quote"> We do not talk about 1-2% of performance... we talk about 50+%. <br></div><br>Indeed. I've never worked on a hidden object game, but I would imagine some have pretty complex 2d collision checking at a pixel level. Even with modern hardware, that's not trivial. You're hardly going to be offloading it to the GPU, after all. Doing it fifty times a second when you might only need to do it ten or fifteen could make a huge difference. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That is why for "me" this is a problematic thing with updateCycles/s &lt; frames/s (with frames = portions of an image containing an animation frame).<br><br>@fix your timestep<br>Already using it for a long time now. But rewrote it this week to make sure it does what it should do because I had problems with the BlitzMax-Floats:<br>(tween + (1-tween)) &lt;&gt; 1<br>So a figure absolutely relying on the tweened position jiggered around a bit ("shaking"). At the end I had to make a helper function which takes out the jiggle. <br><br><pre class=code>
	'returns the tweened value between the aimed value and the backup value
	'if avoidShaking is true, the old value is returned if the position did
	'not change that much 
	Method getTweenResult:float(currentValue:float, oldValue:float, avoidShaking:int=TRUE)
		local result:float = currentValue * getTween() + oldValue * (1.0 - getTween())
		if avoidShaking and Abs(result - currentValue) &lt; 0.1 then return currentValue
		return result
	End Method
</pre><br><br>Maybe that is only a BlitzMax-problem (somebody knowing workarounds?).<br><br><br>Conclusion: I might have a too narrow view of "logic updates" with doing all "non draw" parts there (eg. "spritePos :+1", "alpha :*0.95" or such simple one liners) - like you said much is possible as soon as you take the tweenValue into account. For me each (with 10 logic/s compared to 60 render/s) logic thing done with logic saves cycle time. If having to check / take into consideration tweening for every sprite change it is done 5 times more than needed per second.<br>I know... if I doubled logic to 20/s I would also double other calculations... hmmm tradeoff...<br>so it surely is just a matter of ones project.<br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
