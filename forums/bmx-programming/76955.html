Wouldn't that be simpler and quicker than writing a new compiler?<br><br>That aside, what really would be involved in making a compiler that compiles for the iPhone? I presume the libraries and stuff which would be hosted on the iPhone are usually only available within the iPhone emulator running under osX and may not be available ON osX itself? That would be one problem I think.<br><br>Another solution could be to write some kind of BlitzMax code compiler plugin type thingymajig for XCode so that it can natively compile BlitzMax code?<br><br>Or how about someone write in Objective-C or whatever the iPoney needs, a `wrapper` for BlitzMax which uses it like an SDK library or like a script interpreter like BriskVM and so forth? Interpreted Max code might still be able to run at a decent speed as a script language? Are there any Blitz code script engines out there already perhaps which are written in C or something that could be easily adapted?<br><br>Just some ideas. I think it's DEFINITELY a very good prospect for Indie developers in particular, who would be able to write relatively small low-art-asset type of games for the iPhone and churn them out pretty quickly without needing a huge budget. I would be very interested in supporting it if we could find a way to make it happen. I don't think we can expect Mark to do it right now since we have pressured him so much into getting Max3D done. So it'd have to be more or less a third party effort. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Blitzmax is great (it works on 3 OS's!!!), but this isn't the first time I've seen someone wanting Blitzmax on &lt;insert new platform here&gt; because it's the only language they seem 'familiar' with instead of giving other languages for that platform a try. <br><br>Guess what? By the time Blitzmax hits the iPhone (if at all),  it will already be saturated by mediocre games and difficult for anyone to stand out.

When you launch the application, the "main" function (the standard entry point in C programmming) only creates an autorelease poll (it is an object which simply collects garbage in your code and then frees it after the current event has been processed), and enters de UIApplicationMain() function, passing the name of your main class to it. This function is responsible for all the event handling. It first initialises your main class, and calls its "applicationDidFinishLaunching" method (I am quoting from memory, not completely sure that's the exact name). Here you put your initialization code, which in my case is initializing the OpenGL context, initializing Lua (and calling it's "init" script function), and setting up a timer which ticks 25 times per second. Then the function returns control to the event handler, which will call a function every time my timer ticks. In that function, I want to call a "frame" function in my script, which will update all game logic, and then render another frame.<br><br>In fact, it is really simple, and works well. If someone writes a BlitzMax-like scripting engine in C, it would work the same way. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
