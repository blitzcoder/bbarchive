A big part of the problem with the other methods is that they involve a lot of SetColor calls, not to mention a whole lot of drawrects.  <br><br>Any ideas?<br><br>It's funny that per-pixel color cycling was for so long such a low-rent effect that was taken for granted but now it's not quite so easy because for support in hardware you have to use shaders and I don't want to go that far... or maybe there is a simple way using a postprocess effect?  Inquiring minds want to know.<br><br>One little piece of source I had was this, I don't know where I found this but it doesn't look like my coding style. [Turns out it's Maverick69, here: http://www.blitzbasic.com/codearcs/codearcs.php?code=2083] This doesn't do cycling but it does smooth fading between RGB values.<br><br>Probably I should just use tileimage with a prerendered plasma and then use masking and call it good.  However, the masking method does not do everything I would like it to, like plot on top of detailed backgrounds.<br><br>Maybe I could grabimage a piece of the background, draw with maskcolor on top of that, draw a rectangle of plasma the same size, then drawrect the masked background piece on top of that.  But there you're running into the slowness of grabimage and that's just doubleplus ungood (if you speak C++ or 1984...)  At a certain point of diminishing returns with that you're hands down better off with grabpixel, setcolor and plot and that's really saying something.<br><br>!!?!!?! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I get semi-acceptable framerates (around 40 fps) for a whole-screen write from an array with drawrect, with doubled pixels, but that's overkill if only some things are going to be cycling, if you want different things cycling at different rates, etc.  <br><br>So I wrote a sprite class that stores only the pixels you want in a list.  Then you call the update method on your sprite instance and all the pixels get cycled depending on your update algorithm.<br><br>There may or may not be a better way to do this but it's really just for small throwaway effects like little numbers that appear and flash for a moment if you get some bonus or something like that.  For that, the speed hit should be negligible.<br><br>If you wanted to get complicated you could have different colors in the source image get loaded into different colorsprites with different cycling algorithms.  Writing this stuff is one thing, figuring out what to do with it is much harder.<br><br>Should also have a color cycling table, a parameterized version of the copperlist builder from the previous post, so the colors are hand picked.<br><br><pre class=code>' colorcycling by list

The bottleneck seems to be the drawrect calls, not the list lookups though that certainly can't help.  Of course you could use an arraystack of coords or even five arrays, one each for x,y, r, g and b, and that would probably be the fastest but I don't think the list itself is a particularly bad hit.  For the update() and the draw() I'm getting around 1 millisecond total and a raw array walk was 25-30 though it was the full screen area rather than only a part.<br><br>The inspiration for this is stuff like <br><iframe width="560" height="345" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/JyVRNkASegI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>and<br><iframe width="560" height="345" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/hBevE9emmPc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>demos that are extremely eyepopping and cool especially when you consider the negligible hardware available, something like 1/10,000 what we have on our desktops if there's even any sort of measure at all.  As you say Angros it's pretty funny not only that we have to go through contortions to emulate this stuff on modern hardware and that it's surprisingly taxing even then.  There's got to be some way to come up with a color cycling shader but that's even MORE ridiculous and difficult that we have to bring to bear the graphics super-ultracomputers that we have as piddly $200 daughterboards.  I still don't know how these guys got stuff looking so good on hardware that old but their techniques tend to be pretty simple and the looks are the result of artistic and design talent, which are the things the runners up didn't have.<br><br>Since this is going to go through a cycle table and is mainly for pretty small sprites instead of full screen crazy demo effects, the next step is to precache the cycling steps but it's probably not worth bothering with considering that they won't be close to filling up the screen.<br><br>Coppermaster by Corsair above is arguably one of the best demos ever released in terms of design and inventive workarounds and it's aged very well considering it's 25 years old, much better in fact than the demos which used "cutting edge" 3D graphics which are basically unwatchable these days.<br><br>A recursive partitioning method that would fit the largest possible rects for a given space and then draw rects of that size would vastly decrease the number of draw calls.<br><br>As for the initial setup time for the grab, perhaps the data structure can be pregenerated and incbinned or stored on disk.  That is probably what I will end up doing.  Of course what the Old Guard would have done would have been to display a picture (usually pixelpainted by a precocious thirteen year old hanger-on from the BBS) or other sort of flash during the grab which would be easy to do here considering that the pixels are loaded into the data structure piecemeal.  You could easily do it during a menu screen. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
