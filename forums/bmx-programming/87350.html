Specifically, don't use BLIde managed solutions; unmanaged ones are ok but it's probably best not to commit the actual solution file.<br><br>Send me an email or post in here if you're up for it, and I'll add you to a sourceforge project if I get two people other than me (after I figure out how to use sourceforge). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Letting everybody just throw a piece of code it's not going to work. The leader needs to assign tasks to himself and to others. Before that can be done, there needs to be an idea for what type of game its going to be made. as it stands, I could throw code for a 3d shooter, somebody else might throw code for a side scroller game, someone else a SHMUP or a Match 3 and on... Treat this as if it's a business(A fun business maybe but none the less a business). Get a group first(each person interested needs to commit him/herself put at least 5(just a number it can be anything) hours of work each week and a deadline to complet the task. it needs to be know that the programmer it's going to be responsible for the task and report progress on a regular basis. <br>on the top of this thread get a list going to list the names of programmers who wants to join. Even before the group is set, start brain storming ideas for the type of game that is going to be made. <br><br>1st. I suggest to get a list of the types of games know off and get votes on each. I say on 3 game ideas with the most votes do the easiest one just to get the first project going. <br><br>2nd. Everybody needs to brainstorm it; everybody need to create a rough draft storyline. The ideas can either be combined together, select one and dump the others, or add to a main one from the others. It might be rough for someone that thinks his/her idea is the best and not be chosen but if it's going to be like a business than that is the way the cookie crumbles and everyone needs to be able to put up with it. <br><br>3rd. Get the modes, input(keyboard joystick and mouse controller done), and high score storage input output done. Possibly a nice but simple framework before the game is even started. I have noticed that all of the projects that get started here neglect that and at the end nobody wants to do it. this is where leader ship skills in delegating comes in hand.<br><br>4th. the leader should be able to direct the team programmers on how to get the individual's code in to the game to make it work. there should be guidelines for code to be accepted:  Certain variables in certain format(such as in a type) to be passed back and forth between individual's code.<br><br>5th. just get it done. As long as no major bugs are found it should be considered ALPHA stage. At this point; speed slow, no problem; graphics suck, no problem; control not optimal, no problem. even though it is as I said it doesn't mean that each coders should not try to do their best. it's just that I believe that everybody wants to see some type of accomplishment and the best way to do it is by having their work in a finished product. At this point, work to improve and make it better.<br><br>6th. present it for criticism. what does everybody think of it? What type of bugs are found? What is missing to get it commercial quality? What can be done to satisfy a large crowd? take advice and suggestions and learn.<br><br>7th. lucky number :-). Do the team have enough talent to get a commercial project out? if Yes. wha are you waiting for? Get started! if not, are talented people willing to enlist now that there is a finished project? If yes, Do it! If not, at least everybody here learned, what in my opinion is, a nice business model or maybe not. It might just be my inexperience peeking out.

Look at any open source project, none of them started as 'let's just throw anything together'. They start with a solid direction and goal, and most of the time a small (usually 1 person) team gets something up and going before others start adding to it. It's easy to have multiple people building onto different parts of a house. It's pretty much impossible to try to build a house from scratch with no blueprints and everyone sticking up walls and stuff wherever they please with no coordination.<br><br>That being said, I've always like the idea of a somewhat modular game. Maybe a platformer that has all enemies, objects, and levels scripted, allowing people to make levels with a great deal of variety, but keeping the gameplay somewhat the same. That is, the map/collision/sprite systems probably need to somewhat concrete. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There are some rules I've put in the CONTRIBUTIONS (a poorly-chosen name since it's not actually a list of people's contributions) file that should hopefully put at least a few safeguards in place to prevent issues with commits.  I'll quote it here for those less inclined to read things not in posts:<br><br><pre class=code>10/21/09

If you would like to make contributions to this project, please observe the following rules:

RULES

1.   All source code must use \n line endings.  Windows line-endings (\r\n) and other variants (\r only) will
be rejected, because this really screws up diffs and makes commits much more difficult to work with since 
determining what has and has not changed in a commit is incredibly difficult.

1a.  Use of the default MaxIDE (specifically versions shipped with BlitzMax) is forbidden due to rule 1.  If
you need alternatives, please consider using ConTEXT, BLIde, TextMate, Smultron, VIM, Emacs, gedit, etc.

2.  Do not commit files for working with projects (e.g., ConTEXT projects, BLIde solutions, TextMate
projects, and so on).  Due to the nature of bmk compiling everything from a single file, these are
unnecessary and only serve to make commits unnecessarily complicated.

3.   All source code must be available under the z-lib/libpng license.

3a.  If using other source code, libraries, etc., that code must be compatible with the z-lib/libpng license
or used in such a way that they are compatible within the context of their use.

4.   Hard tabs only.  Soft tabs (e.g., 4 spaces to indent) cause more trouble than they're worth.

5.   No trailing whitespace on lines.  This isn't likely to be an issue, but it has come up in some projects,
so please take care to avoid it.

This list may be amended, appended, prepended, modified, and what have you as work progresses.
</pre><i>On 1a, I'm not entirely sure if BLIde or Smultron can specify the type of line-ending, so they may be excluded in the future.</i><br><br>Feel free to rename the CONTRIBUTIONS file if you want.  I've added you as a contributor, Peter, so go nuts (within the confines of the above).

There have been a ton of 'community projects', and many of them -started- similar to this. I personally submitted the first piece of code (just some tile-map drawing code with layers and scrolling) to a similar project back in the bcoder days. I don't remember what happened to it exactly, but if I remember correctly no more code was written. I believe the project died from the planning being really 'open'. With random people chiming in with their thoughts on the direction the game should take, we ended up with something along the lines of a side-scrolling platformer starring some guy with bionic arms (I actually started drawing sprites for this, even though I hated the idea...), and then alot of ideas contrary too.

When you all look at the plan and see no need to modify anything, and all thats left is coding/creating... off you go... Just IMHO <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You don't control the warriors directly, but by manipulating the landscape, or changing their role (jumper, marcher, blocker..) you guide your men towards the enemy.<br><br>That actually sounds pretty awesome, similar to what I had in mind, but probably more realistic in scope.<br><br>Instead of a base just pumping out tanks that you assign jobs to, maybe you could mix parts in a hopper or something to get what you want. For instance, drop a cannon and a drill into the hopper, and you get a tank that drills through walls and attacks enemies when it encounters them. <br></div><br><br>Ok, If someone doesn't make this game I'm going to scoop it up LOL <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
