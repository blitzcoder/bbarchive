What used to be a high resolution 640x480 is now the bare minimum resolution and most hardware doesn't even support 320x240/320x200 anymore. 1024x768 is now the more popular web browsing resolution with over %50 of people using it. Furthermore, 1024x768, 1280x1024 and 1600x1200 are now the most popular general use resolutions, particularly popular with modern gamers. Now we have 1920x1200 as high definition displays for next gen consoles. Windows Vista and OSX Leopard both now have fully resolution independent interfaces and it seems like the resolutions just keep going up.<br><br>One problem for us game developers is how to provide support, graphically, for these higher resolutions. When you start to think about supporting more than one resolution, rather than just picking 640x480, 800x600 or 1024x768, not only do you get into aspect ratio issues, both in the display and then in turn in the bitmaps you create, but also issues with how to scale or represent the graphics clearly and with the best detail in all resolutions. <br><br>1) How do you do it?<br><br>2) Do you have one high resolution set of graphics that you scale down to fit the resolution?<br><br>3) How do you scale it so the low-resolution displays aren't over-antialiased looking?<br><br>4) Do you rely solely on computer-generated realtime graphics like 3D or vector-line based graphics?<br><br>5) Are we moving away from pregenerated bitmaps?<br><br>6) If we are to have pregenerated bitmaps in a game, with handdrawn art, how can this best be made to work with these increasingly high and optional resolutions all within the same game?<br><br>7) And finally, what resolution(s) is the highest that your current project intends to support? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You pretty much have to decide on an aspect ratio and stick with it. That means letterboxing 4:3 to go widescreen or the opposite if you stick with 4:3.

I have a widescreen monitor which is 16:10 so it would be `easiest` for me to draw gfx in that format and then stretch it.<br><br>I'm not sure though why you have to stick to one aspect ratio? I am thinking to support multiple aspect ratios. The graphics files with have an aspect ratio of their own which is based on their resolution and how they were generated to look normal. Then I think I'm going to have that data scaled in x/y to fit the aspect of the display if the pixel coverage is different. I want to be able to support widescreen and plan to make my game adjust to use all of the available pixels. I think widescreen support is a good selling point.<br><br>Not sure why you'd have gaps in your gui though? Because you use bitmaps for gui elements and don't scale them?<br><br>I think I might go with a 1600x1200 sort of resolution for the bitmaps in 5:4 or 4:3 aspect and then size accordingly. Did you find any troubles with scaling images down to 640x480? I tried different scaling algorithms in a graphics package and they seemed to give varying results. The lanczos scaling is pretty okay, as is a `smoothing` resample. I also think it helps to sharpen the scaled image a bit to undo some of the over-antialiasing and give the same textural sharpness feel of the higher resolution.<br><br>Also at the wikipedia the page on `display resolution` is pretty interesting. I think it would be a good idea to have a `database` of common display sizes and their known aspect ratio's, there's only really a few aspects to detect - 16:10, 16:9, 5:4, 4:3. If the user then picks a given resolution you can probably guess which aspect ratio it fits best into, otherwise blitzmax has no way of telling you what the aspect is. One problem I have though is stretched displays which throws that all out the window, e.g. 1024x768 stretched to a 16:10 aspect.<br><br>I guess the other part of what I'm asking is how relevant will pre-generated graphics be in future since it is something of a struggle to support multiple resolutions and aspect ratios and especially high resolutions. Who is going to spend time hand-drawing art at 2560x2048, or even have it be generated by a 3d app at a high resolution? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It just depends how your GUI/HUD is designed. If you've got a health bar, a few score indicators and a crosshair in the middle of the screen, you can do whatever you please. When you have a complex painted GUI which fills the width and/or height of the screen ( and to look good NEEDS to do that ) you're snookered one way or the other.<br><div class="quote"> Not sure why you'd have gaps in your gui though? Because you use bitmaps for gui elements and don't scale them? <br></div><br>Picture a complex GUI which goes right along the top and right down the left hand side of the screen. It appears to be one big bitmap image, but it's probably made out of smaller pieces aligned carefully. <br><br>Let's say you're in 1024x768. And it looks beautiful. Put that into a different aspect ratio ( let's say 1280x768 ) and what do you do? <br><br>You scale it up to match the new resolution, right?<br><br>So the screen is wider now, right? But not longer? So you scale your bitmaps in width, but not height.Now - oops - those lovely perfectly circular buttons which are embedded into the GUI are now elliptical.<br><br>Ok, that won't work. So you scale disproportionately to keep your ratios even, right? You scale the height as well to keep the aspect ratio of your bitmaps the same. Ah, but - oops - now you scaled your images in both dimensions but the resolution is no higher than it was before and now the bottom of your GUI is off the bottom of the screen. <br><br>So all you've got left to do is see which dimension scaled the least and scale in both dimensions by that ratio. So in this example, the height hasn't changed at all, so you can't scale at all in the width without losing your perfect aspect ratio. So now you've either got a gap on the left, a gap on the right or a gap somewhere in the middle. A gap on the left won't work because the GUI needs to go down the left side of the screen. A gap in the middle won't work because it leaves a honking great hole in your painted GUI/HUD. So you have to leave a big area of blank space in the top right corner which wasn't there at 1024x768. Is it tolerable? I guess, but it's not ideal, is it?<br><br>For simpler games, it won't matter and you can do as you please. But for games with a complex, painted GUI ( google some pictures of Company of Heroes for a perfect example of a complex GUI that would cause the problem I'm describing ) you just can't do it perfectly.<br><br>On the plus side, be glad that you're taking this seriously. A lot of commercial games, big-ass retail games don't take this seriously and half the GUI stuff is squished to the point where you can't read it in some less standard aspect ratios. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Reminds me of the problem with website as well where if you want to draw a nice graphic you're pretty much stuck with it when the user has a larger desktop, leaving a big gap at the side. I made a website for a company I worked for and this was inevitably the problem. It had nice graphics n'all but it couldn't scale. Part of that is the limitation of browsers and html but partly also this same resolution issue. I didn't even consider aspect ratio at the time so I'm sure it looks warped on some displays.<br><br>I appreciate that you recognize also this is in important thing to consider. If I add some kind of feature to a game or whatever I want to be sure that it is fully and completely implemented and supported and consistent and done properly, not just some half-*** job which detracts from the quality.<br><br>I understand the issues with a GUI, thanks for describing it. I had forgotten about how fixed gfx have a problem when filling a screen. I am going to try to make a scalable gui setup so some parts are sort of fixed or will scale in proportion, while other parts stretch or allow bits to rearrange to fill the space or just ad some kind of `attractive gaps`. Ultimately though I'd like it to look good and play good in whatever resolution or aspect is thrown at it. To me that makes it `solid` and reliable. I also want to be able to provide increased graphical glory to the people with the gfx cards that can handle it, without requiring excess unused texture space for people running at a lower res. Gotta appeal to the niches.<br><br>I guess some of the fortunate things these days with hardware accelerated graphics is you can composite things and build textured buttons and such on the fly in realtime which at least gives some opportunities to have it scale well. It's just mainly the handdrawn art that is a problem.<br><br>I suppose one final option is to try going with fully scalable vector graphics, but the rendering time increases a lot and it's harder to make detailed art that can render realtime.<br><br>The questions I asked above aren't really "I don't know how to do it" questions, it's more that I just wanted to find out how everyone else is doing it and get some discussion going.

For every 4 pixels across you have 3 pixels down. If you multiply that up, you get to something like 1024x768. On my monitor, 1024 across is exactly 12 inches physically measured, and 768 down is exactly 9 inches measured. 12/9 is 1.33. Also 1024x768 is 1.33, and 4/3 is 1.33.<br><br>Why is the physical size of the display (12" x 9") the exact same ratio as the ratio of the pixels? Why didn't they make a perfectly square monitor 9" x 9" with 4:3 aspect for the pixels? Does this mean the pixels are perfectly square? I did try to draw a 100x100 rectangle and measured it and it was perfectly square. Are all resolutions always perfectly square regardless of the aspect ratio, and is the aspect ratio then just the ratio of total width to total height or is there sometimes (in computer displays) a difference?<br><br>I suppose here's a comparison:<br><br>640x480 is 4:3 aspect<br>640x512 is 5:4 aspect<br><br>They probably consume the same *physcal* screen space?<br><br>So if you draw a 100x100 rectangle in the 640x512 screen it will look more like a rectangle than a square?<br><br>So not all resolutions have square pixels?<br><br>*getting confused*<br><br>Would it be because I have an LCD display, and LCD displays have a fixed pixel shape, so the pixels are always *physically* the same aspect ratio, so 1024x768 has to be letterboxed?<br><br>So.... non-LCD displays probably don't have a fixed pixel shape?<br><br>How does one determine the pixel shape if it has nothing to do with the width and height in pixels? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So I guess the ratio you get from width/height is not the same thing as the actual `aspect ratio` of the pixels themselves. In 320x200 the pixels are taller.<br><br>I am guessing that LCD displays have a fixed pixel shape/size, that some gfx cards do hardware scaling to make a resolution and is totally unpredictable, and that CRT monitors could probably do all kinds of different resolutions at different amounts of stretching, so using width/height has no real reliable bearing on whether or not something drawn will be exactly square or a perfect circle physically.<br><br>For that we probably need to know the dot pitch or the physical dimension of the resolution. So I'm not sure how to offer aspect ratio support. I want to support widescreen and other aspects. I suppose I could assume that for the most part width/height would work for 4:3 ratio e.g.640x480, 1024x768 and just hope that most of the time this means I know the size of the display and its ratio. But sometimes this won't work. e.g. on my widescreen, 1024x768 can appear in 4:3 aspect AND in 16:10 aspect stretched. No way to tell between them.<br><br>So we probably have to just offer some kind of manual `x stretch` and `y stretch` within the game, that the user can and has to tweak for each display mode? I just wish there were ways to make it more automated so the user doesn't have to fiddle with it to make it look right. I suppose for most modes you could offer 5:4, 4:3, 3:2, 16:10 and 16:9 as default settings and try to guess the closest one based on the width/height ratio, then if the user has something out of the ordinary, let them tweak it? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Thanks for your comments. I agree with most of what you said.<br><br>I think what I'm going to do is assume that the aspect ratio, as derived by Width/Height, gives square pixels and that pretty much most displays will be approximately the same physical proportion. I will detect some of the more common aspect ratios and resolutions and create an automatic adjustment as close as predictably possible and then provide a manual adjustment within the game in realtime to tweak the x and y stretching. The gamer might want to stretch the display even when it's meant to be normal and might `like` a wide stretched look &amp; feel. I remember liking the 640x256 mode on the Amiga since the fonts changed shape. I think this will be the best way to go and is pretty much what you said minus it being too user friendly. For the rest of em I will have a calibration screen or mode where they can tweak the stretching. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
