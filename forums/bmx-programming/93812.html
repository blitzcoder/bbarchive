It's a really cool project, a very DIFFERENT and innovative type of game, and it already has a strong fanbase and support.<br><br>We're looking for strong C/C++ programmers who know 2D/3D game programming concepts and ideally — BlitzMax! We're using a combination of BlitzMax, MiniB3D, and straight up C++ to do this project.<br><br>Our offices are located at the Plug and Play Tech Center in Sunnyvale, CA at 440 N Wolfe Rd.<br><br>We're looking to start hiring immediately, and please shoot an email to me at jtfrench [at] gmail [dot] com if you are interested in the project and I can share more details with you.<br><br>This is NOT a telecommuting position, so we would need someone who is nearby and can kick it with us.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Jason <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Why not just make it in a language you can debug yourself, or pay someone to code the entire thing on their own so it doesn't get riddled with errors in the first place. Memory allocation issues and "pointer arithmetic problems" (whatever that means, I wasn't aware the rules differed by architecture) don't just spring up for no reason, they spring up because you're not coding it properly. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Hiring someone purely to deal with memory allocation issues and pointer arithmetic problems does indeed sound like bad economics, because they shouldn't be happening. <br><br>BlitzMax is very performant (as is C#, which Czar Flavius also mentions) and it's unlikely that a programmer who needs someone to fix the kind of issues discussed would be capable of writing code which ran faster than moderately competent BlitzMax or C# anyway.<br><br>Obviously, neither of us knows why C++ is being discussed, and there may be valid reaons (completely unrelated to performance) why it's an essential headache, but there really ought to be very significant pros in order to make a move like that. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Additionally the logical reason to use php is so you don't need to write a comms protocall and or you want to use a shared server or something else that won't let you run your own daemon since it all runs via http. You can also easily encrypt the communications by just using https, those are usually pretty big factors when designing a server. It's far from optimal for twitch gaming obviously where speed is everything, but if it's got a Facebook or other web client that's not likely... Additionally php can translate to perl or c very easily in future. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But alas, this is the Internet, and I guess that's what anonymity encourages :)<br><br>I know very well how to write C, C++, BlitzMax, and a bunch of other languages. I didn't graduate from Brown University's computer science program or work for Apple on Snow Leopard not learning those. I've written my own compilers, designed my own processors, built my own POSIX operating systems, and bunch of other stuff and have no problem handling the types of issues that arise out of that.<br><br>I simply said "paying an engineer to debug memory issues" as to give a pat on the back to how friendly BlitzMax is, and how quickly it is to get things running. I'm not literally hiring someone to deal with pointer arithmetic. It was a geeky joke — sorry that didn't come across. I already have a bunch of the game written using BlitzMax as the abstraction layer around C++.<br><br>My point is — I'm not going to take all of that out and re-do, when I can ship the game in a few months. I'd rather ship, and then re-write it in C++ --- when I have a) a released product, and b) more cash in the bank so I can hire people w/ very strong tech backgrounds to compliment my own.<br><br>If you're not interested, or if it sounds ridiculous (Czar Flavius/Gabriel) simply don't apply! No need to troll.<br><br>@SLotman &amp; ima747 --- I think you guys get a little more about what I'm talking about.<br><br>Also @Slenkar: to say "PHP is slow" is a bit of an unfounded statement. It all depends on how you use it. Would I write Halo 3 w/ a PHP backend? No. Could you write a multiplayer turn-based card game w/ a PHP backend? Yes! My project is not an action-based game with fast-moving objects that need to be tracked across a wide number of servers w/ little to no latency. This is a game which was a text-based, HTML game to begin with ----PHP/MySQL very easily handled it. Putting a visual layer on it just gives more for the player to chew on and play with their senses without actually increasing the stress on the server. You'd have to know a little more about the game to see what I mean.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
