It is saving "Heavy Cruiser"<br>Because shipclass is equal to heavy cruiser.<br><br>I print shipclass and it says "Heavy Cruiser"<br><br>Yet if I try an if statement after restoring it doesn't read. If shipclass = "Heavy Cruiser" then xxx.<br><br>What is happening is that when I save, I know the shipclass is gone bonkers and it isn't being read as it displays because other ship functions associated with being a heavy cruiser stopped working. When I load, it's working again. So it saved fine to the file, it's just that when I save it real time, the player's object typically is the one that is being updated and his/her current variables, in this case his shipclass.<br><br>Any ideas what could be going wrong? I narrowed it down after many hours to shipclass somehow doing something wonky when I save, but it continues on and when I load that save, its fine.<br><br>Any help would be sincerely appreciated,<br><br>Justin <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Also after so many hours narrowing it down and checking and re-checking I was positive that the save file was good and the save/restore was in good working order and I was not making any mistakes there.<br><br>Which I why I concluded that the mistake had to be how I was using writestring with SHIPCLASS.<br><br>But sorry for the winded explanation, I said all that to say that I cannot understand what I have done wrong with writestring and shipclass. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
