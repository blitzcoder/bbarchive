When drawing a full texture `image` the texture coords will range from 0,0 to 1,1 ie covering the full texture, mapped onto the vertices of a quad of geometry (which is actually 2 triangles). When you draw a `sub image`, you are just adjusting the texture coordines so that the corners of your quad are referencing a smaller portion of that texture. And like others have said, there are VERY good reasons to do this. Without even testing it, it is highly recommended (as in Unity) that you put as many sprites/tiles into as few actual images/textures as possible because every time Blitz has to tell the hardware to switch (bind) a new image/texture there is significant overhead. You can only usually do that around a few hundred times per frame on desktop machines before it severely affects the framerate. Yet when you minimize texture swaps using larger texture sheets and `subimagerect` you should be able to draw a tonne more stuff. This is why people on the Unity forums have been having an absolute spaz about the built-in GUI being `slow` because it originally had no sprite-sheet-based back-end and instead introduced a new `draw call` for every GUI element, which became slow really quickly (now fixed in Unity 4).<br><br>Someone here came up with some kind of graphics driver thing that automatically batched sprites into sprite sheets, you may want to search for it. It's also useful to use some kind of vertex arrays because every time you draw an image or a portion of an image, it is working in `immediate mode` instructions, ie it issues lots of API function calls for every image you draw in sequence, and doesn't optimize at all. If your geometry is static/non animating or even if it is, you will see at least 200% speed increase on most systems using vertex arrays. Again someone came up with a driver thingy for this somewhere around here.<br><br>As far as OpenGL/DX goes, basically there is absolutely zero difference between drawing the full image versus drawing part of it. The only thing that varies are the texture coordinates. They should render exactly the same speed, if the caching and number of pixels etc are the same. If one is slower it's due to some blitz overhead.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
