I personally dislike that as when reading the code, unless you wrote it, then you'll need to know the 'type' of the variable to accurate read and decipher bugs. How do you know which 'version' of the variable is being updated by looking at a section of code? Especially if the language allows automatic 'numeric to string' and 'string to numeric' conversion.<br><br>Saying that... some newer languages are making use of 'type inference', which means the type of the variable is determined by its initial value, ie A = "test" will mean A becomes a string type, and A = 10 means A will be of an integer type.

Most languages that are worth their salt pretty much all do the exact same thing but will use a syntax that suits the language designer.<br><br>I'll never understand the logic of allowing 2 variables of different types with the same name to be used at the same time, that school of thought is way too 'old school' for me :D<br><br>The next set of paragraphs are going to be me brainstorming and typing at the same time so bear with me and hopefully I could help clear the fog for yourself and maybe even help others too, you may also know a lot of what I'm about to say but here goes...<br><br>Anyway, my BASIC is seriously rusty but...<br>In BlitzMax the <b>side :| LEFT_SIDE</b> is equivalent to <b>Let side = side | LEFT_SIDE</b>. The vertical bar is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR" target="_blank">bitwise or operator</a>. Whats the BASIC bitwise or operator nowadays? simply 'OR'?<br><br>So using the 'bitwise or' link as an example along side your algorithm, it shows 4 bits. You could think of each 'bit' as a flag to represent each of the 4 sides, if the side has been checked then its bit will become 1, if it hasnt been checked then it will be 0.<br><br>As already mentioned, variable names should really be named in a way that describe what they are used for and using a descriptive variable name is easier than trying to remember numbers or letters. You already have your own system for this, but it only works for you. If you want to show other people how an algorithm works then descriptive names are a must have! Comments alone are not enough, honestly.<br><br>Back to 'binary bits'... so that you don't have to remember that a 'bit set' value is a particular value, ie bit1 ( when set ) has a value of 1, and bit2 has a value of 2, bit3 has a value of 4 and bit4 has a value of 8 you can create a variable name to represent each bit value, hence LEFT_SIDE = 1, RIGHT_SIDE = 2, TOP_SIDE = 4, BOTTOM_SIDE = 8.<br><br>Using the 'bitwise or' is kinda like including the bit value into another variable/value. It doesn't 'add' the value! very important! it will only include that bit value into the destination value, and if that bit is already set then there is no change. To help understand these, there are what are called <a href="http://www.teach-ict.com/gcse_computing/ocr/212_computing_hardware/binary_logic/miniweb/pg5.htm" target="_blank">'binary operator truth tables'</a> that are used for binary logic operations. Some programming languages have more binary operators than others, it all depends on the language creator which ones are in the language.<br><br>You already have is a variable named 'sides' and you want to check if the 4 sides have been checked. Each time a side is checked take its 'bit' value and store it in the 'sides' variable. You do that by using the 'bitwise or' operator, which as said above will include the bit thats represented by either LEFT_SIDE, RIGHT_SIDE etc into the value of 'sides' .<br><br>You can then have a value that represents when ALL sides have been checked, ie when all bits have been set. That value in this case will be 'binary of 1111', 'hex F' or 'decimal 15'. So create a Const ALLSIDES:Int = 15 and when you want to check if all sides have been checkd you could simply write 'Until sides = ALLSIDES'. Even that one line change alone makes that line <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-documenting_code" target="_blank">self documenting</a>, you can look at that one single line and read exactly what its doing without looking at any other piece of code. You know what the loop is trying to achieve. I might even go a little further so instead of just 'sides' I'd call it 'SidesChecked' or similar. Which then becomes Until SidesChecked = ALLSIDES. So much easier to understand than 'Until c1+c2+c3+c4=4', and it's also arguably faster too as the cpu isn't doing the adding arithmetic every time it hits this line.<br><br>Ultimately using this technique throughout all of your code will make it much more readable to yourself and for everyone else that you want to show how your code works.<br><br>Hope it helps! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Make an array and go to town.<br><br>DIM flags!(7),v<br><br>flags!=v (where v is a value from 0-255), and then you could read flags!(7) to pull out the 8th bit (high bit) of v. Neat stuff !<br><br>This sides stuff is confusing though. If you uniquely wanted to handle 4-sides of a square, wouldn't it be easier just to have 4-variables, say, s1, s2, s3, s4 and do your mathematical wizardry around those then assign an array 1, 2, 4, 8, which is what I think you are saying ?<br><br>I don't like to do tricks like that when =I= have to understand the code myself. I still use a=1-a to flip a 'switch.' I'm certain you could use a:| (if I'm reading that right), and it would do the same thing.<br><br>But a=1-a makes a lot more sense to me, and those new programmers out there, it can also be understood. It's only when I got to B4GL did I see that there were variable shortcuts. A-=1 and a+=1 to increase a variable instead of the usual a=a-1 and a=a+1, which I'm more familiar with.<br><br>This Allsides seems very wasteful to me. Much easier just to create 4-variables and go with it.<br><br>Now, I can understand if I needed say only a C to exist, that is a [ ] |_| and |'''| then my 4-variables would come in awful handy.<br><br>if (c1=1 and c2=1 and c3=1 and c4=0)or(c1=1 and c2=1 and c3=0 and c4=1)or(c1=1 and c2=0 and c3=1 and c4=1)or(c1=0 and c2=1 and c3=1 and c4=1)then ... we have a pocket to put data in (useful for Match-3 games).<br><br>Sure, you can get tricky and say:<pre class=code>c=0
For k=0 To 7
        For n=0 To 3
          If inv[n,k]
            If n=0 Then c1=1 ' tricky, ensure that critter
            If n=3 Then c2=2 ' touches all 4-sides, no 6x8 or
            If k=0 Then c3=4 ' 8x7 sprite, always 8x8
            If k=7 Then c4=8
          EndIf
        Next
      Next</pre><br><br>And then look for your 'cup' from totals 7, 14, 11, or 13, but for legibility, go with the original: if (c1=1 and c2=1 and c3=1 and c4=0)or(c1=1 and c2=1 and c3=0 and c4=1)or(c1=1 and c2=0 and c3=1 and c4=1)or(c1=0 and c2=1 and c3=1 and c4=1). Someone can look at this and see exactly what you are doing without having to add up numbers in their head.<br><br>Anyone can get tricky in code and make it smaller and illegible, but you want people (including yourself) to be able to understand the code later. And, someone did suggest I place REMARKS in my code, and I am doing that now, and I must admit, it does help legibility and doesn't slow down the execution.<br><br>As for understanding my code, tweak it ! That's what I learned when I typed this, the first computer program I ever entered when I was 8-years old.<br><br>http://willus.com/trs80/?-a+1+-p+126050+-f+1<br><br>Sure I didn't understand it. Took me 4 tries to type it the right way. But once I ran it, I wanted to change it. I modified numbers, variables, all kinds of things. I tweaked it, and I think I learned more than if someone tried to explain to me all the commands instead.<br><br>In truth, I've read very few books on programming. I'm always learning from example code, have all my life - and, as life turns around, now I am the one providing source code, hopefully so a younger me out there can copy the code (they don't have to type it anymore) and TWEAK the code and learn from it to see how it changes. :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
