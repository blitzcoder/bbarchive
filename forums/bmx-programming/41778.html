The same applies to languages like Objective-C where messages (function calls) go through a runtime system, making them slower than direct function calls. The overhead is so small in the 'big picture' that it can be mostly ignored. If you are really interested in performance, then just use a function call for those bits that need to be fast. An OO language does not take any extra time to call a normal function than a language like C.<br><br>Languages that run on virtual machines, such as Java and Smalltalk, may be slower because of the overhead of the VM. However, Java is not particularly slow. Some of the libraries, such as Swing, may be slow but the core language is not. <br><br>Delphi's performance has never been too hot. Sure, it compiles very, very quickly, but runtime performance has always lagged far behind good C/C++ compilers. Its optmisations are a bit of a joke, and only in the latest version has it finally got inline function calls. Still, the point is that it does not matter, because it is perfectly fine for what it is intended for.<br><br>It is better to worry about correct choice of algorithm. If the compiler is reasonably modern, a bad, or good, algorithm has a much bigger impact on application performance than anything the compiler does, or doesn't do, in the way of optimisation, or whether it is OO or not. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Structure (type) members can be accessed directly by using an offset from the base of the structure, which is determined at _compile time_ because the compiler knows the size of the types in the structure. A custom type is probably stored as a pointer, rather than directly in the structure, so this has to be dereferenced to get to the actual storage for the object, but that applies to custom types outside structures as well.<br><br>De-referencing refers to the act of accessing something through a pointer to that thing, at runtime. A virtual method table is a list of function pointers. A method is called by de-referencing this pointer to get to the actual address of the code to be performed. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
