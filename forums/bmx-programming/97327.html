This new version does save all document status (open/not open, cursor pos, bookmarks, etc) on a separated document, so BLIde can play a lot nicer with version control system, when working on unmanaged solutions.<br>• Fixed an issue that could make several instances of BLIde read the same BLIF file, producing a streaming error that could cause a crash at BLIde start-up.<br>• Implemented an improved secure multithread file access to BLIde file handling system (based on current Jungle Ide system)<br>• Improved the time required by BLIde to generate a portable environment<br>• Fixed an issue that could make BLIde crash on a find and replace operation<br>• Fixed an issue that could make BLIde crash when saving a solution that had disposed documents after a very complex chain of file renaming<br>• Fixed an issue that was making the "Clear List" from the recent solutions menu to no clear its contents properly.<br>• Fixed a relocation handling bug for files with TLS callbacks on the Publisher<br>• Fixed an incorrect error message caused by a bug in relocation handling on Publihser<br>• Better icon compression handling in Publisher<br>• Fixed a compatibility issue that could make BLIde crash when used on an older version of the .net framework<br>• Fixed a compatibility issue that could make BLIde crash when used on a computer that had a different version of the SandDock framework in the .net 2.0 GAC<br>• Fixed a unhandled exception when a paste operation was performed on the console window, when an application was running, and the contents of the clipboard had no text equivalent.<br>• Fixed an issue that could make BLIde crash when restoring the Find and Replace preferences when the Find and Replace serialized data has been corrupted in disk becouse a hard system failure.<br>• Fixed a small issue that was making BLIde restore its location and size before setting the font DPI scaling, so the IDE window could not be storing properly its screen location between runs.<br>• Fixed an issue that could make BLIde crash when reloading an already disposed document, after a very concrete chain of open/close operations.<br>• Fixed an issue that was making the ESC and ENTER buttons to not work as a standarized form in the New file dialog.<br>• Integrated the new CK-IDE error handler that BLIde users a way to automatically send bug reports including crash logs whenever BLIde crashes. This is automatic (optional) and facilitates users to inform on any BLIde stability issue whenever a crash happens<br>• Fixed an issue that could crash BLIde when a help document was requested in very specific configurations<br>• Fixed an issue that was making the Print routines to make a bad calculation of lines off-set, avoiding some lines of source code when a document was printed on some paper size configurations.<br>• Fixed an important stability issue with the "Replace All" function that could break a managed project internal dependencies refractoring. This has been fixed with the help of Marko Nikolic<br>• Fixed an issue with the BLIde Traveller automatic portable generation code, that could be generating a not MinGW capable version when MinGW was not properly configured in the host machine<br>• Reduced slightly the memory footprint of the source code rendering engine<br>• Fixed an ussue that was making the Project Dependencies Tree window not to follow Windows DPI font scalling for people with accesibility needs.<br>• Fixed a localization issue that was making BLIde show some dialogs in the wrong language<br>• Fixed a serialization issue that was making BLIde serialize some numerals in non-english decimal notation, and this could cause some incompatibilities between BLIde installations.<br>• Fixed an issue that was making the Print Preview dialog to show the wrong icon<br>• Fixed an issue that was making autocompletion box to be case sensitive always, while it should be only on case sensitive languages such as C#, ANSI C, etc.<br>• Fixed an ussue that was making the Solution Explorer window not to follow Windows DPI font scalling for people with accesibility needs.<br>• Added an option to "Close all other tabs" on the right click tabs menu<br>• Added an option to "Close all tabs" on the rick click tabs menu<br>• Improved text rendering speed on the editor window<br>• Some small text parsing improvements from the CK-IDE framework have been implemented on BLIde<br>• Fixed an ussue with the Find&amp;Replace dialog that was causing a major slowdown on complete Find &amp; Replace operations on big files.<br>• A "Replace all" operation is now consuming a single "undo" step<br>• The close button of each document is now placed at each tab, instead of being located at the top right corner. This is cutomizable on the preferences dialog.<br>• Added a context menu on each tabbed document that allows the user to close the document easilly.<br>• Improved the fade in/out effect used to prevent flickering, so it is faster and uses less GDI resources<br>• Fixed an issue that was making the "Jump to definition" not work properly for local variables that had unary operations with the ":" symbol.<br>• Fixed an issue that was making BLIde consider the XOR token as a valid logical operator<br>• Fixed an issue that was making BLIde show folding nodes, after a document reload, when the outlining property was set to False<br>• Modified internal text parser to use new optimized string manipulation system (originally developed for Jungle Ide). Modules parsing is a bit faster now.<br>• BLIde now integrates a new GUI rendering engine that integrates a lot better with current system specific settings<br>Improved parsing speed of big files.<br>• Multithread parsing added to all advanced parsers (BlitzMax, C#, JavaScript, Html, etc.)<br>• Improved all the search and replace internals.

BLIde should now detect it and inform if any permission action is required for the current BlitzMax installation to work properly<br>• Improved internal HTML renderer. Now BLIde will use Internet Explorer 8 or 9 if pressent in the target computer, so it's more secure and faster.<br>• Fixed an issue that could leave a unmanaged solution file (BLIdeUS) in a corrupted state due a permissions issue in the Microsoft implementation of the XML file support.<br>• Fixed an issue that could make BLIde crash after a regular update if some old dlls had been placed in the global assembly cache by the .net NGen utility.<br>• All BLIde .net assemblies are now strong signed.<br>• All BLIde assemblies are now .net 4.0 compatible (but will use .net 2.0 as their default compiler to facilitate portability when it is available).<br>• Reduced memory usage and GDI resources and handles<br>• BLIde engine has been modified to support most of the system accesibility settings.<br>• Fixed a small semaphore multithreading issue that could cause a crash at startup<br>• Bug with removing files from a managed solution when those files had been also removed from disk, from outside BLIde<br>• Language parsing can work on a separated Thread.<br>• Conditional defines evaluation and highlighting for C#/VB/Ansi C parsers.<br>• Bug with GDI resource leak <br>• Bug with word selection when dblclicking on white spaces.<br>• Fixed an issue in the online bug analyzer that could be considering a "Not" prefix in a expression enclosed in parenthesis as a function call, providing false AST information to the syntax analyzer and Autocompletion requester.<br>• Improved the way BLIde handles the debug window on debug sessions. Now, if the window or panel is closed while a debug session is done, BLIde won't bring back the window again unless the user explicitly requests it.<br>• BLIde now allows automatic serialization of Folding states for files that are not part of a Solution.<br>• BLIde should now prevent the tedious CSC.EXE error after the update.<br>• Fixed an issue that was blocking cut&amp;paste operations when an application was being debugged and the advanced settings was set to allow edition while debugging..<br>• Improved thread operations while parsing source code. Now parsing is faster in computers up to 8 cores.<br>• Fixed an issue that was not saving properly single files if they were not modified<br>• Fixed an issue that was triggering the 'Find Next' operation when the F key was pressed and the search and replace dialog was docked.<br>• Fixed a stability issue when loading some large unmanaged solutions and the locals tree was being sorted.<br>• Fixed an issue that was making BLIde integration with the .net printer tools not work properly for some printers, due to some changes introduced in the latest QWhale parser service pack.<br>• BLIde now handles properly the mixture of Linux/MacOs/Windows CR codes that were present in the BlitzMax change-log provided by BRL, so they're properly shown on BLIde.<br>• Fixed a compatibility issue with BLIde and multi-monitor windows setups.<br>• Fixed a stability issue when BLIde is configured to 'open last application' in some very specific configurations<br>• Fixed an issue with the BLIde Traveller creation tool, related to the way MinGW was embedded in the environment<br>• Fixed some drawing artifacts on the cancel button of the "Building..." window.<br>• Fixed an issue that could cause some tools to become hidden when a solution was opened in several computers with different resolutions and screen combinations<br>• Fixed several GDI+ memory leaks<br>• Fixed an issue that was making the option "Explore module's folder" not work properly on BLIde Traveller<br>Improved the time needed to create a BLIde Traveller environment on fast portable drives.<br>• BLIde text renderer is a bit faster due some internal low level improvements.<br>• Improved the autolist-matching mechanism for predictive auto-completion<br>• Jump to definition now can be used also to open and navigate module's source code.<br>• Introduced the BLIde Traveler system. (Tools / Generate a portable environment):<br>• The BLIde Traveler is a portable environment generated from BLIde Plus, that contains all the BLIde IDE, the active BlitzMax installation (including all modules) and the MinGW setup (if any).<br>This environment can be created on a Pen Drive or removable device, and it can be executed later on mostly any Windows computer, without requiring any installation. The whole environment is standalone and can be used directly from the removable device.<br>This tools has been designed to facilitate two tasks:<br>1.- Coding on several computers with the same BLIde and BlitzMax configuration.<br>2.- Betatesting your games or applications on several computers with the ability to fix in-situ any bug that may appear<br>This portable environment called BLIde Traveler is automatically generated by BLIde, and it is ready to be launched from any Windows Vista or Windows 7 computer. It can also be launched on any pre-vista Windows computer with the .net framework version 2,0, 3.0 or 3.5.<br>To generate a BLIde Traveler, just go to Tools / Generate a portable environment, then select the location where you want this portable environment to be generated, and let BLIde do the rest for you. It's easy.<br>• Fixed an issue that could make BLIde become irresponsive for some seconds when loading a solution in some computers.<br>• Fixed an issue that was making BLIde parse wrong some file extensions on the open file dialogs.<br>• Fixed an alignment issue with the Split Edit View button on the Edit window.<br>• Added the option "Explore module's folder" in the Modules menu<br>• String object in intelliprompt is now considered Common in all situations.<br>• BLIde updater now has an option to download any full update package as an offline updater.<br>• BLIde allows the source code to be modified while an application is being run. This is not recommended, but has been added to BLIde due to popular demand.<br>• Some improvements to the JavaScript parser<br>• Fixed a usability problem when BLIde was about to update its internal database to a newer version and the update notification was hidden behind the module's cache window.<br>• BLIde modules database has a much more optimized indexing system, so BLIde is a bit faster in this respect.<br>• Added some new features to the internal BLIde SDK to control wich BLIde edition is a PlugIn running on.<br>• Added support for a new plug-in based intelliprompt system (more info on this very soon). <br>• Cleaned a bit the design of the welcome page.<br>• Removed the BufferedPanel class from the BLIde Plugin SDK. All this functionality is now available in the regular Panel class.<br>• Removed the MinGW compiler class from the BLIde Plugin SDK due it being considered now private and only available in BLIde Plus edition.<br>• Fixed a Stability issue. There was a threading sync issue that could make BLIde not provide any valuable information when a BlitzMax compilation failed.<br>• Fixed a small memory leak in the D3D7 b3d files preview window <br>• Fixed a small threading sync issue introduced in 10.04.10 when the BLIde user was pressing the Cancel button for a Build process.<br>• Fixed an issue that could throw a false 'Out of memory' error while loading unmanaged solutions with a given file's structure.<br>• Added an advanced parameter in the BLIde advanced tab that allows the user to enable or disable the pre-allocation of memory that default .net framework does. Disabling it will reduce the BLIde memory footprint at a cost of slower performance.<br>• Added a feature on the Advanced setting that allows the user to disable the automatic module's updating every X restarts of BLIde.<br>• Added a feature on the Advanced setting that allows the user to define the rate at witch BLIde has to update its internal modules database.<br>• BLIde now removes any query from the debugger pipes once the user cancels the debugging session, so there is no stack-trace queue once the cancel us submitted.<br>• BLIde now redirects all the standard error pipe to the default BLIde console, when a BlitzMax application is being run in release mode.<br>• Added 'Cancel' button to the Building window, so any compilation can be canceled by the user.<br>Added a checkbox to inform whether a toolbar is visible or not, in the View menu.<br>• Toolbar view menu items now work as a toggle.<br>• New simplified splash screen with easier to read text.<br>• Fixed: BLIde was proving intelliprompt suggestion for variable names when the variables where being created in a "For Local" style routine.<br>• Fixed: BLIde could provide an 'Out of memory' message when loading an unmanaged solution under very rare scenarios.<br>• Fixed an issue that was making BLIde throw an unhandled exception when the BLIde start mode was set to 'reopen last' and the last application had been removed from disk.<br>• Fixed a bug in the Search&amp;Replace dialog when a step-by-step replace operation was performed in a text with several replacements in the same line.<br>• Fixed a bug in the internal BLIde BMX lexical parser that was not parsing properly the Else clause of the Assert sentence.<br>• Fixed a bug in the BLIde unmanaged solutions serializer that was using absolute paths to store some project context folders location when the option 'create custom folder' was disabled at the creation of a project.<br>• Added several improvements to the LUA syntactic parser. Thanks to Fabian for providing the improved XML parser source code.<br>• Recent solutions menu now handles a larger list of recent solutions.<br>• Fixed: BLIde was performing code completion for inherited methods and functions, even when the ESC key was pressed to cancel this action.<br> <br></div><br>I'm sure I'm missing something more. Notice that some of the changes listed here are only available on the BLIde Plus version, and not in the free version.<br><br>In order to update a BLIde FREE version to this new iteration, please uninstall ANY previous version from your computer and delete installation folder (if anything remains there). Then, install this version. Your settings muy be kept, but if they do not, or it gives any configuration problems, close BLIde, then remove the BLIde Framework folder from your "Documents" folder, and restart BLIde.<br><br>I've released this update to grant compatibility between BLIde Plus and BLIde Free edition, as there have been some small recent changes on the BLIde unmanged solutions file format and structure.<br><br>All in all... enjoy!<br><br>EDIT: The new version is available for free to everyone here: <a href="http://blide.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=542" target="_blank">http://blide.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=542</a><br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
