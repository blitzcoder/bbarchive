Basically some people's PCs don't run Max games too well when they have background tasks eating up CPU time (they get "catchup" jerks when using delta timing/fixed rate logic).<br><br>So anyway, you can boost the Process Priority Class and/or the Thread Priority.  However, if you boost them too much the combined value can make Windows unstable (according to the docs) and there is a table on MSDN showing you what the combined values are.<br><br>Anyway, I'm going to boost the full-screen mode to a "safe" level as a user who reported jerks has now said it's basically fine.  I'll make another demo at some point soon for wider testing to see if anyone notices anything wierd which could be related to boosting the process and thread to Above Normal.<br><br>My question is, should I boost windowed mode too?  I was thinking of boosting it the same amount for smooth windowed games, or should I assume that the user knows that windows mode won't be as good as full-screen for action games?  I'm not sure the user *will* know this to be honest.  I could put it on the options page, but then they'll never find it and activate it (imho).  Anyway, I've only boosted it a tiny bit, which seems to be good for fighting back against other "hoggy" programs, and Windows still works totally fine on my PC.<br><br>And no my framework is not event driven, it's loop driven and the windowed mode loop has Delay(1) in it.  Oh and windowed mode doesn't use MaxGUI it's just Graphics with some API calls. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Notice how while true wend behaves and eats 100% of your CPU.<br><br>Only way I would see to fix it is to somehow hack the PollInput Module to expose autopoll and set it to false and then call Pollsystem once per frame. it will update all the state variables for your input. <br><br>Hope this helps you find your timing problem but I suspect is systemic to BMAXs attempt to remove the concept of event based model but unfortunatly that is what windows is.<br><br>Doug Stastny <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

However my framework customer tried that and it didn't improve the situation whereas boosting the priority does (the problem is all caused by a Yahoo weather widget, which, when closed, resolves the problem).  Your theory sounded good but didn't work in practice :-(  However, I might add your code anyway just because is cool :-D  Thanks.<br><br>Toby: Well I'm only boosting the priority a tiny bit to a safe level so it won't cause any problems.  As it's part of the framework, my framework users can choose if they want to apply it to their games or not.  I may well add it to mine by default, sorry ;-p but you'll never notice except the game is moreorless guaranteed to run smoothly no matter what else the system is doing.  You might choose to multi-task a game with some MPEG compression going on in the background or something, but most people won't, that's for sure.  Most people have PCs filled with stupid applications and spyware consuming all the resources and I want the game to be able to run well on these systems.<br><br>Question about event-based polling:  OK, fine I can react to events like keys, mouse, window events; I know this stuff well from my Delphi code.  Thing is, say I have constantly moving enemies or scrolling, how can I do that with event-based coding.  Do I have to set up a timer and use that?  My logic runs at 200FPS, so I'd have to set up a 5ms timer and then every time it goes off, check that 5ms has truely passed and use delta time to move stuff an appropriate amount.  If the timer doesn't go off due to a background task hogging resources or something, and say 10ms has passed, will the timer event occur twice in a row quickly (which is why I need to measure time between them) or just once?  I'm a bit of noob with event-based in Max and scrolling etc, any advice is welcome, thanks :-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Although I'm doing much more games programming these days in Blitz. <br><br>Anyway thanks very much for the code snippet, I get how that works, and didn't want to user Timers anyway.  The thing is that isn't the app still consuming 100% CPU time because when PeekEvent is false, the function exits and the main while loop still goes round and round at full speed.  This may defeat the point of letting other threads get their little time slice.  Although I haven't tested it on this other person's PC yet (it will take a bit of integrating).<br><br>In fact I tested it full-screen and in windowed mode and checked out the CPU use in Task Manager (it was 50% in full-screen mode (I have a HT P4) and 20% in windowed mode), then I altered the code so that the main While loop says While not KeyDown(ESCAPE) instead (i.e. no even-based polling) and the CPU use is the same, it doesn't get worse.  So is the event-based stuff giving the OS any more time?  I'm not sure it is...<br><br>When I originally mentioned event-based games, I was imagining the use of WaitEvent so that when no events are happening the game is completely idle and the OS has all the CPU time it wants.  However, I knew that to keep scrolling going an event would need to be generated fairly regularly and a timer might do that, or even a hook to VSync.

This must mean the timer isn't being activated.  In windowed mode though, the CPU use fluctuates a lot more but I wouldn't say it was really any less than your code using PeekEvent, hmm...<br><br>I wonder what BMax does internally with WaitEvent ... is it looping or does Windows handle the waiting?  In theory the WaitEvent with a fast timer for the scrolling etc should be the best option as it leaves max time for the CPU. Although I'm still not clear what happens if the timer missed a few ticks due to lots going on, I guess it would queue several events, which is why using a delta time is important. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Prior to that C++, turbo pascal...way way back.   Now I am Director of R&amp;D for development company so I get to play with different technologies, and make real money .Net and such for buisness apps.<br><br>BMAX is my side fun.<br><br>WaitEvent waits on system mutex for event to window.  Not good idea for games.  The Timer if I remember posts a high resolution event and wakes up the mutex so its should still be running. However no drawing happens since the DirectX context is disabled so all the drawing NOOPS so the loop just spins faster and spends more time in WaitMessage.<br><br>As for PeekEvent<br><br>Yes its still consuming 100% thats not a bad thing.  People have this idea thats bad no its not. its bad when your program doesnt yield.  By calling PeekMessage your are yielding to the OS.  This is where the task switch will then then give any other process with same priority its slice of the CPU pie.  You dont need the delay command for windows apps to try and yield.  calling Peekmessage yields.<br><br>ie.  If you have two programs using 100% like this they will each get 50% as they will usually swap at the PeekMessage.  I say usually as the OS is preemtive so a high priority process like a network driver will still preemt the execution.  For example the task manager.  The UI gets klunky when you dont yield but the OS is still chugging away.  <br><br>Since potential for yield is at PeekEvent which invokes PollSystem by minimizing the number of calls to BMAX commands that call Pollsystem ensures that your app is getting enough CPU.<br><br>I have been playing with DirectX forever and never had the problem on my machine you describe.  Although I dont load a lot of crap on my machine, ie. widgets  Thing is I do run stuff like database servers and such in background and they usually dont seem to interfere, unless a major query kicks in.  But even then my frame rate drops but my program doesnt pause.<br><br>If you could demonstrate a stripped down program without your framework that demonstrates the problem, we might be able to track down the cause.   It might be bad messagepump under the covers or bad handling of a message by BMAX.

This occurs because the timing code detects a large gap has occured in time (say &gt;50ms i.e. more than one frame) and it catches up (due to delta time).  If I don't catch up you get slow downs instead which is rubbish.  Anyway I know it's not my code but outside interference from the OS or other programs (like this widget).  The person with the widget reports my framework is 100% fine when it's not running so it's obvious just adding some extra load.  Also his PC isn't mega fast.  The point is the many end users may have lots of utils and spyware running and my games need to run fine on their PCs.  This person also reports that other Blitz3D and BlitzPlus games run fine making me think that something in Max (or the way I'm using it) is yielding too much to other processes and you may have discovered this (thank ;-))<br><br>Also I haven't installed the Yahoo thing either (I don't want to lol), but I really should for testing to see if the same happens on my PC.<br><br>As for if AAA titles boost the thread I don't know.

Simply because it works in harmony with windows more?

This could be worth considering, but I wonder what is being picked up that could cause a problem?  MaxGUI or something?

Have you had this reported on multiple machines then you have something easier to track down.<br><br>Event based is better because yes it works better with conjunction of the OS.  There are couple of issues with the DX7 driver caused by the default lack of event based processing.  Not to get real technical but the flip mechanism in conjunction with BeginScene and EndScene then yeilding to OS can cause some undesirible behavior with some drivers.  It can be coded around but its messy.<br><br>EVENT_APPTERMINATE will tell you when application is terminated.<br><br>You can use polledinput but you will yield to OS more often and as such have slower performance.<br><br>As for Framework off there is lots of code in BMAX that gets autoinitialized.  Might be something with the network code.  Since the Yahoo widget is checking the network maybe there is some conflict there.<br><br>I can understand how frustrating tracking down pblems like this can be but unless you have a concrete simple example the problem can be anywhere.  <br><br>Im just trying to help as you want to change the priority but really thats not the solution.

I fixed most of the event-based issues last night and have a few more tweaks to make, then I'll run with it as it does sound better.  It's interesting to hear about the DirectX 7 issues, perhaps this is where the problem lies.  I may well investigate the use of Framework too...Plus if I get time I may try to make a mini sample app to test the problem.  Anyway thanks. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
