This may have been started elsewhere but a quick search did not turn anything up.<br><br>It would also be nice if some official  that works at Blitz Research would monitor this thread and indicate which suggestions are going to be implemented and (more importantly) how far down the road they are planned.<br><br>Since I am starting this thread I will make the first suggestion.<br><br>1.  Innate support for audio and video streaming.  I know there are some modules that permit this but I would like to have this feature built into the basic language.  A lot of my programming is multimedia related so this improvement is very important to me.  I remember reading somewhere in one of the forums that this was due to the way the audio part of the language worked (I don't know if this is true though) but even if this means rewritting the entire audio part of the language I think it would be worth it.<br><br>2.  Support for .mp3 audio.  I know this is a copy righted format but with so much music out there in this format it is a weakness for BlitzMax to not support it.  I know I could convert the .mp3 files to .ogg files (which I am currently doing) but this takes time.<br><br>Alright, I've started this thread so others feel free to jump in.<br><br>Jason <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'm not. I am, however, relatively anti-'threading as it's generally known'.<br><br>The main language-side problem with implementing 'normal' multi threading involves the garbage collector. Either the current reference counter would require a 'Lock' on it's increments/decrements (which would add approx 100 cycles to the current 10-ish cycles required for an inc/dec); or, the garbage collector would have to be changed entirely to something like a generational collector, which *would* suffer for collection pauses. The 'prefered usage pattern' for generational collectors does not appear to be 'game friendly' - ie: it hates lots of 'medium life' objects: It ends up having to visit *all* objects quite frequently esp. if you're creating lots of medium life things.<br><br>So, either way, the same single threaded app would run slower in 'multi threaded' Max. I don't think this is something to be taken lightly, and dismissed with the argument that the benefits of multithreading would make up for it. They wont always. Not everything benefits from threading.<br><br>However, that's just the language fix. In addition:<br><br>Lots of stuff in modules would require synchronization primitives added to them. At the very least, BRL.Blitz would require tweaking, and probably anything that hit the OS, as different OS's have different 'rules' about threading. Win32 likes some stuff to only run in the 'main' thread, while Cocoa is 'mostly' threadsafe!<br><br>As for non-OS stuff like TMap, TList, TBank, etc, either synchronization of this lot could be left up to the user, or applied by BRL over a no doubt torturous development period!<br><br>One approach would be just to do the language/BRL.Blitz fix and leave everything up to the user, but the set of *useful* things that would 'just work' on all 3 platforms with this approach is likely to be pretty small. And I suspect that many languages that advertise 'multithreading support' take this approach - ie: synchronize the language core and leave it up to the user to deal with OS-specific issues.<br><br>So I guess to summarize there are 3 options here for implementing normal threading:<br><br>* Make the language/BRL.Blitz thread friendly.<br><br>* Make the language/BRL.Blitz and OS stuff thread friendly.<br><br>* Make everything thread friendly.<br><br>Either way, the same single threaded program will run slower, and threading (beyond printf's on 2 threads!) is still very, very tricky to do *right*!<br><br>(I think my biggest beef with 'normal threading' is this: You basically start out with a 100% unsafe system, and it's up to you to meticulously make it safe.)<br><br>So that's the state of things for normal threading support.<br><br>I would really like to come up with a new approach to threading that eliminates these problems and provides robust threading - and don't forget, I do get to tweak the language if necessary.<br><br>One alternative is process level threading, where each 'thread' has an entirely separate memory space. This is an extremely safe way to do threading - and many of the above issues just don't exist -  but with one major drawback: You can't easily 'share' objects. It's also relatively expensive in terms of OS resources. Reflection would probably make it possible to synchronize objects between processes but with some overhead.<br><br>I guess providing some kind of IPC would at least be a safe, simple way to get a kind of threading happening - be a good excuse to implement QNX IPC again!<br><br>Trolltech are also about to release a very interesting approach called qtconcurrent or something. This basically parallelizes things very much the same way a GPU does - ie: does the same operation multiple times. But it's done in a completely safe way, in that there are no synchronization primitives to worry about.<br><br>This is where I'd be interested in looking at how the language could perhaps be changed to support threading - perhaps by marking a method as 'Parallel' which limits what it can do (eg: can't write globals - can't call non-parallel methods etc) so that it can safely run in parallel. Then, "For EachIn actors Run Update()' or something...<br><br>A combination of this with process level threading to handle the 'big' jobs (eg: update/render/physics) is, to me anyway, a far more appealing and interesting way to go than normal threading!<br><br>But yes, it's all pretty experimental.... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I may be placing too much faith in programmers, but it's my belief that people will not automagically assume that using threading is going to benefit them.  Some degree of research would have to be invested by anyone wanting to use it, obviously.  I don't think there's any good way to make threading friendly to people, it's just something you have to bite the bullet on in a lot of cases.<br><br>So, my ideal choice would be the first option.  The second would probably be more of a bonus than anything else, and the third is going a bit far when a lot of BMax's existing modules simply wouldn't need thread-safety since I can't imagine anyone using, say, Max2D and just the regular modules to make a small game or application would be interested in using threading.  It wouldn't benefit them in any way to be frank.  With something like I'm doing, a full-blown engine, there can be benefits, especially for a client/server design similar to a lot of engines now (e.g., Source).<br><br>Now, this:<div class="quote"> One alternative is process level threading, where each 'thread' has an entirely separate memory space. This is an extremely safe way to do threading - and many of the above issues just don't exist - but with one major drawback: You can't easily 'share' objects. It's also relatively expensive in terms of OS resources. Reflection would probably make it possible to synchronize objects between processes but with some overhead. <br></div>I believe this is what Valve (Half-life guys) are using in their engine to minimize the amount of trouble encountered with threading.  Somewhere, there's a bunch of slides where they go over their threading solution and from what I remember, they synchronize global data between threads by means of a queue.  Before a thread uses the global data, it checks for a new version and replaces the old data with the new before going ahead and uses its own copy of the data.<br><br>It will consume more memory, this goes without saying, but these days I don't think that's as much of an issue.  Most machines these days should have more than enough to accommodate this solution, especially considering if you were to put this into use, it likely wouldn't be on an old P2 with 128mb of RAM (I probably have my specs for old machines mixed up- might be 64mb).  In the event that someone doesn't use threading, then this wouldn't be an issue and memory usage would be relatively normal- at least within the bounds of regular indie games (since that seems to be what most people here are doing), even if it might not be as little as possible (but then if you were trying for that, you'd be using C/C++).<br><br><div class="quote"> A combination of this with process level threading to handle the 'big' jobs (eg: update/render/physics) is, to me anyway, a far more appealing and interesting way to go than normal threading! <br></div>More or less my opinion on it.  Using threading for small tasks, things that just wouldn't ever see a potential benefit from it, is pointless as far as I'm concerned.  Sure, it's neat when you start, but that's not why you'd really use threads.<br><br>I'll see if I can find Valve's slides.  It had to do specifically with multi-core systems, but it's still relevant if I'm not mistaken. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So many more computers now are coming out with multiple cores and/or CPU's as standard and if Blitz isn't taking advantage of that increasing trend it's going to be left behind. Imagine I have a computer which has a combined CPU-core rate of 4GHz, but everything you write for it in BlitzMax only runs at half speed, and then Blitz gets a reputation for being twice as slow as other software, that's not a good thing.<br><br>I think I would prefer threads over processes although I think both really should be implemented with more control possible. Naturally a process is in an isolated memory space but this of course means pieces of your software are isolated from each other and sharing is optional - and there is very little in the way of easy sharing currently available. On the other hand threads at least start out by assuming that everything is shared and then leaves it up to you to implement safety *where you need it* as an option.<br><br>I think if you start out with processes and you try to turn an essentially isolation-based system into a way to share parts of software, you're going to have to be asking the programmer to deliberately define every `open door` between any two parts of their application. I think it would be far more natural and easy to simply have all the doors open right from the off and then put into place options to shield parts of the system as needed. Then because it's on an as-needed basis you aren't forced to be confined. It is more natural to start with openness and to close off the parts which are are at risk, than to start with a totally closed system and to try to open it up.<br><br>Also threads are meant to be more efficient than processes with less overhead and processing requirements. Taking a step backwards and trying to make processes act like threads should seems like the wrong direction.<br><br>Maybe instead of needing to implement a lock for the garbage collector you can simply implement more than one counter per object and then just add the counters together when it comes time to check them. Assign each counter to a given thread and let it modify only that counter. Then when thread A is modifying its counter and thread B comes along and modifies its counter for the same object, which who knows could make one counter be 1 and the other -1, adding them together will take care of the multiple dereferencing. Of course that would mean more memory space for keeping the counters and maybe you'd have to limit how many threads can access an object at the same time, but hey even if it could only do 2 or 4 threads that would be worth it.<br><br>However you do it, I think you should start with threads which give you efficiency and flexibility and then build in `helper options` to make things safe which need to be. You could have a SuperSafe mode to be used by newbies which locks down a lot of stuff, a Safe mode for the average user, and then a Generic or Raw mode which requires the programmer to define on a more per-object or per-function type of basic which pieces of code are assigned to what threads, create their own threads, manage them, set up their own program structure, etc.<br><br>If for example I know that I want to provide support for up to 2 or 4 threads - given that 2 or 4 core cpu's are popular, (and we need to support simultaneous multiprocessing too,) then I should be able to specify some kind of compiler directive to say to compile for that kind of `target` hardware and then specify which areas of code I want to assign to a given core number by default, and then have dynamic thread allocation in the language, and hey presto.<br><br>The only part I think is BRL's job is making the garbage collector work efficiently and potentially safely (if desired by programmer), making sure BlitzMax's lower level stuff is internally thread safe like o/s calls etc, and then provide language/compiler features to give a nice useful flexible and powerful API to the programmer. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The whole point (ie. advantage) of multi threading is that the two threads share the same memory pool, and thus the same data, so you don't waste precious resources copying, maintaining and synchronizing data between "instances". While using processes eliminates the concurrent access problem, it introduces a redundant data problem instead, as there still isn't a mechanism to ensure that data is only modified at a single discrete point in time. Imagine a video game server if you will. Lets say you spawn one process/thread for each player who joins. For a process based model, this means you need to keep one copy of every object in the game in every process, and manually keep them synchronized, whenever data changes, and pray that a race condition never occurs. For a threaded model you just need one copy in memory and a mechanism (a problem clever people have figured out how to solve 100 times over - use a monitor) to prevent races and concurrent access, you do not need to keep the data synchronized, because there is no redundant data.<br><br><div class="quote"> If somebody is willing to pay for a sabbatical year to do this, I volunteer. <br></div>How much? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
