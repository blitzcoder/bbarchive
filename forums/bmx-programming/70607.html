By "huge", I mean up to several megs at a time, compounded every time a new map is loaded or a map is reloaded. I tried very hard to track down the problems in the map engines, but I ran out of steam.<br><br>Has anyone else had this problem with BlitzMax map engines? Did you solve it? Is there a big enough community demand for a third-party map engine for any of the major map editors that it would be worth my time to develop one?<br><br>SpaceAce <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Really, it's my favorite of the BlitzMax-ready map editors, with an excellent collision-bit/meta-data system and a nice map engine (except for the memory leak), but the developers seem to have abandoned it halfway through and just don't seem very interested in it. It wasn't until I bought a copy that I started running into the bugs. I made a <b>very</b> detailed post on their old forums with sample files, screenshots and in-depth descriptions of the problems I was having and the guys there said they would look into it, then, a few days later, they took the site down for redesign and apparently didn't bother to save anything from the old forums.<br><br>SpaceAce <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I just feel discouraged because I spent quite a few hours documenting, experimenting, taking screen shots, trying variations on the actions that caused the bugs, etc, to narrow the bugs down as far as possible. I just don't feel like doing that all over.<br>  Actually, even as I type this, I have binphx.mapengine open in BLIde as I try to track down the memory leak (seems to be in ResizeNoSave), so I may have useful information soon.<br><br>Dreamora,<br>  I mentioned Universal Map Editor (UME) in my initial post. UME is a great program in a lot of ways, but it had some flaws that really annoyed me. Also, the BlitzMax engine for Universal Map Editor also has a major memory leak and it is missing some important functionality. I don't remember what all the map engine was missing, but it was one of the main reasons I moved on to other editors instead of purchasing the Pro version.<br><br>Edit: Nevermind, it isn't in ResizeNoSave; I forgot your sample has GCcollect on manual. I knew ResizeNoSave wasn't where I tracked it down to last time :/<br><br>SpaceAce <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
