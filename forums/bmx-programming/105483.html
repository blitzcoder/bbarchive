You'd think he was a 12 year old.<br><br>The issue is no longer the initial behavior, it's his taking issue with being called on the initial behavior.  His attitude that the stars (and his attitude) would be tolerated on other programming forums is frankly absurd, people elsewhere just don't have any tolerance whatsoever.<br><br>Frankly I think *that* is aspie, as programmers tend to be.  Our harping on something as minor as stars in the topic is also aspie/OCD but it is what it is and when a bunch of people tell you some behavior is annoying them, you don't argue about it, you just change the behavior and forget about it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Thanks for the vote of confidence. I won't be using asterisks. It does remind me a little of the classic 1984 where 2 + 2 = 5. As the story goes, it is an example of an obviously false dogma one may be required to believe, similar to other obviously false slogans by the Party.<br><br>It is contrasted with the phrase "two plus two makes four", the obvious (by definition) – but politically inexpedient – truth. Orwell's protagonist, Winston Smith, uses the phrase to wonder if the State might declare "two plus two equals five" as a fact; he ponders whether, if everybody believes it, does that make it true ?<br><br>It's an interesting point, and one I felt was thrust upon me when there was a sudden and very curious 'dislike' by EVERYONE against the perpetrating asterisk symbol. I feel at that point I had to 'tell' others 2 + 2 does in fact, make 5. And, for a moment - I did, and perhaps I did see 5 lights, as Jean Luc Picard might tell you.<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_Command_%28Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation%29<br><br>I removed all the asterisks. And I HOPE that will be the end of it. I suspect many people were not so much interested in 'maintaining' order as it was fun to kick someone when they are down.<br><br>That is the technique where you stand behind existing laws to hurt someone and no-one dares question the prosecutor because they are only 'upholding' the law.<br><br>Darker still there is also the method of fabricating laws, made up on the spot for the sole purpose of prosecuting innocent bystanders. Talking loud and important and downplaying someone for the 'crime' they've committed.<br><br>Did that take place here ? I'll let you decide that.<br><br>Some other 'reasons' not to like me are the fact I have written some very simple solutions to what other helpers have gone WAY out on a limb in their massive coding to solve - when in fact simplicity and mere common sense will do.<br><br>Enough to tee off any good programmer, except the very easy-going and laid-back surely. Heap on the criticism, especially when it's not thought all the way through. *Grin*<br><br>I play and write piano music. I remember playing one of my pieces at college in one of the study rooms for a friend. I mentioned I didn't like the middle of it. Could he help me with a few notes on it ?<br><br>He sat down, note for note repeated exactly what he heard only once and then FINISHED my piece, my original and heart felt piece of music - and it was lovely. It was beautiful. It was so wonderful ... I wanted to kill him I hated him so much right then. :)<br><br>So I will continue and try to be helpful, however. Understand I might see things from a different perspective, I might program differently than most. But I =DO= answer the problem and question - when I can, and usually the easiest way I can as I'm not one for massive keystrokes whenever possible in my programming.<br><br>Hopefully in time the favor might be returned should I get confused or ask questions about a puzzling issue in programming. And hopefully it will be with source code example. To me the true equalizer in the field of learning machine code - of any language.<br><br>Only time will tell.<br><br>Apologies for the wordsworthy. I also write books and have done computer tutoring at colleges years ago. So I can be a little specific on things. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
