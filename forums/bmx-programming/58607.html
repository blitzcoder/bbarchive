Supports Boned animation, texture shadows, Stencil shadows, environmental mapping, bump mapping, cel shading, full screen post fx compositors, bloom, depth of field,glass shaders, material scripts, post fx scripts.Full very powerful skinnable gui that runs in both in windowed and full screen mode. Very easy to use MaxGui like design with events and callback support.<br> Full support for Cg, HLSL and GLSL. Drivers for DirectX9 and OpenGL drivers. Full integration with ofusion 3d max pipeline for a truely next generation wysiwyg art pipeline. Full lua bindings and lua script engine to fully embed scripts into your applications with the full power of Aurora at your disposal. Full networking solution powered by the commercial BlitzNet Optica. Avi file support powered by MaxAVI. Two Physics solutions, Newton and Ode. Newton supports Convex hulls, prefabbed geo and full collision feedback. JV-Ode Bindings for jv-ode max owners to fully integrate ode into the engine. Camera Picks, Linepicks fully integrated into the newton physic engine. Debug view. View phyics. Free E-mail Technical support at no extra cost. Free updates for the life of the product. Mac/Linux versions to be released at a later date.

Blitz3D is and engine... DarkBASIC is and engine... BMax is anEngine, TV3D is an engine.. and so on...<br><br>but, really now... what is an engine... stop and think... in it's generic definition, an engine is something that you can turn on, and it does something when you press the throttle (or whatever)...<br><br>applying this simplified definition to game 'engines'... this is exactly why i see that none of the above mentioned as being any sort of engines at all... they can't be turned on... they can't do anything... as they are, they offer functional alternatives to an more complex and work intensive set of apis... <br><br>the only ones i've worked with so far, that i see as being actual game 'engines', are Torque and irrlicht (rendering engine)...<br><br>... and, accept it or not, you code examples above seem to indicate that Aurora is not in the same ball park as either... Aurora does appear to be more of a lib of functions, or a wrapper.<br><br>now this does not denegrate Aurora, or is not meant to bring it down at all... i think it will be a great tool for BMax... <br><br>take a look at the main game loop from your code examples above, then look at  the main loop from the simple irrlicht hello world example...<br><br><pre class=code>

</pre><br>can you see here the 'engine'  here... the irrlicht device is the engine, and albeit, while it's only a rendering engine, it does quite a bit of work managing the components that are coded in and now are part of the engine by  the developer... it's a true engine...<br><br>once the irrlicht device is 'turned on',  it is running... <br><br>there is no Aurora device to turn on... Aurora doesn't appear to manage any aspect of the game code... in fact, the coder has to write whatever 'engine'  he/she needs,  using the Aurora functions and datatypes provided...<br><br>i'm assuming that OGRE is doing something under all this, but i don't know enough about OGRE to comment on it...<br><br>if Aurora were a game, and it exposed functionality for extending itself and modifying itself,  then it would be more correctly termed an engine... at least that's how i see things...<br><br>correct me if i am wrong here... i'm by no means an expert on this sorta stuff... but at the very least lets take it easy on each other...<br><br>but what we have here is a good thing...

You can make games with it, a lot of the core functionality is there. Input, transforms, simple timing limiting code, physics, raycasting, pics, Limited Gui and hud stuff, Collisions and physics, Sound via Bmax etc etc. most of the entity creation is there and so you can definately make simple games. Untested LUA?. Simple networking that has been tested only briefly definately suitable for simple MP, but not been pushed very hard.<br><br>Ogre3D takes care of all the areas that ant's old engines failed at, and its way more mature than any of his previous attempts. It also has very solid art pipelines, with 3dsmax support being the best I have seen anywhere, puts B3D pipeline to shame.<br><br>I'd say it is an engine, but one that requires a lot of support, and not hit the last 20% it hasn't been tested extensively and isn't going to cover all bases with only about 2 weeks of simple demo's, and what you saw in the video for FMC. It's definately capable of simple games, and demos. But it's going to need feedback and proper support from before I'd call it finished engine. He has made a good start though, and it is useable in its current state.<br><br>You can control much of it with regular bmax language, so its a lot like blitz3D. So your going to have to code a lot of things yourself, like AI etc. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you want to make a game with a decent render engine there isn't much to choose from thats Bmax friendly and has a good art path. Ogre3D is getting a non LGPL console license too :), which is something that offers hope for prople wanting to get onto 360 or PS3 later. Not that the wrapper is going to help much there. <br><br>There's alreadt Ogredotnet, when C# gets more libraries that are useful for gamers (quite likely with the C# based 360 SDK).

I've been making my game 3D engine independant as much as I can because of this continual problem.  That way when the engine is no longer supported, then moving to another engine is not too painful.<br><br>The people releasing these wrappers need to understand that if a person is going to hang a game off their wrap then continued development/support for the working life of the engine is a necessity,  particularly when the cash is on the table.  It's this continued development/support that I'm looking for when I pay the cash, not the initial wrap.  When it gets pin droppingly quiet for a month or 2 shortly after the initial release then it doesn't inspire my confidence in doing any form of long term work with the engine. <br><br>Also, initial engine sales are normally people just testing the water.  You will attract more sales by continued development of the engine over the long term.  This is because the new buyers will be feeling confident in the engine's future.<br><br>The future of ColdSteel, gmans irrlicht wrap and Eliza seem pretty safe at the moment.

I'm looking forward to trying it, I was just basing my response on my own personal experience of tv. it wasn't good. I've found Ogre to be a much more flexible easy to use environment. Mainly becauses its like b3d in a lot of ways <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But in the same way that Hambone made comments about Ogre ( the engine underlying your wrapper ) you made comments about TV3D ( the engine underlying my wrapper ) and - aside from being misleading and in a couple of cases, incorrect - it reflects on my hard work in the same as it reflects on your hard work.<br><br>You clearly didn't appreciate what Hambone had to say about TV3D vs Ogre, so I'm sure if you sit and think about it for a few, you can see why I didn't like what you had to say about Ogre vs TV3D.<br><br>I don't have a problem as we stand, I'm just asking you to remember that I put a lot of work into my wrapper, exactly as you did into yours. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

And I'm used to using max as a level editor. Your used to using tools like UUnwrap and didn't seem to get on with B3D pipeline either. Just depends on what tools and how your used to working. I've mostly worked with max as a level editor since 1999 on commercial games, and find it second nature to work that way.<br><br>So far I havent had any serious problems with ofusion, just the kinds of little glitched you expect with beta software.<br><br>I'd have been interested in TV3D if there was something out there to prove it was any good without putting money up front and purchacing it without testing it first. Allways on the lookout for something thats both nice for coders and artists and keeps everyone happy. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
