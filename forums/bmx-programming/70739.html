I did (of course) encounter the bugs you mention but everything seems to be nice and snappy. <br><br>I did have a few feature requests... <br><br>It would be really cool to have a window that displays the expanded node of your current 'local shortcuts' for the currently open code file. Right now if you're editing more than one file its a bit cumbersome to expand all of that info, since you have to scroll up and down to open new files.<br><br>Secondly, it would be great to have a 'lock' mode, like the windows 'lock the taskbar' thing, that will disable moving windows around, changing settings etc. I often mess up the alignment of the toolbar or move the console or local shortcuts by accident.<br><br>Not sure how important these are in the scheme of things, but they'd be very nice to have. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Also, if BLIde locks windows, it has to be possible to open windows without having to 'unlock' and then 'lock again'. As an example, if I have the console closed, and run an application that performs an Input, the console has to be automatically opened to let the user enter information, if not, the application would be locked waiting for user response... I need to take a deep look to this, and find a practical way to develop it without loosing functionality. but, obviously, I will implement it. It is a very good Idea. Maybe the lock feature coud be addresed by disabling panels floatability? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Also, it would be good if it scrolled the window down automatically to center the newly selected code file so all of its functions etc are on screen (although I think this is less important).<br><br>That's a good point about the locked windows stuff... I guess the answer is that if blide needs to open up the window internally, then it would act just as it does now or as it would in unlocked mode, it is only the user moving the windows around that will be ignored.<br><br>By settings I meant misc stuff like rearranging the menu toolbars or closing the console or another view window accidentally. Maybe I'm just really clumsy but it happens every time I use the editor and it's frustrating setting things back the way they were again.<br><br>Thanks for looking into them! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There is also an 'auto hide all windows' mechanism.<br><br>9.- The preferences dialog is working again, with the new parser<br><br>10.- Also the default welcome page has been redesigned to a more simple and IMHO better looking way. It also loads the news channel a lot faster making all the website access and download in a separated thread to 'fake' it is instant.<br><br>11.- There has been also a major update on the wizards, updating the wizard control to a new underlaying system that (in further versions) will conform the Vista Wizard specification. Now BLIde conforms the Wizard 97 specification by Microsoft. Also, all the drawings in the wizard control, have been updated to work with the GDI+ architecture, so they look a little better.<br> <br></div><br><b>IMPORTANT NOTE TO BLIDE PLUS USERS</b>:<br>This version has a new security system for the BLIde Plus recognition and activation, so any BLIde Plus user that wish to test the BLIde Plus features in this beta, will have to send an email to get a new speciffic activation username and password for version 0.9.x.<br><br>You can download this beta version here: <a href="http://www.blide.org/blide-0-9-1-beta.rar" target="_blank">http://www.blide.org/blide-0-9-1-beta.rar</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
