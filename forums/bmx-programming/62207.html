That means a pointer to a pointer to a BBObject struct or (in C) "typedef BBObject** bbObjectPtrType". (BBObject defined in "mod/brl.mod/blitz.mod/blitz_object.h")<br><br>I thought this data type was allowed in any version before; but why isn't it allowed still?<br>Because the GC behaviour has changed?<br>I think if everyone is using this type carefully there will be no problems when using "Object Ptr" data type with the GC.<br><br>Here's an example which would run correctly with the GC if "Object Ptr" data type would be allowed:<pre class=code>Strict
Framework brl.blitz

Local O:Object = New T'creates a new object, blitzmax GC cares about the object referenced by O
Local P:Object Ptr = Varptr O'get the address of the variable in memory, the GC doesn't care about variables of type "? Ptr"
DoAnything P'call a function; while this function is executed the variable O is still in scope and the object has at least 1 reference
'now the function has ended; but the object's reference counter still counts 1 reference: the main programme's variable O
'Go on with the main programme;the object can still be accessed by O and P[0]
P = Null
'now the object can only be accessed by O; but the reference counter stays at the prev. value (1 reference: O)
O = Null'this causes the objects reference counter to decrement: so there's no reference and the object will be deleted soon
'Go on with the code

Function DoAnything ( P:Object Ptr )
  Local O:Object = P [ 0 ]'set a new variable O to this object; now it has 2 references: the main programme's O and the sub programme's O
  'Do anything with the object; all the time this code runs the object has at least these 2 references
EndFunction'now the function ends; this causes the sub programme's variable O to run out of scope, so the object's reference counter decrements

Type T
EndType</pre><br><br>So please, if anyone knows, tell me why is this type not allowed in this version; and: will it be re-allowed in any future version? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Therefore, 'Object Ptr' (or ' Ptr' etc) is no longer accepted. This is because there is not any safe way to write to such a pointer without massively confusing garbage collection/detection. It is still legal to convert an object reference to a 'Byte Ptr', but you should be aware the pointer will only be valid while the object remains 'in scope'.<br>... <br></div> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I don't think defining these things as not allowed will help to prevent GC confusing. If anyone wants to confuse the GC this person will always find a way to do so. For example getting a objects variable address can be done like this:<div class="quote"> varptr.bmx:<pre class=code>Strict
Framework brl.blitz

Import brl.standardio

Import "varptr.s"

Local I'this variable is just to show that the returned value is right
Local O:Object = New T
Print Int Varptr I'this variable is just 4 bytes above on the stack
Print Int _Varptr ( O )'you can see a difference of 4 bytes

Type T
EndType

Extern
  Function _Varptr:Byte Ptr ( O:Object Var )
EndExtern</pre>varptr.s:<pre class=code>format MS COFF
public __Varptr
__Varptr:
mov eax,dword [esp+4]
ret</pre> <br></div>There's always such a dirty way to trick the BlitzMax compiling and GC rules.<br><b>But I don't want to use that way.</b><br>It would be better to re-allow the Object Ptr and then set an explicit warning into the docs that Varptr + an object's variable will not return a pointer to the object and that the person using this feature has to make sure that pointer's to object variable's are only accessed when the object variable stay's valid.<br><br>It isn't very difficult to implement the Object Ptr type and it wouldn't slow down the programme, it wouldn't decrease the functionality of existing features, but it would provide a full downwardly compatibility (to all applications: the ones before and after 1.18).<br>You see: there are only advantages, no disadvantages <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I know at least 1 workaround but won't post it as it breaks RefCount and GC quite easily if used by unexperienced user. But to give you a hint on how: memcpy is your friend if you use your target typeinstances varptr and the byte ptr as well as sizeof(type) ...)<br><br><br>btw: And your modules aren't compatible to before 1.16/ 1.18 anyway, no mather if Object Ptr is broken again or not, as the module format has changed with both and everything compiled after is broken anyway to those.
