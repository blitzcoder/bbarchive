The framework I'm currently working on is structured in such a way that I don't have to go to the main loop every time and add another for loop to update that type. Saves on maintenance and adds to flexibility. Below is a very simplified version of what I'm talking about:<br><br><br>the only actual 'executing' code:<br><pre class=code>
Local game:TGame = New TGame
game.Init()
game.Update()
</pre><br><br>This is the main game class. In fact, it's the _only_ true 'global' in my games. Anything I need to access I go through the global of this class. Init() just adds some characters to the game.<br><pre class=code>
rem
bbdoc: basic game class
end rem
Type TGame
	Field database:TObjectDatabase = Null
	
	Method Init()
		database = New TObjectDatabase
		database.AddObject(New TCharacter)
		database.AddObject(New TCharacter)
	End Method
	
	Method Update()
		database.Update()
	End Method
End Type
</pre><br><br><br>this is a generic container class that holds all game objects:<br><pre class=code>
rem
bbdoc: simple collection class.
end rem
Type TObjectDatabase
	Field _objects:TList = CreateList()
	
	Method AddObject(gameObj:TGameObject)
		_objects.AddLast(gameObj)
	End Method
	
	Method Update()
		For Local obj:TGameObject = EachIn _objects
			obj.Update()
		Next
	End Method
End Type
</pre><br><br>Any object that needs to be 'updated' extends the very basic TGameObject class:<br><pre class=code>
rem
bbdoc: a very thin game object class that provides update() functionality
end rem
Type TGameObject Abstract
	
	Method Update() Abstract
		
End Type
</pre><br><br>A sample implementation of TGameObject:<br><pre class=code>
rem
bbdoc: a game object that implements TGameObject's update() method
end rem
Type TCharacter Extends TGameObject

	Method Update()
		' w0o!
		Print "updating character!"
	End Method
	
End Type
</pre><br><br>Slightly more complex than a basic global list and an updateAll() function for each type. In reality, there's a lot more that goes into it, but to get started this works just fine. But what does it buy you? Well, once you've coded these classes you _rarely_ need to go and modify your main game update() loop every time you introduce a new type of object. Anyway, that's my two cents. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In a way, a "a character collection" is one "database". So, I think this depends on the problem. <br><br>I'm also having one file per class, but I'd rather have certain clear modules that would not have dependancies in each other. For example, in your approach "character object" needs to extend game object. I don't want that :) - but for your framework it might be ideal since I believe your framework is one "closed box".<br><br>I think the characterCollection approach works best <i>in my situation</i>, although I keep in mind what many of you have said: different situations might require different approach, so even though I use collection here, I might end up using singleton somewhere and even those "loops inside classes" that Grey Alien mentions somewhere else.<br><br>Thanks everybody, this has been very helpful. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

As I pointed out earlier in this post, the interdependency of classes can become a real problem if you do not have /very/ strict control and insight into where the global stuff is created and when and who/what needs access to it. This can become a real headache at times. When it does, It is usually time to rethink your strategy and code design.<br><br>At least with keeping all the global stuff in a single static 'Global' class, you at least have strict control over what gets created/destroyed  in which order. That does require you to know the rest of the code though, as cyclic references are easily made this way.<br><br>My Global class ensures this by being the very first and the very last class to be called in my programs.. It has a static Initialize() and a static Dispose() Function which take care of the ordered creation/destruction of the global objects.<br><br>Global.Initialize();<br>'//  Entire Program goes here<br>Global.Dispose(); <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
