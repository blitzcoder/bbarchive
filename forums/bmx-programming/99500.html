&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f

</pre><br><br>This does the following: if you reference a thing within a "files"-directory and it is missing (or no file), the "files.php"-script is run (and given params are set).<br>You may call this "mixing virtual and real directories".<br><br>If you store a "readme.txt" within<br>"mydomain.tld/files/" you can access it with<br>"mydomain.tld/files/readme.txt" and it is displayed without script usage.<br><br>now imagine you store the readme.txt within<br>"mydomain.tld/_mysecret_files" (or outside of htdocs - so it is not reachable from outside)<br>if a user now tries to call:<br>"mydomain.tld/files/readme.txt" <br>the script<br>"mydomain.tld/files.php?fromDir=files/readme.txt" <br>is called.<br><br>within files.php you could then do the methods I explained at the start of my posting.<br>Eg.<br><br><pre class=code>
$requestedFilePath = rawurldecode( isset($_GET["fromDir"]) ?  $_GET["fromDir"] : "" );
//remove "files/" from param - they are fake
$requestedFilePath = str_replace('files/', '', $requestedFilePath);
//... your other file checks to avoid /../../etc/passwd and other things
// -&gt; easiest is to have only level1 subdirectories (not files/myA/myB/myC/file.zip)
//so you can do:
$requestedFilePath = explode("/", $requestedFilePath);
//subdir given?
if(count($requestedFilePath)&gt;0) {
  //validate directory
  $validExtraChars = array('-', '_'); 
  if(!ctype_alnum(str_replace($validExtraChars, '', $requestedFilePath[0]))) { 
    die('illegal characters found in file request'); 
  }
  //assign file
  $requestedFile = $requestedFilePath[1];
  $requestedFilePath = $requestedFilePath[0];
}else{
  //assign file
  $requestedFile = $requestedFilePath[0];
  $requestedFilePath = '';
}

//check filename for invalid characters
if(!preg_match('/^(?:[a-z0-9_-]|\.(?!\.))+$/iD', $requestedFile)) {
   die('illegal characters found in file request'); 
}

//proceed with your file
//add "/" to path if one is given
$requestedFilePath = ($requestedFilePath&lt;&gt;""?$requestedFilePath."/":"");

//script variables
$myHomeDir = "/users/ziggy/htdocs/_mysecretfilesdir" //absolute path

//respond if file not existing
if(!file_exists($myHomeDir."/".$requestedFilePath.$requestedFile))
  die("file not found.");

//process your file here
//eg. redirect to the processed file
//or copy it ( copy(old,new) )

This is below your minimum specifications so I am unsure whether to bother downloading and trying again.<br><br>6 Months is shorter than the development time of a single product, and 75 Euro is exactly 75 Euro more than I've ever spent on an IDE before which makes me feel uncomfortable.  I would want to know that my purchase would cover me at least until I have completed 1 project.  My current is one year of planning, prep and experimentation in and a further month of actual dev so far, for about 10% final complete.  I'd say I was at least 6 months away from finishing, and possibly more.<br><br>SVN integration is not listed as a feature, and neither is Git (although I use SVN for historical reasons), which makes me question whether actually paying for an IDE is going to give me something more than free ones.  I don't know how anyone works without some form of VC and most free IDE have some kind of VC built in (eg Netbeans) or as a plugin (eg Sublime/Eclipse).  This is absolute minimum requirement to be an IDE (personal view).<br><br>3D preview doesnt support enough formats, I do use b3d, but also fbx and ocassionally 3ds.  Only X and B3D are listed.  Whilst this lack of support doesnt in itself bother me, it adds to my questioning of the completeness of the product and level of developer activity, fbx is hardly new and it is an emerging standard. <br><br>For a long time until I looked at IDE's more closely a couple of months ago I assumed it was for Blitz Plus because it's named wrong :P<br><br>Anyway, I thought that might help a little.  At the moment i'm still on the fence over sorting out the IDE issue, i'm using the community edition for my current project whilst wondering whether to even stay with Blitz for my next one - I'm disillusioned more by the debugging in multi-threaded apps and have found issues in all the 3rd party 3D engines I've tried so I would like an engine with a company behind it rather than an individual.  And neither of these really relate to the IDE. :)<br><br>Happy new year. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But you should not worry as current license is lifetime. There are no 6 months updates licenses any more. That said, if I ever were to add any version control system to BLIde, it would be Mercurial instead of SVN or Github, as I really don't like SVN and I have to confess I'm a bit of a Mercurial fan boy. That's what I like using. Anyway, this is not happening anytime soon, so if you want an IDE with an integrated version control system, you can write your own BLIde Plugin (BLIde has a very powerful SDK) or just find something else.<br><br>That said, those are BLIde minimum system specs: <a href="http://www.blide.org/?p=158" target="_blank">http://www.blide.org/?p=158</a> I don't know where did you get than a i5 was under minimum specs, it's way over them.<br><br>Being honest, why do you need a VC system on an IDE when you're using Tortoise? I would understand it if you were using the command line tools only, but using tortoise I can't see a single reason to have a plugin for it on a IDE (I'm being 100% in this question, I really don't get it). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I've been spoilt :P<br><br>I use BlitzMax for fun and for making games which is my hobby, but a little over 5 years ago my dreams became reality when I became a professional developer, and now i'm even "Head of Development" which is all kinds of dream job cool...<br><br>Although I do occasionally use Blitz for professional purposes I mostly work in php, databases, javascript and ye olde html+css.  For this I use a variety of editors depending upon my mood, the project, and whether a crow flies west at 3pm on a Sunday.<br><br>For web development they're all free, and they all have integrated version control except the crudest ones (Notepad++ and Pspad for instance), and what a revolution it is to have!  Especially for a coder like me who uses multiple wide screens and still doesn't have enough window space to display everything!<br><br>It's annoying hitting the desktop button and shrinking all those windows, and often I've multiple explorer windows open.  Having the version control integrated into the file explorer which is onscreen anyway just makes so much sense, it's a small annoyance not to have it, but it irks me every time I use an editor without one that I've got to fiddle about.<br><br>I hate fiddling.  I like things that just work.  Committing to SVN can occur multiple times an hour, and at least several times a day.  So that little irk just builds and builds into a "grr".  And once something becomes a "grr", you start checking the feature list before you try a new IDE to make sure it's got the things you want.<br><br>Everyone is different, for me, I like my VC built into the IDE. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
