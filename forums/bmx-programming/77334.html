It would actually take more of an effort to do it any other way. What would you be comparing the other pixels in the larger image to exactly? This means that when checking a 32x32 image against a 1024x768, only a 32x32 section of the larger image is checked. Since it (probley) already does this, it's faster than grabbing a 32x32 image yourself. (Which will be slow... this could probley be sped up, but not keeping bmax at the opengl level it's at.)<br>2) When the calculations are done to figure out what part of each image is compared, this automatically guarantees some things. If the two images don't collide at all (based on position, and size, not on actual pixel data), then there aren't any actual pixel vs pixel checks. If only a small area say 5x5 pixels overlap, then only that is checked. What this means is that the function -could- take longer if more of the images overlap. Now, on your tests, you compared times with the function checking a 32x32 image against another 32x32 image, and a 32x32 image against a 1024x768 image. Now, do the two 32x32 images always have the same position? If not, it's not a fair comparison, since I'm willing to bet that in the second case (32x32 vs 1024x768), they always overlap 100%. What this means is that the first test may return with 0 actual pixels checked (won't even have to worry about actual image data), whereas the second test will always check 1024(32*32) pixels.<br>3) Now, there are still more things that need to be taken into account. The second test (32x32 vs 1024x768) does not need to check 1024 pixels. It could return on the first colliding pixels, which in the best case scenario means 1 actual pixel checked. In the worst case it means all 1024 where checked. Since Max2D creates a collision mask, (I believe) that creates an image detailing what pixels collided, this means that it will check all 1024 pixels, even though the first set may collide. If this is infact the case, then maybe there is a way to disable this functionality? I'm personally not sure as I don't use imagescollide.<br>4) Speaking of which... why are you using imagescollide? It seems that alot of newbies use this, and want pixel perfect collisions, when infact they are rarely needed, and in most situations undesirable even. Pixel perfect collision can (and will) lead to characters getting stuck or caught on things, and other bad gameplay factors. Pixel perfect collisions are insanely slow. Infact slower now that we use 2d in 3d, I believe. Pixel perfect isn't actually always pixel perfect when we do 2d in 3d as games do now. Etc, etc...<br><br>I would look into circle/circle based collision, or atleast see if imagesoverlap (square/square collision) couldn't be used instead. Circle/circle collision is my advice, as it can be extremely fast, and actually tends to lead to the best gameplay imo.<br><br>Now, as with everything above, there are exceptions. If your doing a 'point and click' adventure type game, then imagescollide may be the best for you... however even in that case you probley actually only need to check if 1 pixel (the point of the cursor) collides or not, not the whole cursor image.<br><br>Hope that isn't too confusing, and hope it helps, if anyone else wants to ellaborate or correct on anthing I said, feel free. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I've just visited the tutorial you gave and I am currently reading through it. I wish you could buy a manual or something (I used to love manuals!) which could tell you exactly what each function does - I wasn't entirely sure what collision layers were before.<br>   I do have some further questions  though<br><br>1. Why does Max create a collison 'mask' showing what pixels have collided exactly - surely it justs needs to know that a collision has occured, not store the details. Is there another function that accesses this then?<br>2. When using ImagesCollide does Blitx just use a mask (like a 2 colour bitmap - black and white) for each image.<br><br>The program I wrote above was just a test to compare speeds because I thought that there shouldn't really that much difference between checking a small image with a small image AND a small image with a large image - given that the number of pixels checked should be the same. It just seems weird that I can only do 28 of the latter type of collision in a frame (60Hz).<br>       I know my approach is somewhat inefficient but I was planning on using the power of modern PCs to save me programming time and make it very easy to add new enemies, obstacles and objects to my program. When I had my character going up a slope for example I could just check the next 2 positions up in a vertical direction using ImagesCollide and if the first one was free I'd move the character there, and if not He'd go to the 2nd one, and if he couldn't go there then the slope was too steep. It meant I could just draw my game background in Paint without much regard to actually defining slopes as slopes etc and I could just destroy bits of the background and my game objects would move happily about :)<br>     Well this is really ineffiecient but I divided each frame up into 20 units and I never had an object moving more than 20 pixels a frame. This meant the most an object could move is 1 pixel before a collision check is done, hence objects never pass through each other or the background.  I only actually updated the screen though every 20 units, so the objects weren't being drawn every unit.<br>     I just thought this would not be too strenous for a fast computer, I can do 3000 of the first type of collision( small with small), so i don't think it was wildly optimistic. <br>   <br>I will definitely give collide image a go though. Are the 32 layers related to bitplanes at all, or are they totally different entities?<br>     <br>Thank you very much again for all the help -  everyone here is very helpful!<br><br>Rico :)<br><br>P.S. I do eventually want to do a system using polygons, because I would love to do a 2d physics system for a platform game where you can shoot platforms down which tip and fall and where evvery object can be pushed or picked up - like Phun I suppose. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There is -NOT- the same amount of data testing in a 32x32 vs 32x32 images collide and a 32x32 vs 1024x768 test. The main reason for this is that pixels checked are only the ones that actually overlap. With your small images, I'm willing to bet that most of the time they don't overlap at all. With the large vs small image, they always overlap 100% (if the small image is on screen at all). Even with the collision layers stuff, this is true.<br><br>Reguardless of which collideimages type command you use, you -will not- get much faster with pixel perfect collision.

So there is a big difference.<br>    Of course you are right about looking into alternative methods but it does seem odd it is so slow. Really to do one collision check (in my example) a function needs to check only 32x32 pixels against another 32x32 square.  Thats why I wanted a faster ImagesCollide function when doing a small image vs big image check. <br>     Do graphics cards have blitters?, I rember the old Blitz used to tell you if  a blitter was available in certain gfx modes.

Yes I noticed that I can a very fast fps when the image is colliding with the background every frame. Maybe after detecting a collision once at a position it doesn't check again? until the image is moved ? I don't know how the collisions work internally.<br>     My computer (well, I'm using someone elses actually)isn't amazingly fast but I am thinking of buying a new one.  I will however have to change my approach, I like Dreamora's idea of just checking against the players immediate surroundings. I could chop the background up into 32x32 squares and then only check the 4 squares under the character (but still use CollideImages). I was wondering if there is an easy way to write part of a  image to a collision layer, beacuse it would be ace if I could just write the 32x32 section of the background below the player to a collision layer.<br>   The only thing is, is if I have a lot of objects moving around the screen all doing collison checks against the background I might end up effectively drawing the whole background to the collision layer anyway albeit in 32x32 chunks.  Anyhow I can see ways this can be speeded up like Dreamora said. So I'll get to work on it<br>     Thanks - Rico<br><br>P.S.

Because you're testing the same images multiple times you don't get the benefit of Collideimage... I suspect.<br>If you need to do LOTS of collisions then search for Shifted Grid. I think there is a B3D (maybe a Bmax version) example on these forums.<br>Alternatively check the code archives for the customised 'shape' collisions (circle. rectangle/ elipse etc) as these will not be as accurate but quicker and, maybe, good enough. You could also try creating collision hotspots on your player and background so you can cut down the number of areas that need to be checked. Personally, I would the tilemap method if your current method doesn't give best results. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Especially if you add delta or independant timing logic handling. I've seen games that when they have alot of collision checking going on slow down to 15-20-30 frames per second, but it isn't that bad due to the delta/logic handling. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
