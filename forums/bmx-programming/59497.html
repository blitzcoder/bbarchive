As i design my engine in theory, i often ask myself "where's the balance".  <br><br>I want to make a 3d action flight game and i want triggers.  I want triggers that are physical and ones that aren't.  Triggers that are general purpose and ones that are specific(for easy of us and visual icons).  <br>This make perfect sense for a scripting language.  <br><br>Now the issue comes in..how of the game should actually be scripted.  Bullets?  Ships? Controls?  I'm deciding to maybe take an unreal approuch and almost make the hardcore just for intense math, collision, graphics, and music.  <br><br>If i have a ship type..with properties such as speed, health, ammo.. should that be in the script or in the hardcode?  <br><br>I start to think about how many "linking" functions i'll have to make from blitz to LUA and that's alot of time as well.  <br><br>On top of that, scripting isn't fast i'm guessing. <br><br>I've researched LUA and i've thought about the complexities quite a bit...  Having one variable in one script access another.  Saving state and so on.<br><br>So i'm here asking where's the balancing point..for one programmer? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
