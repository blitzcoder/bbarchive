</pre><br>Future's starting here and now!<br><br>So I'd suggest to add a new command named Delete which sets all vars pointing to an object to Null, calls the Delete method inside the object and releases the object's memory.<br>For example:<br><pre class=code>Strict

Local obj1:class = New class
Local obj2:class = obj1

If obj1 = Null
  Print "obj1 = Null" 'This line is not printed
EndIf
If obj2 = Null
  Print "obj2 = Null" 'This line is not printed
EndIf

Delete obj1 'delete this object and set obj1 and obj2 to Null.

If obj1 = Null
  Print "obj1 = Null" 'This line is printed
EndIf
If obj2 = Null
  Print "obj2 = Null" 'This line is printed
EndIf

Type class
EndType</pre><br>I know the BMX reference counting system stores only how many vars are pointing to an object and not the addresses of all of them.<br>But I think with some tricks you still can add this command:<br>Each BMX object has a hidden field used by GC which stores how many vars are pointing to it; if this field reaches 0 the object is removed by GC.<br>I guess this field is a system integer (32bit), but I think there are never 2^32 = 4,294,967,296 vars pointing to it, so I suggest to use the last bit to store a special boolean value storing whether the object has already removed or is still used.<br>So Delete has only two things to do:<br>1.: Call Method Delete() inside the object.<br>2.: Set the special 'object is removed bit' to true.<br>But than there's the question "When is the object's memory released?"<br>Well; each time accessing an object var the program checks whether the object's special bit is set or not; if true it'll set this var to Null and decrements the object's hidden field; so the object will be found by GC as soon the hidden field reaches 0 and it will delete it like each other object, -well, not really:<br>If the object's special bit is set to true the GC doesn't call the object's Delete() method because the Delete command already called it.<br>Here's another example:<br><pre class=code>Strict

Local obj1:class = New class 'The object's hidden field is now set to 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000001 because there's one var pointing to it (obj1).
Local obj2:class = obj1 'Now it's set to 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000010 because there're two vars pointing to it (obj1 and obj2).

If obj1 = Null
  Print "obj1 = Null" 'This line is not printed
EndIf
If obj2 = Null
  Print "obj2 = Null" 'This line is not printed
EndIf

Delete obj1 'Now the hidden field is set to 10000000 00000000 00000000 00000010 because there're two vars pointing to it, but the object is already removed.
            'The two object vars are not really set to Null because the Delete command doesn't know the addresses of them.



                  'Before any code's executed the program checks whether the object's special bit's set or not
If obj1 = Null    'It'll notice that it's set to true so it'll set obj1 to Null and decrements the object's hidden field
                  'The hidden field is now 10000000 00000000 00000000 00000001; obj1 is Null, so (obj1 = Null) is true and the If block is executed

  Print "obj1 = Null" 'This line is printed
EndIf

                  'Before any code's executed the program checks whether the object's special bit's set or not
If obj2 = Null    'It'll notice that it's set to true so it'll set obj1 to Null and decrements the object's hidden field
                  'The hidden field is now 10000000 00000000 00000000 00000000; obj2 is Null, so (obj2 = Null) is true and the If block is executed
                  'But here the GC notices this object with no var pointing to it and releases the object's memory.

  Print "obj2 = Null" 'This line is printed

Weak references allow to point to objects that *can* be reclaimed by the system (because such references don't account for the "liveness" of the object), and when they are the references are simply nulled out. Still don't see any connection with the feature request?<br>Now I wouldn't call the fact that *every* object can be deleted at any time (as proposed) a very smart thing, but if some objects were specifically tagged as deletable (say by deriving from a special class), then you could easily find uses for this while still not compromising the security of your program (given than for any other class you'd rest assured that instances won't be suddenly deleted).<br>Or why not, precisely implement weak references, which would probably fit the original poster's need.<br>But I think the "special class" solution would be easier to implement efficiently, in particular because it wouldn't affect the final code for any class that doesn't inherit from such a special class (so no performance hit if you don't use it).<br><br><div class="quote"> There's no need. <br></div>There is probably *little* need, that's a difference. But I admit I never really needed  it myself (but again I mostly program in C++ where I manage the memory myself so that's hardly a proof of unusefulness in a garbage collected language).<br>And more to the point, in the case of the original poster it seems the feature really is unneeded. But I just don't believe someone can throw things like "you don't need it or you're a dumbass stupid programmer". That looks like plain arrogant to me. Would I have seen the least constructive argument, that would have been another story. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Delete() at best can set every variable referencing that instance to Null for the programmer, but it cannot make the actual variables disappear.  without the programmer checking for Null in all routines that could use a reference variable to that type instance after its been Delete()d, an error will occur anyway.  so, it can be said that its good programming practice to always check for an instance pointer being Null before using it if there is any chance that it can be Null.  to extend this for the TWindow example given, add a Method called IsValid() to TWindow that will return false if handle is 0.  so now your check for Null becomes something like:<br><pre class=code>
If Not MyWindow Or Not MyWindow.IsValid() Then RuntimeError "Oops"
</pre><br>chances are that if the programmer is trying to use a variable that is no longer valid in some way, then they probably want to know about it anyway since it is more than likely a bug in program flow. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
