Im in a need for soon making some more nice 3D art in my installations, therefore my massive investment of time to figure out the hole wrapper and 3D engine thing, my 2 cent on that matter is TV3D seems to be a very good choice to stick with.<br><br>But please would someone be so super kind to write some easy understandable tutorials on how to use the TV3D engine and it’s wrapper. <br><br>Like:<br><br>1.	setting up the environment and make it show a primitive (cube)<br>2.	setting up a scene step by step, plus plotting a ew primitives<br>3.	walk through on shaders and texture<br>4.	light setting<br>5.	movement (world coordinates and object coordinates)<br>6.	controlling camera<br>7.	interaction by keys and mouse<br>8.	advanced features and effects (bumbmapping and the like)<br><br>I think there’s a lot of people out there with the same wishes, im not sure it possible since most of you talk about bad documentation on third party 3D engines, but you guy’s seems to have some control of it.<br><br>Hope anyone have the time and energy to write some tutorials, could make them “wiki” so everyone can alter in them when they find bug’s or the like.<br><br>Kind regards<br>Mads ny larsen <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Frankly once you've got that far, you should be more than able to use any of the code for other languages. The wrapper is written so that all the code you find in C++, C#, VB and even Delphi should work with minimal changes.

Except for BlitzMax being cooler. :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
