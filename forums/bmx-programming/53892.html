(dont forget to close and reopen the source code file in BMAX).<br><br>I think the "correct" PC-esque solution would be to open Darwin up (the Mac CLI [version of MS-DOS]) but as it's Unix based I havn't a clue of the commands.<br><br>Bloody aweful machine. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I've done that several times with several different versions of Mac OS X since the public beta way back in 99 and I've never had my root structure mucked up.<br><br>As for Mac OS X being to much like Windows I won't comment.<br><br>With Mac applications ".exe" being folders that has been known for a long time. In fact even in Mac OS System 1 - 9 applications were 2 parts, the resources and binary. They appeared to the user as a single file but were in reality 2. You could edit the resources but you had to use a special app such as ResEdit or Resourcer. I tend to think have all of my applications resources and frameworks in one folder which appears to end users as a single file is much better then having DLLs in 2 or 3 different places and having my other resources in open directorys were users can play with 'em. Makes it very easy to install or delete apps without worring about cruff hidden away in \windows\system or some such crap Windows does.<br><br>To help with losing folders, open up the terminal application and you will be able to access everything via that. You can change permissions/rename folders etc via the command line. Mac OS X is based on BSD unix. chmod will let you change permissions and I think from memory ren will let you rename items. The ls command = dir.<br><br>I'm sure if you don't like the computer someone would buy it from you on eBay. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
