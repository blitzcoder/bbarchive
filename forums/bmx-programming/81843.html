I ran into a major issue back than that is that i did not had the knowlage to create a decent UDP lib myself, altough i have some basic understanding of Networking, the tech involved with making a stable UDP engine for MMORPG is rather complicated, not to mention the security. You do not want people to tune in with packet readers and mess arround. Remote functions, etc.. I know there where some prommesing libs back then, but non seemed finished or have any support. Now, about a year later i hoped maybe it has come to a change. Could some people who have been checking the forums since 2007, maybe provide me with an update on wheter there have been new sounds recently?<br>Just imagine what we could do with a good lib. Again, i dont mind paying for a good lib even if its over 500 dollars. Question to me still is, can BlitzMax do it? and Do we have a Lib for 2009?<br>Its a hobby project, nothing commercial as yet... but i so love to get it running. I dont really want to use another tool. I like BlitzMax a lot.<br><br>Thank you! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Stuff like login-servers (lobby functionality), bandwidth throttling, interpolation, encryption etc. It's one thing to know what these things do, and completely another write it and debug it and actually run it with a huge amount of networked computers to tune it. Libs like rakknet are probably quite well tested and tuned.<br><br>My guess is that time invested in wrapping up rakknet (or similar established lib) is far more well-invested than writing something from scratch.<br><br><div class="quote"> <br>Question to me still is, can BlitzMax do it?<br> <br></div><br><br>Afaik noone has actually written a MMORPG in BlitzMax yet, so no one has a prof of concept to your question, but BlitzMax is on the other hand "just another computer language" with a DLL interface. If you would go for rakknet (as an example) the networking code is still written in C++.<br><br>Professional programming today is very much about finding the right framework/libs and binding them together in a sensible way much in the way some of us built lego when we where kids: If you are to build a website today you will almost certainly go for an established web-framework. When I used to build a lego-houses (as a 10-year old) I also built it with premade-pieces that where windows, doors and sometimes even wall-modules. The pieces where my "house building framework" and I sure had it easier so build a cool-looking house than some kid in the stoneage that had stones, sticks and mud to his disposal. (Stone, sticks and mud in this example is the "writing everything from scratch option) :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I guess im in a unique position of having a dedicated box myself (heavy machine) and pulled off already an old morpg with 2000 ppl. Thing is i had to quit that because i found the aprouch was wrong, so i wanted todo a make over, but that ment also getting a better online lib. I guess RakNet wrapper, if its working now, is something i could use then. Where can i find it? And it was free.. i meen, the costs where high, so you need to come up with an alternative from a comercial point of few. Theres no way competing, but if you ahve a unique game concept you can charge a onetime fee or allow additional items to be bought, or you find advertisers. Nonetheless 2000 ppl is not enough, you need a lot before advertisers are interested. Then comes the issue of security, because onces real money is involved, ppl go try and hack the stuff. I know this guy who crack every software from adobe to games. Only real thing that works is make sure you keep it all serverside coded.

Also, TNL's RPC implementation is far superior to what is provided in Raknet, in that it parses the argument list to the RPC and marshalls each element into the bit stream automatically. Plus TNL provides a security model, various forms of DoS protection and more. <br></div> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Paying for such work is no problem. But there is a problem if you try and do everything yourself. I meen, ofcourse you need to overcome certain disiplines, but making a MMORPG all alone, and getting involved in stuff your not THAT good at, is just not wise. Whilest someone maybe is willing to earn a few bucks, 500 or 1000 maybe, or maybe more, and has a freehand to put his expertise in action, and write a small MMORPG engine, or just a wrapper, thats best for everyone. Good for the economy to. Especialy in these times.<br><br>@Retimer<br>Yes, painfully i have to agree. There is people with just a fewer users that make good profits. I assume they know the things another one (me for example) lacks, when it comes to marketing and promoting your game. See, skill is not my problem. Getting my stuff out on the market is a problem. But as its more of like a hobby, i guess i dont do enough networking. But making a good profitable MMORPG is quite a challange. But tahts what is so motivating, and so challanging. If pulled something off before, its just it was aimed for kids in the range of 8 to 16. Problem with that is, they dont throw even $5 at your project cause even if they want, they dont have a creditcard or paypal or anything. So they need to ask mom/dad, and they say no (obviously).<br>So... go figure... i just had to re-do the whole concept. <br><br>:) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Sure you might be able to find some student that will do a bit more hours for that money, so lets assume you find one that will work 50 hours ($20x50=$1000). 50 hours of work goes quite far for wrapping a nontrivial lib (like a sound lib/network lib/maybe even a 3d engine) but for writing an MMORPG engine? Even if this MMORPG engine is build from established libs exclusively and just glue-code is written i think even 500 hours is not sufficient. If you already had a game running 2000 players (very impressive!) and need a platform that can support what, 20k? You know World of Warcraft, Warhammer online and Lord of the Rings online don't oftan have that many players online on one realm, and even there the technology is distributed servers with several servers/realm. I've taken part in raids of &gt; 250 ppl (as an example I took part in this one: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDjBsEb1wFQ)" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDjBsEb1wFQ)</a> and we had the server crash on us when we all got inside one zone. And this was in WoW probably the most polished MMORPG in the world today with gazzillions of work-hours invested in it.<br><br>Ok, to get to my conslusion: I think you are aiming to high. If you already have an engine that allows for 2000k simultaneous players I would suggest you do this:<br><br>1) Write an entertaining game that attracts adult players. (that have CC like you mentioned.)<br>2) Provide free demo accounts for your game (10 days free play) to hook players.<br>3) Make it cost ~$5 a month with nice easy registration through your site. Provide paypal-payment and stuff so people pulling you their CC feel secure when paying you.<br>4) When you get 1900k paying players you already have an income of ~$9500 a month and by then you should have no problem to buy another server + more bandwidth and redirect the creation of new player chars to your new realm.<br><br>Maybe this sounds like utopia but its still more realistic than getting anything MMORPGish for a $1000 investment. Well thats my opinion anyway. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
