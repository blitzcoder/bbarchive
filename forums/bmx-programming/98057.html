(assuming you just want to store them)<br>Storage approach: How are you storing the values that make up a point? in an object, in lists, in arrays. What are the individual values, 4 byte standard ints, or actual bytes, are you using floats for the speed and or the position? any doubles/longs/other overhead? Don't forget the code running around all this data takes up some space and will have it's own variables taking up more space etc. If you're using bytes for everything then you can't display more than 65536 points because that's how many pixels are in a grid of 256x256 and you can't display sub pixels, and you can't give it a position any bigger because of the size of a byte. Different types of variables are also faster than others depending on the platform, e.g. ints are typically the fastest. so you'll get much more speed using ints but they take up 4x the memory space.<br>Processor speed/capacity: if you're updating them what are you changing, the position, the speed, the color, all? How computationally heavy are the updates, incrementing a color value or generating 3 new random numbers, etc.<br>Optimization approach: Assuming you're only changing the position and you have static color sets you could group them together which would reduce your overhead at the expense of potentially hitting list/array limits based on the architecture.<br>System and other overhead: Everything lives in or at least passes through RAM, if you have a 2GB of hard ram and you're running windows 7 you'll have a massively different amount of that free vs. XP. What about other programs? VRAM and the paging that that could bring about could have a HUUUUGE impact if you're pushing the hardware limits... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I personally like to think that the CPU is way faster than the GPU, even though the GPU is capable of making far more computations per frame BUT you can't use it as flexible as the CPU, plus the CPU is much easier to optimize.

Since your pixmap is too big to fit in the lower-level caches, you'll end up constantly evicting cache lines a later iteration of the loop would use, so the CPU will have to take the round trip to main memory a lot - which is slow!<br>Instruction reordering and instruction level parallelism on today's CPUs will help reduce the performance impact a little, but performance wise this is still not a very good solution.<br><br>What's really the problem here is that you're doing the actual rendering on the CPU and then draw the results on screen using DrawPixmap (which is pretty much creation of a new texture buffer from scratch, followed by a DMA from CPU to GPU memory - in each frame!). The GPU sits there idle while the CPU does all the work.<br><br>What you'd normally do to get a really fast particle system is to create a VBO, fill it with the initial particle positions and then hand it to the GPU. From then on, a vertex shader<br>1. rendering into an FBO mapped VBO<br>-or-<br>2. with transform feedback<br>will take care of the particle transformations, feed them into a fragment shader and then process the next frame. The data does not touch the CPU after the initialization; it is always kept in GPU memory, processed from there and fed back into it.<br>Particle systems are pretty much optimal for good rendering performance, since geometry is predictably uniform and simple, and in your case, does not even require texture lookups, which pose a bit of a bandwidth problem.<br><br><div class="quote"> You seem to not take into account the ---&gt; memory latency &lt;--- which is the actual bottleneck for both CPU and GPU <br></div><br>You forget that geometry processing on the GPU is much much different from how you'd do software rendering on the CPU.<br>When you feed a bunch of polygons into the pipeline, the GPU will first read from the index buffer, determine the vertices that should be processed next, assign shader cores to handle them and proceed with the next indices. After the shader cores have finished executing the vertex shaders, the results are fed into a vertex cache, upon which the geometry assembly unit will look at the indices and the vertices in cache, bundle them into a renderable primitive, send them to the rasterization stage (which consists of a whole lot of preemptive clipping/culling, hierarchical depth/stencil tests etc. - basically magic). The rasterizer will generate a whole lot of fragments, send them back to shader cores, has them do the work and then finally writes back to memory.<br><br>First of all: Vertex processing for quads is cache optimal. Memory access in the VBO is linear, there is no cache pollution, no false eviction and the only cache misses you get are on the cold cache (i.e. when accessing the first vertex). After shader cores have been assigned, things get even better - each streaming multiprocessor (ndivia terminology, btw) has its own cache, the involved data (vertex attributes) are perfectly local and the results are not written back to memory, they are fed into another cache (fast!). If one vertex has a cache miss, it doesn't matter. All the other hundred cores (or how many your GPU has...) will keep working and process other vertices.<br>Each stage of the pipeline has its own specialized cache and the GPU will do its best to order accesses to memory to utilize full bandwidth.<br><br>Point is: <i>All of this happens in parallel</i>. It doesn't matter if processing a vertex/fragment causes a memory fetch (or a cache read), everything else keeps working. In your CPU example, the loop *will* stall if you end up thrashing your cache due to random accesses to the pixmap (although the effect, as said before, is slightly reduced thanks to instruction reordering and instruction level parallelism).<br>It's always important to remember that the GPU is optimized for throughput, not latency. If a pixel takes a bit longer to process, it really doesn't matter! As long as you can chuck out the 30-50 Gigapixels/s fillrate, you're alright.<br><br>I mean, we're already at realtime fluid simulations with several hundreds of thousands of particles. I'm sure that a few million particles simply moving across the screen in a linear fashion are feasible :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In my lengthy post I explained why your code was memory bound and not instruction bound and how the GPU cirumvents this problem by specialized caches, controlled access patterns and parallelization.
