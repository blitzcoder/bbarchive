To not put it in the type/Class, whilst doable, is counter intuitive, because the list is intrinsic with the type.<br>On a simple nameing level, the global can be reffered to as "List", within any functions or methods of the type, because its full name is <i>TGameObject.List</i>. As it can in any other type that has a seperate list of instances, because each Type, is also a "namespace"<br><br>Now maybe this seems contrary to the whole purpose of encapsulating the properties of a TYPE or CLASS, but the List IS a property of the Type, so it also needs to be within the definition.

type A
 field blah:int;
end type

local myA1:A = new A;
local myA2:A = new A;
</pre><br><br>doing this will create 2 instances of type A and store them in the variables myA1 and myA2.<br>Let's say you did this inside a function, this would mean that as soon as the function is finished executing, these 2 variables go 'out of scope' and they will be marked for garbage collecting. This means that the 2 instances you just created will be destroyed.<br><br>In blitz3d/Blitz+ this was not the case, because internally, b3d/b+ would add the instances you create to a list and you had to manually delete any instance when needed.<br><br>Getting the same functionality as B3D/B+ in Blitzmax requires that you add the instance to a List. This list makes sure that there is always at least 1 reference to your type instance and it will not be destroyed.<br><br>A simple way to 'automate' this is to add/remove the type instance to the List in it's Constructor/Destructors.<br><br><pre class=code>
Type MyBaseType

  Method New()
    List.AddLast( Self ); '// as son as this instance is created, add it to the list.
  End Method


  Method Dispose()
     List.Remove( Self ); '// as soon as this instance requires being destroyed, remove its last existing reference, in the List.
  End method
end Type
</pre><br><br>Note that in the example I have not used the standard Delete() Method that is normall used as a type's Destructor, but I have used a custom Dispose() Method. The reason for this is the Chicken or the Egg problem.<br><br>Delete() gets automaticly called when the object is being consumed by the Garbage Collector. The same way New() is being called when you create a new instance of your type.<br>But, the garbage collector only kicks in, if there is No more reference to the Type instance. So here you have the problem that Delete() will never be called, because there will always be at least 1 reference to the object stored in the list. Therefor we use a custom Dispose() method to force the object removal from the List. After this is done, Delete() will be called at some point.<br><br><br>Any other types you create that require maintaining a list, can simply inherit from this BaseType.<br><br><pre class=code>
Type SomeCharacterType Extends MyBaseType
   Field Image:TImage;

  Method New()
    Image = CreateImage(....);
  End Method


  Method Dispose() '// We can even Override the Dispose method from the MyBaseType type.
    Image = null;
    Super.Dispose(); '// In order to keep the original functionality, you must manually call Super.Dispose() here though.
  End Method
End Type
</pre><br><br>This ensures that SomeCharacterType will automaticly make use of the List and you dont have to keep track of it here as well. Remember to call SomeCharacterType.Dispose() to actually delete it if you wish to so though. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This one in particular is called a Singleton(http://www.dofactory.com/Patterns/PatternSingleton.aspx).<br><br><div class="quote"> <br>Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it. <br> <br></div><br><br>Design patterns are meant to standardize the layout of code and offer solutions to potential pittfalls that may occur in OOP programming. <br><br>The reason I am using it here is because the situation faced here is best solved using a Singleton. And simply because it has become a habbit I picked up working with C#/.NET.<br><br>This does bring us back to the original post: Why do I make the 'Instance' variable Part of the Type and not have it outside the Type? This to is done partly as per the Design pattern specification. In my view, this Instance is the 'Entry Point' or 'Door' to the only available version of my Manager class. And therefor it has very strong ties to the Type/Class itself. Which gives only one logical solution, make it part of the Class/Type itself.<br><br>Also, as said, I have been using Design Patterns in C# rather extensively and C# does not support Global Variables or Functions. Wlell, not in the sense that Blitzmax knows them anyways. C# only supports Static and Constant members for a class, which can only be defined as a part of a class (as is done in the code in my Manager type).<br><br>When dealing with OO code it may be wise to read up on Design patterns. Some of them are rather complicated and some may not serve you any purpose what so ever, but if anything, they provide a usefull insight into the way of thinking behind OOP programming and may help you solve some potential problems you may encounter, before they actually happen by sticking with a tried and tested way of designing your code.<br><br>Note that contrary to what some OO guru's may tell you, Design patterns are NOT the Be-all-end-all. They are not some magical way to make your program Bugfree and the easiest to understand code you have ever written. That's bogus. Also some patterns are expressly made to cover some very very rare situations and will hardly ever proove usefull. Also many patterns are geared towards everyday use in commercial software design, where performance is not often as paramount as in a high stakes environment as a Game. So you may, at times, want to do things your own way because it's simply a lot more efficient and squeezes just a few more Fps out of your engine.<br><br>Think of these patterns as Guidelines, not Rules.<br><br>Ironically, even the hardcore OO programmers, who used to be completely full of Design Patterns, have realized this and they created 'Anti Patterns'. Yes that's right, these are official :p<br><br><div class="quote"> <b>Anti-patterns</b>, also referred to as pitfalls, are classes of commonly-reinvented bad solutions to problems. They are studied, as a category, in order that they may be avoided in the future, and that instances of them may be recognized when investigating non-working systems <br></div><br><br>They are not just for study though, but also used in situations where a regular Design pattern just wont do the job. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
