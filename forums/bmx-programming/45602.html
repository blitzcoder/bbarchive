There are plently of "latest games", even AAA titles that don't have 2.000 bucks worth of hardware requirements. Somewhat oddly, these are then the ones who go on to break previous sales records. Most people I know don't even play games on the PC anymore - one of my mates, when faced with having to upgrade his PC for the third time, decided to just get every major console instead, and all the games he wanted. In the end, he had saved nearly 400 dollars, and gotten a whole host of brilliant games, the likes of which the PC hasn't had a decent one released for in as long as I can remember! Oh, and unlike me, he can already play GTA: San Andreas, while I have to wait until June (by which time, I hope my PC will still be able to handle it. *Sigh*).<br><br><div class="quote"> Perhaps Mark could add support for all DirectX versions (from the first version until DX9). <br></div>No. Currently BlitzMAX requires a 3D API for real--time rotation and scaling.

Platforms that have been abandoned by even the Russians is probably not the best market in the world.<br><br>When working as in independant software developer, your number of sales is directly proportional to your ability to pay your mortgage. So you'll want to be spreading your eggs to more baskets. Now if you where Valve, and where just sitting on the digital equivalent of crack, then yes, you can relly on gamers to sell their family into slavery and take out a second mortgage (one of those you get by e-mail no less) in their homes, in order to buy the latest, greatest Alienware PC they can possibly get. For everyone who isn't Valve, you have to be a little more restricctive with which limitations you put on your gamme. Why do you think all those bargain deer hunter 3D games sell so rediculously well? Because they're better than DOOM3? Or because they'll run on anything you throw at then, regardless of how "stupid" or "lazy" all the 1337 gamers think think they are? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Just think about it, if it has taken this long for Mark to get BMAX to it's current state, and now adding DX9 support, imagine how long it would take for him to add support for older (sucky) technologies that are irrelevant. <br></div>First of all, DX7 is in no way "suckier" than DX9, and second of all, it's not quite irrelevant. Oh and incidently, it takes three times as long to write a compiler as it does an application, and since BlitzMAX development time has been mostly on the compiler, I'd say "not as long as you seem to suggest".<br><br><div class="quote"> There are still millions of Win95 machines out there and I would like to have my games run on those machines.  <br></div>Yeah.

But not everyone using BlitzMAX is doing so from a commercial standpoint. And I can see why they couldn't care less about DX7. It's the same mentality as another product out there: Who cares if it only works on my machine and crashes randomly on everyone elses. I g07z 50m3 m4d 5h4d3rz, L0L!!!1!!<br><br><div class="quote">  Wasn't part of the point of Blitzmax to give the people asking for fancy features access? <br></div>Well the reasons are individual I'm sure. Personally it's mostly a matter of cross platform capability and object orientation. If I wanted to mess around with the internals of the API anymore, I would be doing it in C. Why bother when a whole game in Blitz is fewer lines than setting up and opening a DirectX display in C? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
