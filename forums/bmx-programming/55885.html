From personal experience: you can't explain OO-benefits to ppl who only did small-scale apps of only a few thousand lines.<br>I got a lil' bit o' c++ at my study, years ago, explained using small examples (bull@#!* like "putting a coin in a piggybank object" etc.). Back then I was still happily QBasic'ing all the way.. naturally I completely failed to see the point of OO.<br><br>The funny part is that no-one needs to be taught OO, it's discovered! Usually when you're doing multiple thousand lines of large-scale apps in a procedural language, you think of solutions how to make things more structured, automagically you 'invent' a solution... OO !<br><br>What's nice about OO?<br>- Datahiding<br>- Modularity (when designed well)<br>- Large degree of reusability<br>- Can speed up construction of you apps largely, tho the initial start might be a bit slower as you don't go rushing things but take your time to setup things nice 'n tidy. 'OO' isn't 'modular' perse. It's just that OO makes it way more easy to do modular stuff. In the end it's the coder who makes things modular, not OO.<br><br>And for the rest, there's new non-OO stuff in BMax as well.<br><br><br>Personally I see OOP as the 'upgrade' for Procedural programming. Some code-gurus think ppl shouldn't ever touch Procedural languages and start immediately with OOP languages. I don't think so, I think you need to know the night to appreciate the day. Why would you appreciate objects if you don't know what programming without them means? So, my ultimate programming-history would be: linenumber basic in the 80's on homecomputers, followed by QBasic to learn about procedural thingies, followed by Blitzplus, to learn about events and windows-GUI, followed by Blitzmax, to learn about OOP. In this case you've done it all, you learnt every new thing coming from a situation where you didn't have that thing yet.<br><br>So, ask yourself: 'Am I a procedural guru yet, making huge large-scale programs already, and getting lost in the chaos when things are exceeding 5000 lines?' If yes: you're prolly ready for OOP. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This means that you get a fairly large executable file.<br><br>Since Blitzmax is made up from from smaller modules, you can compile a program and only include the portions it actually needs -- so if you don't use network access you don't have to add the networking library, if you don't use sound you don't have to add the sound library, if you only use JPG and not BMP or PNG images you can drop those two image libraries, etc -- resulting in smaller executable files.<br>The other advantage is that people can create their own modules, so a 3rd party can create an extension to blitzmax and add completely new commands... Or even replace some built-in commands with better versions.<br><br>A lot of the actual sourcecode for the blitzmax commands themselves are included, so people (who know what they're doing) can make their own modifications to the core of the language itself. with the older versions like Blitz3D or blitzPlus, you are a lot less flexible. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

As I wrote already, it's prolly no use to  explain it, you have to discover it. You can easily teach yourself why OO (or better: datahiding and modularity) is handy by making a large editor right now, and don't come back unless you've 8000 lines of unique code. :D<br><br><br>Ok, a small hint then?<br><br>Imagine you're making a tile-editor, that's not a map-editor but more like a classic drawtool like deluxepaint, but without freehand drawing, just a zoomer for tiles.<br><br>Easy! Let's setup what we need:<br><br>- Mainwindow<br>- Zoom editor, big canvas somewhere on our mainwindow<br>- Palette, with a number of colors to choose from<br>- Some manipulation-buttons like rotate, mirror, colorfill etc.<br>- The 'image' where we store all our finished tiles.<br><br>So the idea is to fill our big image with pieces o' grass, water, brick, rock, rooftops, windows, doors etc. etc. Everything we need for our Zelda RPG!<br><br>Seriously, you can do this in about 2000 lines o' blitzplus code.. I'm talking out of experience here, that's why it's sooo easy for me to come up with this particular example. :P<br><br>We don't know datahiding, modular, so we just code like a madman, all with global vars so we can access everything everywhere.<br><br>Like: (assume non-bmax here)<br><br>Dim paletteR(AmountOfColors)<br>Dim paletteG(AmountOfColors)<br>Dim paletteB(AmountOfColors)<br><br>Dim Zoom(31x31) ' for a 32x32 zoomer<br><br>Dim StorageImage(511,511) ' for a 512x512 image<br><br>..and a lot of gadgets.<br><br>Result: seriously: in 3 days you can have things working like a charm, without ever touching something as 'complex' as OO!<br><br>Sofar there appear to be no problems, and indeed, there simple aren't any!<br><br><br>The problems start <i>now</i>. :D<br><br><br>You're obviously the user of your own app, so you'll start adding features, that's just common practice.. creative ppl invent features faster than one can code them.<br><br>Suddenly you realised you hadn't thought of any UNDO mechanism. Yipes, wadayado..? Let's first focus at the palette:<br><br>This could be a solution:<br>Dim paletteR(AmountOfColors,1)<br>Dim paletteG(AmountOfColors,1)<br>Dim paletteB(AmountOfColors,1)<br><br>When we start modifying we could store everything from (,0) in (,1).<br>When we perform an undo operation we could copy the data from (,1) to (,0).<br><br>And you know what, it works!<br><br>Another possible solution:<br>add these!<br>Dim paletteRtmp(AmountOfColors)<br>Dim paletteGtmp(AmountOfColors)<br>Dim paletteBtmp(AmountOfColors)<br><br>Same store/restore mechanism. And again: it works!<br><br>But as you might have spotted, the amount of 'weird overhead' grows. And this is just for an UNDO for a palette editor.<br><br>Next, the creative mind decides your tile-editor should in fact include a full-featured map-editor!<br>Yipes! Ok, add another fullscreen panel and some key to switch between tile-editor and map-editor and it'll be allright.<br><br>Again, more oddness.<br><br>Oh, meanwhile: the palette-editor, used to be for 256 colors, you really need more colors.. your palette-editor layout changes drastically ofcourse.<br><br>Ah, and what's next? Your 32x32 zoomer was all nice 'n stuff, but you need more formats! like 16x16, 48x48, 32x64 (!) etc.<br><br>More! Your map-editor shows you that creating convincing maps requires way more tiles than the 512x512pixel images provides you. Hence, you think it should be handy to have a dynamic image-size!<br><br>Hey! Why are your default maps always square? Must be able to expand or shrink them at all the 4 edges!<br><br>Say! One map-layer?? We need at least 3, including real parallax-scroll!<br><br>Gosh. What's a game without enemies and items? We need a special layer for that. But, naturally this won't be a map-layer, but a list, so items/npc's aren't fixed to the grid (amongst other reasons)<br><br><br>As you see, all newly invented stuff, probably stuff you forgot about when you first rushed together your perfectly working app in 3 days.<br><br>This is a so-called one-shot application.<br>+ done quickly if you don't care for the future<br>- completely NOT future-proof<br><br>What you *want* is a solid modular system<br>- takes quite a while before you're even going to see something that will remotely look like your end-goal, rather you'll be spending ages on small components. Not because each component is hard to code, but because each component has to be autonome and independent! And it's soooooooooo easy to ruin that, to make dependent objects that somehow are related (codewise or datawise) to your end-goal.<br>+ you may have guessed by now: in the long run you can keep expanding it without much trouble.<br><br>How can objects become autonome and independent?<br>- key-rule: NO GLOBALS, EVER, ANYWHERE. Print it and stick it at the wall above your bed.<br>- everything must be self-contained, that's where object-methods/functions come in.<br>- seperate data from GUI, make 2 objects instead. There's an object with data (palettedata for example), and an object which is the GUI (a palette-editor for example). Why? You can link your 'image' to that same data, so whenever you change the data with your palette-editor, it's automagically changed for the 'image'. If you don't seperate all this you have to manually send all changed stuff to other parts that use the data. For one or two objects it's peanuts. In a year you have 30 parts that use that same data. :P<br><br>So, when you have hundreds of little independent objects you still have no tile-editor! Now comes the trick: your tile-editor app won't be 'coded', it will be connected! You just connect all those little independent objects together and they will work together. More fun? Create that same tile-editor with XML!<br><br>"Oh, but then my app is dynamic and can be modified by artists, so they won't have to bug me anymore with their annoying feature-requests!"<br><br><br>"yezzzzzz!"<br><br><br>You should try to find/download/experiment with a modular system for audio (there're plenty o' synths) and try to superimpose that way of 'connecting icons with wires to form a synth that never excisted before' to code/apps!<br><br><br><br>Ok, enough with the brainwasing :P <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
