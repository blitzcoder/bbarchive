Pirates are also generally above skill of your best legit users. This means that anything any of your legit users can do, the pirates can do too, probably better. There are no security methods that can stop dedicated pirates/hackers. You *might* be able to dissuade causal pirates *sometimes* with incredibly invasive measures, but this will annoy your legitimate users more than it will stop piracy. The end result is that unless you can afford a HUGE investment in anti-piracy development/licensing AND you don't mind pissing off legit users you can't really dent piracy, and you will cost yourself legit users and raise your support costs as well so even then it's not worth it. Here's some examples.<br>Ubisoft employs very restrictive DRM on their games. The result is people boycot their PC sales, and the pirated versions that have the DRM stripped are usually available a week before the legit version... result, huge cost, pissed off users and VERY active pirates.<br>Personal experience: One of my iPhone projects has licensed components that cost us money for every user that installs the app. As a result we HAVE to be proactive about anti-priacy since every pirate costs us real world money, not just a "lost sale" (which is not a real thing IMO). Apple has crazy tight DRM and a cohesive store, and it's trivially easy to make a legit purchase and a hassle to pirate something, but we still send about 3 DMCA take down notices to piracy sites every single day. That's a lot of time spent finding distribution sites and contacting them every day. And there's jack squat we can do about torrents and other distributed things. It's a loosing battle, and it costs a lot of time and energy. Don't try to play that game unless you HAVE to, and are willing to commit AND you know you'll never win. We do it because we have to mitigate losses or the project would turn un-profitable. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The server and the program must also store this new special code.<br><br><br><br><br>Now, if a pirate distributes an activation key, and perhaps the special code as well, it won't do any user of that pirated version any good.<br><br>Since the special code changes with every use of the program with that activation key, nobody else can use a pirated activation key.<br>Since there is no way to tell how many times a certain activation key has been used, there is no way to predict the special code needed to get the pirated version working with that activation key.<br>The server just won't respond with a new special code and the pirated version stops working.<br><br>This approach will always need an internet connection though, or the program won't work.<br>But nowadays, there will not be many people without an internet connection anyway.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
