But I'd really like to see someone with a lot more gray matter than me come up with as near perfect a solution for this as possible. Some suggestions:<br><br>1) The BMax commands for creating GUI elements and receiving events, etc. should be the same on all supported platforms. Cross-platform portability is the main reason a lot of us bought Bmax, so catering to Windows only or Mac only will only split us apart!<br><br>2) The windows and other GUI elements themselves should be 'proper' native OS GUI elements, rather than Max-created elements. Some people may not agree with this (and maybe they have good reasons), but I think BMax will get a lot more respect if it does it this way. Plus, it will almost certainly be easier since most of the hard work has already been done by Microsoft, Apple or whoever!<br><br>3) Supporting OS-specific events, gadgets (sorry, that's what I call 'em), etc should also be possible, of course, through some clever means. Any ideas? Naturally, the features that ALL of the supported OSes share should be the common base. I could be wrong, but I'd guess that 90% or more of these features are shared already by these OSes. Afterall, are they not all event-driven pre-emptive multitasking operating systems that use graphical elements such as buttons, windows (Microsoft calls EVERYTHING in the gui a 'window' practically), menus, etc to interact with the user?<br><br>4) Along with the GUI module, I'd really like to see, of course, a Visual Designer (oops, I think that's PureBasic's area) or whatever GUI editor to top things off.<br><br>So far, I'm just having fun experimenting with BMax's 2D  capabilites. But application programming is also on my mind, and BMax seems open enough to handle it with 'gusto' &lt;crosses fingers&gt;.<br><br>Russell <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This is a possible feature of my preproc.<br><br>Russel:  this has been discussed before.<br>1) Of course.

For GUI, personnaly, I'd prefer two methods, one my own and one from this python native gui thing.  My own is that in the abstract classes there are fields (properties, actually - MARK - GUI MODULE WILL NEED THESE TO BE ELEGANT), that give info on sizing of conrols, dimensions, etc.  This will allow you to position cross platform, but it requires quite a bit of coding on the user side.  Other positioning methods can be built upon this.  For instance, the python thing's gui system was to define a window like an html table, and place a control in each data area.  Not html ofcourse but it was like html.  It was reasonably easy.  The editer for my method could be where you say, define all components as attaching to other components, with a certain pixel distance between them.  this sounds limiting, but it is for the most part how the VS2005 gui editer works for the most part and it is VERY convenient because all your stuff is lined up and neat.<br><br>4) see 3<br><br>Anyway, it'd be nice to carry the gui discussion to another thread.

Once you get into 'private', you start thinking about things like 'friend/package' and  'protected'.<br><br>However, I now consider 'Include' to be the solution to 'friend/package', and 'protected' to be bad practice anyway!<br><br>* Overloaded functions:<br><br>These are tricky. The idea is nice, but there are several 'gotchas'. For example...<br><br>Function T( x:Float )<br>End Function<br><br>Function T( x:Double )<br>End Function<br><br>T 10 'what gets called?

Blitz's 'relaxed' attitude to type conversions also complicates things.<br><br>* Properties:<br><br>I have never used these myself by I must admit to not being 100% happy with the idea of simple assignments or variable usage doing 'magical' things behind my back. I like to think that:<br><br>x.y=10<br><br>...will always take constant time to execute and have no 'side effects'. With properties, this is no longer true.<br><br>The situation is vaguely similar to classic basic style arrays, eg:<br><br>a=x(10)   'how fast will this be? Is x() a func or an array?<br><br>...vs...<br><br>a=x[10]   'this *will* be fast!<br><br>...all of which is not to say that overloaded functions or properties will never happen, just that I have reservations about them.<br><br>* GUI module:<br><br>We are working on a gui module, but there is absolutely no release date or hard info available as yet.<br><br>The big issue with a GUI module (which relates to the infamous lack of 'GetKey') is a nice event handling system. <br><br>There are many solutions to this, like Win32/BlitzPlus's global message queue (not so nice), TrollTech's 'slots and signals' (nicer) and ObjectiveC's dynamic messaging (nice) but we haven't decided on anything concrete yet.<br><br>* Getting rid of Framework:<br><br>There will always be a need for something like Framework. Consider:<br><br>p=LoadPixmap( "mypixmap.png" )<br><br>A super smart compiler (although none I know of) could theoretically figure out to only link with the PNGLoader module, but...<br><br>p=LoadPixmap( Input$() )<br><br>...would really be forced to conservately link with all pixmap loaders, which wont always be what you want. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you want properties then write accessor methods( getXXX / setXXX) and access your member variables through them.  <br><br>I have seen mention that Java supports Properties... there is a Properties class, but that is not the same thing.  Java allows you to make private member variables and access them through set and get functions.  <br><br>- Overloading<br>A simple solution to the overloading problems is to come up with rules as to which variable types automatically convert and which need explicit casting.  In Java these rules are defined by if data is lost in the conversion, ex. float is not automatically converted to int, because data is lost, but an int will be automatically converted to a float, no problem because floats hold more data than ints.  So if data is lost in conversion, don't allow automatic casting and require them to explicitly cast.  If a user wants to assign a float to an int then require them to cast.<br><br>Here is Java's scheme for automatic conversion (as best I can remember):<br> char-&gt;byte-&gt;short-&gt;int-&gt;long-&gt;float-&gt;double<br><br><textarea class=codebox name="code" wrap=OFF readonly="true" rows="15" cols="80">

yI:Int = 20
xF = yI      ' OK because no data is lost in conversion

yI = Int(xF) ' Users will have to explictly cast 
' Using the code from you example
dtype:D = New D
dtype.M(yI)  '  This will call M(x:Float) because 
             '   the next largest type is float

I still think they are applicable for updating a Type which uses fields.  With current methods if you want to insure being able to add code to field setters/getters you have to make get/set methods from the start and make all fields private.  Not only ugly, this clutters up your type quite alot.  With Properties, you can simply make your class with fields and if at some point, you decide to add code to setting/retrieving a variable, you can without breaking back-compatability.<br><br>Bit of a silly example:<pre class=code>Type TGadget Abstract
 Field X,Y, Width, Height
 Field Caption$

I think its not a bad price to pay.  Also, yeah, I doubt noobs will use it much.  Most of my features - properties, overloaded members, and private members are target at diffucultys and solutions in writing modules.  I'd say that a decent variable casting scheme could be created that worked in most cases.<br><br>-Getting rid of Framework<br>Hmm. You are correct, mark only an uber compiler could figure that out.  Maybe an interpreter XD... It would be possible to code for special cases but this isnt really the greatest idea.  Perhaps in release mode, though, only include the necessry modules, no matter if it can't figure out exactly which in that specific case. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
