If you could read the file in more of a sequence or optimized for consecutive sections being read I think that would possibly be better than jumping around a lot. `Seek time` is a harddrive issue and once you've `sought` you ideally want to just read as much as possible. Hopefully your file would not be too big as to be scattered all over the place on the harddrive. It would depend slightly on which o/s you are on, like MacOS does some automatic defragmenting when you use the system installer.<br><br>I would think you'd want to examine what scenario you are going to use this data for and how much random access such a scenario will entail, like if you are paging sections of landscape or mesh data, it may be beneficial to store `areas` in a single stream and then within that stream only have a few sub-areas to seek for.<br><br>One thing to consider is if you have multiple streams that means probably multiple files which means scattered data which means longer seek times, unless you're thinking to have multiple streams to the same file (is that possible?)<br><br>You would have to do some tests to check the speed, and ideally threading would be really helpful here, but the file i/o stuff is mainly done by the o/s so it should be pretty quick and not too hindered by Max itself. Also you have to factor in things like disk caches and stuff. It's obviously been done, like in the megatexture system, so it is doable, but I would probably approach it by trying to stream approximately the same amount of data per frame and make sure to spread out the upload as thinly as possible given the amount of time you have to load or save it. Ideally you want to save/load just a small chunk of data per frame if possible. Given that we don't really have cross-platform threads yet, you'll probably want to sort of `manage` the streaming yourself, ie loading a few chunks per frame, rather than just let some stream thread run in the background. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
