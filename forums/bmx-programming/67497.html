First off, nobody in their right mind is going to resize an array by continually slicing it to be one element larger. In this case, you're doing iterations (50,000) worth of mem copies, each one larger than the last (since the array is now larger.) Secondly, there's no need to clutter up the stack with the local Alength when you can just go <br><br>Array= Array[..Len(Array)+1]<br><br>Of course - as I said, that test is still flawed because nobody should ever use slicing that much. A more accurate test would - on each iteration - create a new array of some size - say, 500 elements - fill it with data and then slice it ONCE to a larger size, say 2000 elements. Then you can divide the elapsed time by the # of iterations and get the approximate amount of time a single slice (of a known size) took. <br><br>Lastly, the test that you have labeled "Creating the array by initializing it's size first" is not timing the creation of the array at all, but is instead timing the amount of time it takes to initialize an already created array of 50,000 elements. This might just be a semantics issue - I'm not sure what you were trying to test here.<br><br>I'm not trying to harp on you as I always like to see the pro's and con's to different methods - it's just that inaccurate tests are worse than no tests at all. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Also if people keep writing sloppier and less efficient code as CPU's get faster, there is no point having a faster CPU. The CPU speed is cancelled out by the bloated inefficiencies which is why today we have radically faster machines than 10 years ago which in some cases can barely provide the same functionality at the same speed due to such inefficiency and complexity. I prefer to still look to saving memory use, disk space and cpu time. I think it is time well spent regardless of what statistics say. I think of it more like `polishing` the code into a more beautiful work of art, than simply the technical merits or speed/space benefits.<br><br>As to the arrays, maybe they are lists of arrays in some fashion, although I don't really see provision for that in the array sourcecode.

Because of the locking thing? What is the purpose of that? Isn't a bank just a `wrapped` chunk of memory? Also accessing the bank using poke/peek is slower since you have to pass the bank ID with every call. <br></div>Well yes, except to the slower bit, because I would keep a pointer to the start of the bank. <br>But, I dont now think that a "Bank" is automaticaly better than allocated memory. I would probably still try a bank first. But would now also concider just memory. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But then, BRL's modules themselves use a lot of mem alloc that doesn't use banks so I don't quite see how that's consistent. Allocating memory gives you a pointer to the base of it, which you pass in order to free the memory, so I am presuming that pointer must NOT change otherwise not only would you write to random memory and cause a crash, but you'd not be able to free the memory? Unless Blitz keeps track of its reallocated pointer internally? I don't know. I think I will still aim to use memory rather than banks if not just because you don't need the extra fields/data to store the bank object and the bank base pointer separately. Or.. if there is good reason to use the bank, for safety reasons, maybe I'll consider it.<br><br>Speaking of pointer access, I guess it's okay to do myarray[15,20] to access a multidimensional array but you're not allowed to do mypointer[15,20] as a way of accessing memory (because it doesn't know how wide your rows are?) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
