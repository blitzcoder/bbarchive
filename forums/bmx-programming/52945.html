So does that mean you could say get DirectX library and it work?<br><br>Does the OpenGL have shader support?<br><br>Did he improve the sound library so you can pause and play sound. Understanding rewinding effect might be asking for too much. I mostly did graphics programming in Blitz3D, but it seemed like the sound didn't have an option of controlling where you want the sound wave to start or end or gettin info on where the sound is currently(like half way through or something). Can you now? Can you say "PlaySound(Sound, Millisecs)" <br><br>Does it have pretty solid documenting on OpenGL commands?<br><br>What IDE have you found to be solid for BlitzMax/Blitz3D? <br><br>I use windows XP.<br><br>Thanks Guys. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Have anyone used them with arrays?<br>You can create a pointer for Modules right? <br></div><br><br>Arrays, Strings and any custom types are always passed around by reference (ie. they use a pointer behind the scenes), so it is not necessary to use pointers with them.  This is handy for some functions though as you can use them to return multiple results from a function.<br><br>A module is not like a custom type, it is basically a collection of existing code.  This is somewhat like the old 'include' command, except that the code in the modules is only compiled once and thereafter linked into your project's code.  BlitzMAX can generate very small executables as a result (I think the smallest is something like 60KB) if you don't include modules that your code doesn't need.<br><br>Function pointers do have their uses, although I haven't had to use them that much.  In languages like C they are useful for designing programs in an object-orientated way, but BlitzMAX has much of that built into the language.<br><br><div class="quote"> Does it have pretty solid documenting on OpenGL commands? <br></div><br><br>Documentation for OpenGL is widely available, so BlitzMAX doesn't provide its own documentation for them.

I'm just talking about creating an Object and grabing it's address something like in C++.  <br></div><br><br>Modules and DLLs are similar yes - both are just libraries of compiled code. The difference is that DLLs can be loaded and unloaded at runtime.  Modules are "attached" to the rest of your code when BlitzMAX builds your executable (ie. at compile-time)<br>You cannot "grab a pointer to a DLL" either.  <br>You CAN however get a pointer to a function inside a DLL, or a pointer to a function inside a module.<br><br>In terms of creating an object and getting its address, there really is very little need to do this in BlitzMAX.  For example, if you have this BlitzMAX code to create a list:<br><br><pre class=code>
myListObject:TList=new TList
</pre><br><br>Then 'myListObject' is actually just a reference (ie. a pointer) to the list object.  If you pass it to a function, all that actually gets passed is the address of the list object in memory.  This also applies to strings and arrays in BlitzMAX.<br><br>The advantage of course over C++ is that it is harder to make silly mistakes in BlitzMAX. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I was just deciding if i should go back to C++.  Like you said tho, silly mistakes are fewer in BMX, but i have C++ right now and it is free for me.  I haven't programmed in it for a while though.  I'm a college student right now and I don't have alot of time to be messing around with syntax issues and learn API.  i'm just interested in game programming in the since of graphical, sound, collision and AI programming.  I'll learn how to work Windows APIs in my classes i'm guessing. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

C++ is too rigid a language. As a comp.sci mayor, you must have read Frederick P.
