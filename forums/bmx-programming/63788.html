Here are some thoughts:<br><br>1)  I've been a max Customer for about a year and the default IDE is not better than the day I bought the product.<br><br>2) There are a lot of third party plugins.  However, many of them don't seem to be updated any longer.  For example, IGLASS.<br><br>3) The Max language does not support some of the basic object oriented aspects.  For example, private member variables and methods.<br><br>4) Still no idea of the 3D module.  Although, it doesn't seem like it will be as compatable as Blitz3D from what I've read.<br><br>5) You can not reverse engineer the code into UML because the language is not supported by any of the UML products.<br><br>6) Memory management seems to have a lot of issues if handled incorrectly.  For example, if a points to b and b points to c and c point to b; then if I kill a the memory will not be freed.<br><br>7) All the debuggers the I have used are slow and not very good.<br><br>On the other hand there are a lot of good points that I'm not going to type.  I guess I more interested in what people feel will be done in the next 6 months to a year.<br><br>Also, if anyone has used PTK?<br><br>Thanks<br><br>PS:  This is not meant to be a negative post at BRL.

It doesn't do it for you. Having said that, last time I checked the GL implementation, it was still wrapping every single draw operation in a glbegin glend pair, so that's not optimal for batching. Also, it checks for state changes automatically,whether you want it to or not. It doesn't rebind the texture every operation, but it does check to see if it should, which is all more time wasted if you've written yourself a nice, optimized render loop. I proposed a simple, elegant solution to this over a year ago and it was completely ignored so it was either a really stupid solution or they're not really bothered about optimizing the rendering.<br><br>This doesn't really bother me as I plan to write my own 2d engine soon, which will support proper batching, compressed textures and a few other little things that Max2D doesn't do as I would like. I haven't yet decided if I'll write it from scratch or write a module around something else, but adding a nice 2d engine to Max really isn't hard. In fact, I briefly considered writing a module for PTK, but it's quite expensive and considering the complete lack of interest in my HGE module, when HGE is free, I figured people weren't going to be falling over themselves to buy PTK, so my wrapper wouldn't be much use to anyone. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'd also want a better way of organizing the batch rendering than HGE offers. Batching is really important, and if it's going to be a major feature of the engine, I would want to do it in a way that makes it as simple to use as I wanted it to be in BMax.<br><br>I'll have to have a look this week and see how much work it would be, how much interest there would be, how much time support and documentation would take and how cheap I could afford to make it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

And once you were there and have been doing that for a while, did you also notice that a makefile and the command line tools usually are everything that you -really- need?

You paid $80 for a framework to write games. The DX/GL drivers alone would have saved you that money in time it would have taken to write them. <br>Again, it's all about personal opinion and circumstances. <br>$80 is a couple of nights heavy drinking so Bmax got it's money back the first weekend I stayed in with it.<br>On the other hand, I don't ever see myself releasing anything so there's no pressure to 'polish'. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
