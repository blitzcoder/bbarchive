Then I guess based on their destinations meaning IF they have a destination based on their logic, they will call the methods which transit them to their destination :)<br><br>I have been wondering how to properly control who gets the destinations, because if I have many alien races, all of their ships can't each do what the other is doing. <br><br>So I've been wondering I can separate the ships into lists, and then for which ships I want to do X, use for eachin loops on them.<br><br>But instantly that seems to me never ending lines of code if I had hundreds of ships running around. Suppose I just want to give individual ships something to do and I have 1000 individual ships in the world. A list would contain one item, or I'd make that ship particularly like PirateShip1:tenemyship and then give pirateship his job.<br><br>What about giving a couple different ships jobs, but in different areas. <br><br>Just wondering what I am not thinking of, to limit excessive micro management of the AI ships, while still creating something which feels like their is activity around. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

What conditions one is going through has nothing to do with another. <br><br>Two ships, one under attack and one not. Once the ship realizes its under attack, it takes certain steps calls certain methods. While the other one not under attack, has no need to break from its routine.<br><br>This is just accomplished by using self can it not be?<br><br>So the methods are in the type.<br><br>ActivateDefense()<br><br>if othership nearby<br><br>if hostile<br><br>self.shields = true<br>self.weaponsystem = true<br><br>self.Defend() // where defend() is a series of routines for fighting, how fast to go, when to slow down where to maneuver etc.<br><br>Based on what I said, does this gel with what you told me?

Rather build a palette of <i>simple actions</i> that I can use to build these complex behaviors.<br><br>Such simple actions: move, stop, shoot, jettison cargo and many more. It's easier to come up with these actions if you think of yourself inside the ship's cockpit: <i>what can you do with the ship with just the controls in the cockpit</i>?<br>Because that's what an actual pilot would be doing, in the end. He makes the ship do actions; it's the string of several actions that is interpreted as behaviour.<br><br>When you have a list of these actions then you can proceed to build states: <br>Patrol would be the sequence of actions: "move to A, move to B, move to C, repeat."<br>Transport would be: "move to cargo, pickup cargo, move to A, jettison cargo, repeat".<br><br>Then you can have a single update function for each ship: self.Update(), with a huge Select statement that has several code blocks for each possible state the ship can perform. <br>Each state analyses the context in which the ship finds itself and calls the appropriate actions. For instance, if while patrolling the ship encounters an enemy then the patrolling state changes from itself to an attack state, with the target being the enemy, until the enemy escapes or is destroyed and the ship goes back to patrolling. <br>Now I just realized that states have hierarchies (destroying\attacking enemies has priority over patrolling), and that adds another layer of complexity... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
