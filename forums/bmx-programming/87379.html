You probably expect too much or something completely wrong from TCP.  TCP tries to ensure that the sent data arrives at its destination complete, in the right order and without duplicates. That's the definition of the word "reliable" in telecommunication. However, that does NOT cover latency or timeout issues or broken connections between the server and the client. TCP is a so-called layer 3 protocol; your app runs on OSI layer 7 - two heavily interacting but otherwise strictly separate worlds.<br><br>Your client app probably crashes for a bunch of reasons and most likely those crashes happen because your app is written in a way as if it was always connected to a local network, preferably without any bottlenecks and at speeds beyond 1 Gigabit. I don't want to be harsh here - it's just that this is the most common issue with client/server apps. Almost all Java enterprise applications suffer from such problems.<br><br>The problem is, when you connect through the Internet, you -will- have latency issues, packet losses and a ton of other things that will make each session unpredictable. Does your client app cover any of these things? How do you handle such errors in your app?<br><br>For example, what does your client app do when a connection time outs because it did not receive a reply on time and therefor believes the connection to the server has dropped?<br><br>Or what happens when a transmission takes too long because of a bottle-neck somewhere between your client and your server? TCP might ensure that your transmission does reach its destination, but what does your app do with a transmission that is completely out of context?<br><br>Try connecting to PCs with each other over a null modem cable and use a connection speed of 9600 BAUD or less. How does your app run in this scenario? What happens when you pull the cable during a transmission? <br><br>When you're on a LAN, what happens when you have a Firewall running on the client? Or when you use port-redirection? <br><br>What happens when you have one of the notorious "ping-pong" router issues on your LAN? (That is when because of a misconfiguration of the used routing protocol, one packet goes the right way and the next packet gets lost on the wrong way to the destination.)<br><br>Is your client more reliable when you connect to the server through a VPN tunnel?<br><br>In any case: Good luck! :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
