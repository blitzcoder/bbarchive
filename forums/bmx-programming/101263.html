It can be done; fundamentally all you need to do is allocate the object using malloc and fill it out in a pattern that matches any other class; you'd then be able to instantiate it using the reflection commands as you would with a hardcoded class. You can find the definitions of class structures in the BRL.Blitz module if I recall correctly.<br><br>However, if you want to do things like this, you're seriously using the wrong language. You should look into JavaScript, Lua, Python... something that actually supports dynamic programming. BlitzMax isn't designed to work this way; other languages are.<br><br>Anyway it's quite rare even in highly dynamic languages to actually create new classes at runtime, because usually that means you wouldn't have any statically known way to use them (if you had to create it you don't know what methods it supports). 99% of dynamic class use cases can be served equally well or better by static interfaces instead (not a native BlitzMax feature, but you can find a hack-around <a href="/posts.php?topic=100385" target="_blank">here</a> - still not how Max was designed but it's much closer in spirit; or use Monkey which supports them natively).<br><br>You might also find you can factor your dynamic behaviour down to a set of function pointers or delegate objects that can be put into statically structured wrapper objects, for a much simpler and more streamlined approach (creating completely new things inside reflection is a bit pointless because it introduces a lot of bumph you don't need on top of the dispatch system). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You can view the structures of everything in BRL/Blitz/object.h if I recall correctly. Class pointer is at the start of the object header (eight bytes before the beginning of an object); vtable begins from class[4]. You could also try just replacing the constructor of the old class with that of the subclass, if all objects will belong to one group or the other and their lifetimes won't cross the advised/non-advised boundary.<br><br>It should be possible to do this without any JIT (dynamic machine code generation) as long as you want it to be on a per-class basis; you can probably do something like extend the class with a subclass that wraps around the methods, and then swap the vtable to the subclass at runtime.<br><br>Definitely going to build a proper AOP framework next time I'm able to use BlitzMax.

So that array vfns isn't an object referenced in the last field of the struct - it <i>is</i> the last 32 fields of the struct, accessible by number. The same block of memory starts at super and carries seamlessly on right to the end of the vfns array.<br><br>2) Because of this, the actual function vtable begins <i>before</i> vfns - the New, Delete, ToString, Compare and SendMessage methods - you can see them there by name - appear before the numbered fields because, since they're part of the root Object type's signature, we know they'll always be there so may as well not mess around. They're really to be considered part of the array (the _reserved_ functions are in case Object ever got more methods - it has room for three extensions without breaking the offsets of existing compiled Max code).<br><br>3) C doesn't check array accesses are within bounds. That means the 32 there is likely unconnected to the actual size of a class object - create a bigger class and you can go on accessing elements of vfns as long as there's space to index into.<br><br>( 3.5) The actual accesses are of course being done by Blitz-generated machine code, but C is defining the protocol to use. )<br><br>4) On x86, every field of that struct and element of vfns has size 4, which is the same as a Blitz Int. So if you get the class pointer, convert it to an Int Ptr, you can get each element by its simple field position! So to get ctor, use class[4], to get ToString, use class[6], and to get vfns[3], use class[15].<br><br>5) Because all classes are allocated statically, all normal method offsets are known and there is no need for the class object's size to be recorded anywhere. This means to allocate new classes or to read all fields from an existing class, you'll need to compute its size. You can probably use reflection to get its method count and go from there. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

C function pointer syntax is <i>weird</i> (putting the name in the middle of the declaration...), and for any declaration more complicated than that most people just give up and use typedefs. There's a handy utility to translate C declarations to plain English (and English to C, actually) at <a href="http://cdecl.org/" target="_blank">http://cdecl.org/</a><br><br>Although C proper doesn't define this, note also that on x86 all pointers are the same size and don't carry any metadata - this means that you can freely convert between different function pointer types and also void* (in fact, this is exactly what you've already been doing in BlitzMax with Byte Ptr). So the fact that vfns is declared as an array of void* doesn't affect the machine code at all and the method pointers placed there - of many different Max types - will work normally, because they're just code addresses. Similarly the reserved method slots could end up taking any arguments later on. I expect Mark declared vfns as holding void* simply because it's shorter and none of those methods will ever be called from C anyway so it doesn't need to care.<br><br>The named methods on Object are declared in full (proper names and types) so that they can work correctly with the C code in the runtime which manipulates Object, not because the generated Max code needs to see that stuff. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
