You can add logic as to whether the player bothers to get there, walks, runs or whatever, that's a player profile decision and probably factors in stamina too.<br><br>When the ball is in the same or adjacent zone then the player needs to switch over to a more active system where it makes decisions based on which player has the ball, if it's a friendly player and a defender - move up the pitch, if it's a friendly player and a midfield and the player is also a midfielder - move out to the side...  Well your knowledge of football beats mine here, but something like that anyway.<br><br>Failing that, just make one look like 'Becks' and give the human player a baseball bat - because I owe that guy some payback for making me cringe whenever someone can't be bothered to use my full name. *shudder* <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

My pitch is split into 9 segments, so you could just use a 2 dimensional array [9,2]. Say the ball is in segment 4 then read [4,1] for the x position and [4,2] for the y position. Then move the player towards that location. <br><br>With this system you will tend to get player sitting still in one position for too long then suddenly charging off when the ball changes segments. It looks unrealistic if a player stands in the exact same place for more than a few seconds. You could of course break the pitch into more segments but I decided to do 2 things to combat this. <br><br>1) Find the coords of the centre of the segment, then work out how far the ball is offset from this. Then offset the player's desired location by the same amount (without leaving the pitch). You can see this at work in my tactics editor by dragging the ball around its current segment.<br>2) Make the player move randomly around his desired location.<br><br>I actually implemented the tactics system after I had a single player responding to joystick input. That way you can make sure that a player accelerates at the right rate, has momentum, tires out depending on distance run/stamina and so on. As you're making a management style game it may not be useful that way. Depends if you are animating the players or going for the FM style counters, i guess.<br><br>Hope that helps. :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Rather than have 9 segments just use 1 and find the offset of the ball from the cetre of the pitch. Then move all the players based on their formation. This loses some of the fine tuning you can have with the 9 segments, such as wingbacks getting as far forward as the opponent's penalty area, or players breaking from the centre of the pitch to the wing and so on, but I imagine these kinds of instructions could be set for individual players in your team screen. It's something I will play with in the coming months. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This was in Blitz3D so I dropped what little I had when Max came along, but I had pretty much decided by then that I wasn't going to pursue it any longer.<br><br>When you look into it, it's not just NSS3 and Sensational Soccer that break the pitch up into segments. Sensible Soccer did it, Championship Manager built its entire third game upon it, and Football Manager 2007 still uses it under the hood, albeit in an ineditable format.<br><br>As such, I'm planning to use the same system as "step one" of the whole AI process, just as a means of maintaining the basic, solid shape before each player starts to consider his surroundings and the situation at hand. Much like Championship Manager I'll be using two separate sets of coordinates, one for having possession, one for without.<br><br>Everything after that should, in theory, be down to the player AI and tactical instructions, deciding if he should sit further back to cover a gap, close down the player in possession or make a driving run into space.<br><br>I expect to be starting work on the match engine next Monday at the latest, so I might just pop in and out of this thread with my thoughts. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
