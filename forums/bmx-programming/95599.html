The scenario we're trying to perform is this:<br><br>• Use LoadBank() to download an .ogg file from an HTTP server [works]<br>• LoadSound() the TBank into a TSound<br>• Playback the TSound with PlaySound<br>• Download a new .ogg file from same HTTP server, LoadBank() it, LoadSound() it, stop playing the last sound, and then start playing the new sound<br><br>This works fine for when the code fetches the first song from the server, converts the TBank to a TSound, and plays back the song fine. However, when clicking the "skip" button to advance to the next song, on Win7 64-bit it crashes on LoadSound( via DirectSound it crashes in 'CreateSoundBuffer' / DSASS , and via FreeAudio it crashes in fa_CreateSound). On Mac OS X v10.6 instead of crashing, it gets to the PlaySound command, but never starts playing the song. Calls to ChannelPlaying() indicate that there is indeed nothing playing.<br><br>Things of note:<br><br>• I hypothesized that perhaps the audio wouldn't play the second time (Mac) because I had called StopChannel. I tried re-allocating an audio channel between song plays (using AllocChannel()) and the same problem persists<br>• I would like to debug where exactly the program is dying, but once it enters C++ code, it looks like MaxIDE stops being able to follow it in the debugger. I'm not sure how to get around this ---I can run a separate debugger, but then putting breakpoints in (BlitzMax &amp; C++ side) gets complicated (or at least I haven't figured out how to successfully debug BlitzMax apps w/ a 3rd party, non-IDE bound debugger)<br>• We're using multithreading. I was afraid calling loadSound on the non-main thread would cause drama, so all LoadSound/PlaySound calls happen on the main thread<br>• We're using the BlitzMax audio drivers that ship with BlitzMax (e.g. OpenAL, FreeAudio, and DirectSound). No MaxMod2 here.<br>• We're using the twrc.rjson JSON parsing module<br><br>Here are some images of the crash:<br><br>The FreeAudio crash (Win 7/64-bit)<br><img src="http://cyluz.com/misc/freeaudio_crash.png"><br><br>The DirectSound crash (Win 7/64-bit)<br><img src="http://cyluz.com/misc/directsound_crash.png"><br><br><br>Any help would be greatly appreciated.

</pre><br><br>A few questions:<br><br>• Are there any major caveats for LoadSound()/PlaySound() when used in a multi-threaded environment?<br>• Does (multi-threaded) garbage collection affect this in any way? (I think as of our last build we were manually GC-ing every 5 seconds)<br><br>We're getting pretty desperate since not being able to play audio w/o crashing has indefinitely halted development. We're building an angel-backed MMO in BlitzMax/MiniB3D that requires multi-threading and dynamic audio. So far the debugging limitations of MaxIDE are hurting our productivity (we're getting crashes in places that we can't step into w/ MaxIDE's debugger). I'm not sure if this is that type of thing that can be diagnosed without reviewing all the code. Makes me more excited to switch to pure C++ for the next version so that I can at least debug things more effectively, but getting things to work in BlitzMax is our goal for now (and what I'd prefer).<br><br>If there's anyone who would want to take a deeper look at our project and help out, we would love to hear from you. We pretty much just need to get a solution for this and fast.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Jason<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I would consider a second .exe (or a process can clone itself) that pulls and stores the sound files onto a temporary storage device. You are better protected when your stream throws exceptions and you aren't handing BlitzMax such complex tasks.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

For example, I can lock and unlock a mutex fine, but I can't use any of the semaphore/signal broadcasting functions (none of them work properly, at least in my experience). We've managed to work our way around this though, as we need to do HTTP requests in the game and can't do those on the main thread without slowing down gameplay.<br><br>I'd be curious to here more why you'd recommend against it, and what workarounds have you found that are a) high-performance, and b) cross-platform (we're targeting Macs and Windows)<br><br>Thanks,<br>Jason <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
