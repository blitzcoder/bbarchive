This means I can just create another function, addhook it, and it automagically works. Help-description is also done IN those functions, so these texgen functions are really stand-alone. Ofcourse they do have access to the texgen core so they can access the image buffers (which are only mem, not really an imagebuffer like a pixmap) and some core functionality like drawing boxes, rects, bresenham lines, individual pixels, etc. (note that it can draw these things over the edges, it's all wrap-around)<br><br>current textures include:<br><br>Clear<br>Filled Box<br>Pixel<br>Horizontal line<br>Vertical line<br>Bresenham Line<br>Bezier line<br>Openbox<br>Draw VectorGFX (wireframe style, based on a given definition)<br>Horizontal lightrays<br><br>and modifiers include:<br><br>Diffuse<br>TopLeftRelief<br>SetChannels<br>Invert<br>Intensitymove<br>Dither<br>Bittrunc<br>ChannelCopy<br>Blur<br>ChannelShift<br>Block<br>Tile<br>Sinedistort<br>SinedistortRGB<br><br><br>On the todo:<br>Perlin noise<br>Anti-aliased line<br>Vertical lightrays<br>Image copy<br>Indexed color<br>Exporters for non-bitmap formats<br><br>Whatever comes up in my mind -it will never bloat the code, as each function works on its own-<br><br>The whole (ascii-)script is compact, can be stored as a string in your code, so in the end one can create images without the need to incbin media.

It's a bit like a high level operating system. Upon its foundation I'll be able to make GUI's, games, applications, graphics/animation programs, etc.. all sorts of things. I'm making it as highly flexible and to have as much potential freedom as possible. You can think of it as a game editor, or an IDE, or a development environment, or a game or an application, or whatever.<br><br>It doesn't have to be used for games but it will provide good features to allow for realtime interactivity and to create and edit games and their resources. The main focus to begin with will be 2D but I aim to also branch out into 3D. It will include a cool networking system and support for collaborative editing/interaction. Since the core of it is really quite simple, kind of like a kernal in an operating system, everything built on top of it will be editable - in realtime while it's executing.<br><br>It includes an efficient multitasking script/batch system with automatic learning. Stuff created in it can be highly object oriented but it doesn't have to be. It is also going to do a lot of graphics processing and rendering like Photoshop or a paint program since I have a strong interest in graphics, plus animation and image generation. Sort of a graphical arts and design platform. It will have a very extensive library of features and all sorts of tools will be created with it.<br><br>I think it will also support generation and editing of BlitzMax programs, but that isn't its native format and I don't intend to be compiling or interpreting Blitz sourcecode. It's BRL friendly ;-) I am thinking it will be more of a higher level game-editor-toolset-frontend for BlitzMax, although it really is a standalone product.<br><br>I hope eventually to create some really nice games, tools and applications with it, which will also serve as interactive tutorials. The sourcecode is going to be module-based and at the moment I'm working on a multidimensional linked-list module, where each link stored multiple objects and where each object has its own linked list of objects. This will form some of the foundation of the object oriented design and allows for almost infinite design options. It also supports some of the `holographic`-like thought system that it's based on.<br><br>I might release the `platform` itself with a basic toolset as a free product and then charge for the more advanced applications and games that I write with it. I haven't exactly decided yet. I think it's going to be pretty exciting. I have some games in mind that I would like to create with it, as well as some graphics applications. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I didn't use BlitzMax that much yet, as until now I mainly program C++ code to be used from BlitzMax, rather than BlitzMax programs per se<br><br>@CS_TBL: very nice. As far as I'm concerned, you can keep on bragging. Please do it :) <br>Wait, private? Oh what a pity :( <br>OK, finally stop bragging it's like waving under my nose a candy I'll never have. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Gen1 was quite n00b, gen2 was quite nice, and I used it a lot to generate GUI-buttons 'n stuff. Gen3 was far better, but still became a mess due its size. All 3 were made with B+, and all filters were in one big Select-EndSelect. In an IDE without code-folding you can make a guess about my motivation to work with such an ugly brute.<br><br>Gen1..3 truly aren't worth releasing!<br><br>Generation 4 however is different. No huge Select construction, but a rather small engine that handles the script, sends out events, and each filter is a seperate function that has one variabele representing the engine, so that one has access to all relevant stuff.<br><br>From the start I hoped it would work out but (knowing myself) I didn't expected it to, hence I estimated it would become a big junkyard better to keep :-) . Currently tho, with over 60 textures and modifiers, things are looking fine. There's still no code bloat. Minus the primitive GUI there're about 4400 lines of code right now, over 1700 for textures, over 1500 for modifiers. And if I don't include the textures- and modifier-files then the app just works.. it doesn't do anything useful (e.g. nothing), but it works.<br><br>The nice thing is that anyone could make a filter, as there's *very little* one needs to know. Even the filter-helptext is inside the actual filter-function!<br>So, this simpleness might make it interesting for release, under the condition that users actually contribute public filters. :-) A public filter is as simple as posting the function, and nothing more. In a number of cases one might want to change some core functionality, in this case, each such core function is a method in a class.. quite simple all. What this core class does is house a few basic graphical instructions that one always needs on various places, such as drawrect, bresenhamline, drawpixel, limit, blockaverage, etc. etc. Eventually, when filters start to look like eachother it might be a good idea to thin them out and move their code to this core class.<br>Note that there're no native gfx instructions in the whole texgen, everything is just manually filling mem. The only image-related function is the ToImage method which converts a buffer to an image. So, native stuff like drawing lines and rects is all native code. This makes the whole thing quite portable even..<br><br>So, I need to soup up a number of things, optimize more, make more filters, perhaps inprove the GUI.. but I will consider a public release, as long as ppl contribute with new filters!<br><br>Its current list o' modifiers: <i><br>Diffuse '0<br>TopLeftRelief '1<br>SetChannels '2<br>Invert '3<br>Intensitymove '4<br>Dither '5<br>Bittrunc '6<br>ChannelCopy '7<br>Blur '8<br>ChannelShift '9<br>Block '10<br>Tile '11<br>Sinedistort '12<br>SinedistortRGB '13<br>Blockblur '14<br>Solarize '15<br>Max '16<br>Min '17<br>Brightness '18<br>BrightnessRGB '19<br>Sinecolor '20<br>Scanlines '21<br>Hmirror '22<br>Vmirror '23<br>PaletteMatcher '24<br>Binary8 '25<br>Diffuse8 '26<br>&lt;under construction&gt; '27<br>Limit '28<br>Rotozoom '29<br>Spherezoom '30<br>Sinestar '31<br>8M '32<br>PaletteFinder '33<br>Move '34<br>Mix '35<br>Normalize '36<br></i><br>And textures: <i><br>Clear '0<br>Box '1<br>Plot '2<br>Xline '3<br>Yline '4<br>Line '5<br>; Line2 '6 &lt;disabled&gt;<br>Bezier '7<br>Openbox '8<br>DatastreamRGB '9<br>DatastreamI2 '9<br>VectorGFX '11<br>SetStreampointer '12<br>; Rays '13 &lt;disabled<br>Hrays '14<br>; Radialsines '16 &lt;under construction&gt;<br>Randompath '17<br>MSX1palette '18<br>C64palette '19<br>C64palette2 '20<br>C64palette3 '21<br>DatastreamI1 '22<br>4PointGradient '23<br>PerlinOctave '24<br>Buffercopy '25<br>Envmap '26<br>Sines '27<br>Buffercopy2 '28<br>Buffercopy3 '29<br>Vectorlandscape '30<br>Tunnel '31<br>Light '32</i><br><br><br>ok, one more brag :P<br><br>Perlin noise<br>Tunnel<br>Light<br>Buffercopy3 (with scaling)<br><br><img src="http://pub.unreal64.net/boor/piptunnel.png"> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
