This includes a level editor and exporters.  As-is, you have no support for curved surfaces or even Source's rather neat displacement brushes (which are more or less equivalent to a curved surface) in engine or editor, so what else are you selling here?  There's no animated mesh support from what I've seen, if I recall correctly you have no exporters for popular tools (thus increasing the amount of time spent not actually producing content), and overall it's just not a very useful engine right now, given that you simply could not produce a decent game with it as-is.<br><br>Another problem is that your editor is severely underpowered for any really useful purposes I can see, so I don't see a reason to bother buying your engine when I'd have to use 3DWS (bought it back when it was expected that we'd get useful features besides primitives and mesh placement [your terrain editor is terrible]).  Considering you've more or less ceased to support the editor you can buy at the moment, save for making excuses as to why you haven't fixed bugs, why should anyone want to use it?<br><br>You need to fix up what you have now, not try to change its appearance for other people.  Your engine isn't anywhere close to being usable in a finished product and your editor is underpowered and unsupported.  Finish what you've already started instead of worrying about what a tiny, little community wants -- maybe ask people in the industry (that is the big part of the games industry that actually produces quality games) what they want, which probably isn't BlitzMax support in the first place.  They'll probably want to be able to use animations.<br><br>Now for more painkillers and some Portal. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I was very excited when your engine was anounced, and I think you've done a very very good work, but I think there are some areas that make it not complete for game desing. I'm thinking on animations (correct me if I'm wrong) and DX support on windows, appart from the usual neverending bugfixing on all young engines.<br><br>I think, in my honest opinion, that DX suport for the engine is completelly needed, and animations support obviously with tweening and the like.<br><br>Apart from this, it would be great to have more support for standarized formats, and a fixed 3D world studio license with the engine. Lighting in the 3d world studio is buggy, slow, and sometimes just hungs without any progress.

As mentioned, the day you can guarantee that it won't just bomb out on Shader 2.0 hardware (GeForce 5 and ATI Radeon 9550 and newer), call that the min specs.<br><br>And more feature complete would mean that it covers the WHOLE set of B3D features. Not just the nice to have eye candy part on which you seem to focus on.<br><br>Shadows are nice but get the art pipeline and animation working fully correctly before you go to eye candy. Right now the engine is great to showcase 3DWS levels but for doing a game it is as usefull as Nuclear Glory 3D. Eye candy for screenshot but not even alpha - beta phase capable. I would even consider Dreamotion 3D more beta phase capable, sorry.<br>(just to mention, I've an 8800GTS, a 7600 and an Intel GMA 950, all SM2 capable)<br><br>Right now the engine is:<br><br>1. Good for showcase<br>2. Good if you target non Windows system (no DX on windows is simply inacceptable for any engine. DX is the standard, OpenGL the nice to have addition if you want to have crossplattform or target nvidia. But it is crap on ATI and Intel)<br><br>3. Not good for a complete game as too many aspects that are just core aspects don't work<br>3.1 stability<br>3.2 "eye candy" bugginess<br>3.3 Art pipeline inexistant and the used main formats are not industrial standards. (ever heard of Collada? Full featured open standard should definitely be on the list of "must have or skip the launch". X and B3D are nice but both are non standard for model. OBJ, FBX and Collada and a few others are)<br>3.4 Either do an engine or an engine for an editor and bundle them. But don't build your engine for your editor and make them beeing standalone and still basing your stuff on the editors output.<br>I don't plan to get 3DWS, the export is as bugged as with CS2 (I'm part of several commercial application board mod teams and so far, 3DWS was the main reason for B3D import issues as it does not correctly implement B3D. In several cases still the same bugs posted on CS3 and CS4).<br>For that reason I don't plan to ever get 3DWS. The "self engine centric" orientation instead of making it industrial centred (check DeleD for a reference of what I mean) makes it a pricy yet quite pointless tool.<br>DIF is broken (you can't export to TGEA 1.0.3 DIF as there are no tools so you false advertise), B3D is bugged. MAP is not even specified which one of the possible MAP incarnations.<br>You better get a fully working OBJ exporter in, as we all are able to convert that to B3D or whatever we need.<br>If you ever get this kind of stuff sorted out it might be worth its money as the handling itself is quite great.<br>But the "external support" is sadly as worse as it ever has been with your editors. No actively and fully supported format support for import and export. Its always your format that is "genius" over any other format, point. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

To do it properly you have to probably start looking at raytracing or radiosity. This brings me back to the main peev I have about 3D, in general, at this time in its development: It's a work in progress and it does not look realistic. You can even throw as many shaders at it as you like, it still doesn't look realistic. Partly that's because we're all trying to use triangles which really is a generalization of shape and is not very precice even with normal maps and stuff thrown on top. Lighting still hasn't got to the point of being global radiosity with proper radiosity shadowing and we still don't have proper simulaton of light as in ray tracing. It's still going to be quite a few years yet before the general level of hardware (not just the cuttinng edge) is fast enough to do the kind of realtime raytracing which is really going to be needed to solve all or most of these problems, and with solid geometry not polygons. Meanwhile we're playing with inferior systems, inferior half-baked ways of trying to create simulations of reality, and trying to do things that are way above and beyond the real processing power available. Only when the hardware gets to the level where it can render huge scenes realistically with brute force is it really ready for consumption, otherwise we're constantly trying to minimize and reduce and cut corners and have to come up with all kids of complex algorithms to try to cut down the amount of work to be done. Those kind of solutions are not complete solutions because they add to the amount of work needing to be done, while at the same time trying to remove it. So it's all very well asking what kind of engine you want but basically the hardware cannot run the kind of engine that you really want, regardless of who creates it or how stable it is. The best we can do is half measures and fake illusions of things looking right in some situations but not always. The debate then is really about what kind of tradeoffs seem acceptable or, given the limitations, what is the best of the compromises. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You need to understand hardware, understand a fair amount of more complex algorithms to use those shaders only where needed and a lot more.<br><br>If you don't do that, you will release a visual crap like ET:Quake wars. Once hyped but was released with terrain texture quality etc that is far below anything I would pay "HD quality game price" for. Perhaps when it dropped to 20-25$ but not for 60$<br>Thats one of the games that clearly show that knowledge outperforms "ideas" (Unreal / Source vs id tech)<br>id came up with new great ways of storing stuff for quite some time but somehow they forgot to evolve in how to use the new technology.<br>And beside those and crytek there aren't that many other teams who really have a deep understanding of graphics hardware, its capabilities and its bottlenecks as it seems. EA definitely doesn't have a single team with a fully fledged idea. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
