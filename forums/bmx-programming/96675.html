A lot of stuff is not fully tested/functioning. To be honest, it is not production ready.<br><br>However, there are a number of examples in each module's doc folder. <a href="https://github.com/kfprimm/maxb3d/tree/master/functions.mod/doc" target="_blank">Here</a> are some function examples. (Many have been converted from their B3D counterparts!)<br><br>One of my primary goals with MaxB3D is to make everything as a modular/abstract as possible. A lot of the functionality that isn't specific to MaxB3D is located in my prime.mod module scope.<br><br>It is also totally object-oriented, but there is a module that provides functions, MaxB3D.Functions. I also plan to add a module to restore B3D-like functions as well, MaxB3D.Retro.<br><br>MaxB3D is totally API independent, you can actually run it without opening a graphics context! Good for a server environment.<br><br>Currently, I have an OpenGL and D3D9 driver. I will probably add a D3D11 driver as col has done the base work by writing a D3D11 module.<br><br>Also, I modelled the mesh loader system after the way pixmap loaders work. This means that someone can write a mesh loader as a module, and all users will have to do is import the module to get the functionality.<br><br>As for how is differs, the function naming convention has changed and a few other things, see <a href="https://github.com/kfprimm/maxb3d/wiki/Moving-from-Blitz3D-or-MiniB3D" target="_blank">https://github.com/kfprimm/maxb3d/wiki/Moving-from-Blitz3D-or-MiniB3D</a>. In doing this, I hope to make it feel more modern and make it a bit more flexible. For example, PointEntity now accepts an TEntity or a float array with coordinates to a location to point to. This removes the need to create a pivot, position it at the desired coordinates, pass the pivot to PointEntity, and then free the pivot.<br><br>I also have an abstract physics and shader system in place, as well as numerous other small features. However, much of these are unfinished. As a side note, the shader system is actually in prime.mod, and will eventually be usable with Max2D by itself.<br><br>In terms of functionality in comparison to others, everything else is probably much more complete. For example, B3D style collision code is in there, but it is not functioning properly. Also, I have my own 3D audio system that integrates right on top of BRL.Audio, but the OpenAL driver is not working correctly.<br><br>And Adam, I wrote MaxB3D from the ground up. There is no community! I only used MiniB3D as a reference for the GL stuff and a general idea for how to accomplish a couple of things.<br><br>If there is interest, perhaps I will try to tackle a few big issues and put out a packaged pre-release in the following week.<br><br>Otherwise, you're welcome to grab <a href="https://github.com/kfprimm/prime.mod" target="_blank">prime.mod</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kfprimm/maxb3d" target="_blank">MaxB3D</a> and give it a go yourself. <br><br>If you compile it, it will complain about needing <a href="/posts.php?topic=56469" target="_blank">PUB.MaXML</a>. The modules that need PUB.MaXML are not used by MaxB3D, so you can delete them if you wish.<br><br>Maybe some more documentation on the module would help others in the future!<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font><br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

How big of a dent do you think you can put in it in the next week? I guess I should say, percentage wise, how far along are you now on the whole package?<br><br>Also, does the Newton functionality require any extra files/dlls? I love Box2d, but of course it is only 2D...<br><br>Thanks for all of the hard work you've already done!<br>Russell<br><br>p.s. Documentation is key, also, and one of the things that can take the longest to get "right". One of the reasons I liberally, almost ridiculously, comment my code. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

A lot of loose ends need to be tied up.<br><br>I am going to try to take care of the last remaining core issues, such as picking, before a release. In any case, look for a release Friday at the latest.<br><br>On Linux, and presumably OSX, Newton is compiled directly into the executable. So nothing extra. However, on Windows, newton.dll is required. However, it is already included in the repo (I believe). For some reason I don't remember, it would throw some compile errors when building on Windows from source. I think that is because it is built (typically) with MSVC.<br><br>As a side note, in theory, Box2D could be used as a physics driver. Hmm, maybe...nah! I must avoid feature creep! Perhaps later.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Same thing could be applied to programs: At some point, we have to just say "Ok, it's finished." (and then under our breath "..for now"). ;)<br><br>I would say, don't worry too much about adding features that are outside of your project's main goal, which I presume is 3D. Besides, we already have box2D available to us and could, I assume, fairly easily use it with MaxB3D if necessary, right?<br><br>I look forward to see what you have completed on Friday!
