The assembly code emitted for obj.DoStuff() is the same regardless of whether the method is abstract, final, extended in another type or a combination of those. <br></div>Actually  GW is right : final methods can be compiled more efficiently in some situations. In his example, the instruction "t2.DoStuff" calls a final method, thus the compiler knows for a fact that if t2 actually point to an instance of a type derived from tMyType2 (rather than to an instance tMyType2), then it doesn't changes anything as DoStuff  cannot be overriden (so it can only be tMyType2.DoStuff that gets called).

There are a limited amount of registers (very little on intel CPUs) so that even if the compiler stores *some* local variables directly in registers there's always a point where it has to be stored on the stack (your saying 10, ok maybe). But the real point is that there is not just one function on the stack at one point.

Right, on the stack, so in the end the more local variables has the first function, the more it takes memory at one point.<br>And actually usually functions do not work that way, they do store local variables on the stack (only they might load their values in registers *too* at the beginning for speed purpose).<br><br><div class="quote"> That's a very good reason for giving a get/set interface to external code.

But getters and setters generally make the code much less readable - not cleaner - IMHO, unless the compiler provides some syntactic sugar for calling getters/setters as if you were accessign simple fields (ala C# properties).

The point you make about function calls is true, but that's not specific to Local variables: also intermediate values from expressions need to be stored. What I'm saying is, there's (usually) no need to minimize the number of Local variables per se. Stuffing everything into a large expression isn't going to make it any faster, as long as the algorithm is the same. On the other hand it will make reading the code a pain.<br><br><div class="quote"> And actually usually functions do not work that way, they do store local variables on the stack (only they might load their values in registers *too* at the beginning for speed purpose). <br></div><br>That depends on the compiler, I guess, but I think a Local that's only needed in the next two lines will not be stored on the stack. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
