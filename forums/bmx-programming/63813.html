There is no patent on the BlitzMax language, because it basically is a BASIC, and that language family has been around for more than forty years now.<br><br>However, you -will- run into problems when you do one of the following:<br>- Call your own product BlitzMax.<br>- Advertise it as BlitzMax or use this forum as a means of distribution.<br>- Use any part of BlitzMax´s source code or documentation for your own product.<br>- Use reverse engineered BlitzMax code for your product. (Unless you used the clean room approach, which means that one engineer reverse engineers, documents and another engineer implements new code based upon the documentation of the first engineer -- the Mono project is doing that, by the way.)<br><br>However, if I was you I would prepare myself for the fact that you are not going to make yourself friends among the BlitzMax developers for cloning their product/language. Frankly speaking, I, personally, would be quite pissed off and sue the shit out of you if you tried to take over my market.<br><br>But other than that: If your compiler runs under Mono (on Mac OS X) and supports multithreading, I will take a -close- look at it and even consider buying a licence. ;-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

And I really want to develop efficient working apps for Vista and for XP SP2, not for windows versions officially abandoned. As it was ok for BRL to go the "modern" way on Apple, I think its fair that I as Windows User want a similar support on our side as well as the largest part of user after all is Windows based.<br><br>I'm not saying current BM is bad.<br>But I feel unhappy about the fact that the Windows Version just bases too much on the stone age blitz. if I wanted stone age blitz stuff I would use my B3D further and not payed 90$ for BM and another 30$ for MaxGUI... (MaxGUI bases on Blitz Plus which was great 2-3 years ago but a bad decision for WinXP and Vista and especially an OO managed environment. the DX driver we got is DX7 which even for crap cards like Intel is a worse decision so definitely not a step toward compatibility compared to OpenGL. Thanks to a community member we have a DX9 driver which clearly shows that as it already is 30-50% faster and that thought it has not been under dev and upgrade for over a year) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

After all, they already do offer a compiler that runs on three platforms, and by that they deliver more on the multi-platform promise than Microsoft ever will with their .NET.<br><br>Now from the customers perspective: Why would you want to buy a BlitzMax licence if you can have an open source compiler for that language that is completely source code compatible? At least on the Windows platform, they will lose customers.<br><br>This is one of the greatest problems with Open Source, by the way. Eventually, somebody will always start a "free" alternative to a commercial product, and by that killing the commercial product and the company behind it. The cynical part of it being the fact that the founder of the OSS project usually won't make a living out of his work, because with OSS, you usually simply can't.<br><br>OSS is a great marketing tool for big players like IBM. For smaller companies, it can easily become their death sentence.<br><br>Sure, BlitzMax wouldn't be where it is without all the Open Source modules that it uses. (So there now is that valid question: What do the developers of those modules actually do for a living? And did anybody at least donate some money to their projects?)<br><br>But having an Open Source version of a BlitzMax compiler available can only lead to one thing: Nobody will buy the commercial version anymore unless for some reason they have to.<br><br>In any case: This is a discussion you should have with Mark Sibly and his team.<br><br>Besides those legal and political and business related issues: Make sure that it also runs on Mono, especially when you want to put it under the GPL. It would also be mega-cool if SharpDevelop and MonoDevelop would have a plugin for your compiler plus syntax highlighting. Just my first input for the wishlist. ;-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That's not contradicting myself, that's covering all the bases :)<br><br>As said, I dont have any commercial intentions for it.<br>Nomen luni makes a good point. I am not a god, certainly not when it comes to creating compilers. All I can hope for is that the performance will be at least on par with blitzmax, but I wouldn't bet on it. The only thing I want is for blitzmax to finally be able to join the huge league of development tools out there that are keeping up with modern times. If it is possible to create .NET applications with blitzmax, I am pretty sure that will serve as a very good reason for more people to use blitzmax. <br><br>But once again, it is a hobby project. It mainly serves an educational purpose for myself but it may actually become usefull to people at some point.<br><br>it is important to note that a compiler that understands Blitzmax is a very long way from something that can just compile all your Blitzmax code out of the box.<br><br>Keep in mind that a large part of the code you write is based on modules and libraries that have been specifically written for blitzmax, and many of the utilize external sources like assembler and C code.<br><br>It is not a trivial matter to make these modules and libraries available in .NET format. You can't just use them with my compiler, as they first have to exist in some .NET form. Some libraries which exist as dll's can be accessed in a .NET assembly through the Platform Invoke System, but this  still keeps it a long way from being the Game-programming language/tool that Blitzmax is at this moment.<br><br>This compiler is meant to open up the .NET framework to BlitzMax. I have no intention of rewriting the entire blitzmax codebase in .NET (that means rewriting all existing modules and stuff in a language like C# or ilasm).<br><br>To give an example of what I mean:<br>My compiler should be perfectly capable of reading/compiling this into a working .NET program:<br><pre class=code>
Import System

Function Main:Int(args:String[])
	Local myApp:App = New App;
	myApp.Run();
	
	Return 0;
End Function

Type App
	Field Running:Int
	
	Method New()
		Running = False;
	End Method
	
	Method Run()
		Running = True;
		
		Repeat
			Console.WriteLine("loop");
			
			If( Console.ReadLine() &lt;&gt; "") Then
				Running = False;
			End If
			
		Until( Running = False)
	End Method
End Type
</pre><br><br>However, the following will not work:<br><pre class=code>
SetGraphicsDriver(GLMax2DDriver())
SetGraphics(640, 480, 32)

Repeat
  Cls()
  Drawrect(10, 10, 100, 100);
  Flip()
until(KeyHit(KEY_ESCAPE) or AppTerminate())
</pre><br><br>The reason is simple: Many of the commands used here are not standard .NET library commands. Someone will have to write a library for that first. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
