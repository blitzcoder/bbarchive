I've spent some time to test a lot (and I've registered a bunch!), here is my opinion about the possible choice for BMAX as of today.<br><br>6/10 : TV3d : <a href="http://www.truvision3d.com" target="_blank">http://www.truvision3d.com</a> : the beta is hard to use because of the lack of information (need to browse the forums). The video are great, but the examples are ridiculous. The water is very very far from AAA games released 2 years ago (Farcry?) Also it is not stable, the terrain need to be re-written to be more shader friendly. Also it is more adapted to VB6, or .NET, most of the samples are written in these languages. AS of today, you cant release anything made with the BETA, and there is no final release date...Maybe in 6 months?<br><br>7/10 : Torque : <a href="http://www.garagegames.com" target="_blank">http://www.garagegames.com</a> : the shader version is going close to the final but there is still no shadows (stencil). Also Torque is made to run with the Torque script that is not fast. So if you want to do something a little bit more complicated you need to change the basic source code that is +500 000 line of code. Programming Torque is a little bit like modding HL2, but the HL2 engine is much better and free. The new terrain with Torque is mindblowing, well I can't say more because of the BETA status, but wow!<br><br>7/10 : 3Impact : <a href="http://www.3impact.com" target="_blank">http://www.3impact.com</a> : it is easy to use, and well supported by Bmax. but there is no terrain (well octree, or adaptative terrain for doing huge spaces), no water and you can't create your own shaders!!! Frustrating...<br><br>9/10 : Irrlicht : <a href="http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net</a> : nice engine, maybe the best when the new wrapper version (1.1) will be upgraded. This engine seems to be the most complete so far, it supports a lot of formats, has a great terrain engine, supports all shaders, use global shadows ...<br><br>5/10 : Renderware : <a href="http://www.renderware.com" target="_blank">http://www.renderware.com</a> : a little bit old, the tools are awful and is more designed to be used from C++ (the v 6)...<br><br>6/10 : Orgre : <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org" target="_blank">http://www.ogre3d.org</a> : too complicated so it is almost impossible to maintain a wrapper. Use too much callbacks, made to be used from C++, with inheritance and classes.<br><br>4/10 : Crystal Space : <a href="http://www.crystalspace3d.org" target="_blank">http://www.crystalspace3d.org</a> : this engine was very promising 2 years ago, since 2004 nothing interesting has happened to this engine, due to its complexity : you need 165 DLL in order to run it!!! Who want to make a wrapper for that engine?<br><br>6/10 / : C4 Engine : <a href="http://www.terathon.com/c4engine/" target="_blank">http://www.terathon.com/c4engine/</a> : this engine seems very interesting, but the license is 100 USD and you can't be signed with an editor. weird license BTW. There is a nice editor with scripting, and support for all shaders, good shadows, sound, network. Ony one small DLL seems to be the core of the engine, no one did a wrapper on it? Btw in the forums, people seems to complain about the lack of features, no LOD, no huge terrain, well it seems to be in alpha stage rather than in release as they pretend to be.<br><br>6/10 : Appocalyx : <a href="http://apocalyx.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">http://apocalyx.sourceforge.net/</a> : I've always liked this engine, because of its specific features. Flags, clothes simulation, but it can do terrain, water, and a lot of things. Now it is free and with its source code. But hard to do a wrapper on it because it uses the lua script engine.<br><br>6/10 : Nebula 2 : <a href="http://www.nebuladevice.org/" target="_blank">http://www.nebuladevice.org/</a> : promising in 2004, dead since 2005, scriptable through Tcl/Tk, Python and Lua, but not thru BMAX... in my opinion depends too much on GPL and external dependancies, too complicated to make a simple wrapper on it.<br><br>If you have experienced some engine (the reality engine?) please tell us if you think it is suitable for BMAX? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It also has good shader support but you do need to know how to program in order to use them.<br><br>SOW is a great wrapper that appart from a few niggles, if fixed it will be very like Blitz3D. Out of the Box with C++ and .Net languages ogre has a b3d like high level abstraction layer and entity system. It's a bit more complex, but feels kind of familiar in many ways.<br><br>Ogre has an extensive range of addons avaliable for it, including 5 physics API's, a couple for input, 3 networking libs, CEGUI is built in and offers a very nice efficient skinned cross platform GUI, but there is also support for WXwidgets. Opcode collision library, and various tools are avaliable. Paging landscape terrain system. a new game framework and editor, particle system editor etc.<br><br>It has the best 3dsmax art pipeline avaliable for it now that its past the early beta stage. Also support for most high end apps, Blender and Ultimate unwrap.<br><br>It's fast, and has impressive fast shadow support, 60,000 tri level with no optimization and everything casting stencil shadows ran at 25 - 30fps on my Geforce 3<br><br>I'd give ogre 7.9/10 overall, 8/10 for art pipeline if you have one of the better supported apps and basic scripting knowledge. 9.5/10 if yo use 3dsmax and ofusion. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It has no real art pipeline requiring you to juggle various formats for different needs and none of them are suitable for modern realtime 3D. B3D support that was recently added was nice, but too little too late. B3D itself is pretty outdated where materials are concerned, but is otherwise still one of my favourite formats. Especialy when compared to the alternatives, .3ds and OBJ and my3d<br><br>I think the lack of art pipeline tools let irrlicht down a lot, without vast improvements in this area it falls short.<br><br>7/10 overall 4/10 Art pipeline <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's also entirely untrue to say that all the samples are written in other languages. Kenshin has put a LOT of work into getting a whole series of samples converted to BlitzMax and he's already finished fourteen of them.<br><br>Furthermore, the BlitzMax wrapper emulates almost exactly the syntax of these other languages, so any code you find in C#, VB, C++ or Delphi can easily be converted to BlitzMax. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's great that they are the first to jump on an opportunity and open doors for indies. But their tech is always dragging behind the more modern competition.<br><br>Their art pipeline tools are pretty poor, and they rely heavily on outdated BSP technology which is great for underlying structure in an engine, but not really for visuals.<br><br>They don't address really basic graphical features and art pipeline tools. only 1 UV for DTS even in the shader engine. No fixed function materials worth a damn in either engine in either TGE/TSE<br><br>Rumours of dropped support for linuz and soon the Mac in favour of windows and 360 is cause for concern. Not cross platform for TSE anytime soon except for 360.<br><br>No entity system, and a awkward scripting language. the tools for converting maps to torque ones is always buggy. Funnily enough the one map editor that got the most acurate results was WED for 3DGS. Last time I used torques Map2Dif there was rounding off of floats, so some things wouldn't line up properly or become non convex when exported from quark, hammer, or Radiant.<br><br>terrible art pipeline, with Max plugins having barely changed in over 5 years. Things have moved on and for the most part left torque behind. Allthough having said that, finished games are being released which puts it up to the top of the list for actualy shipping games. And its the only quick path to 360 at the moment.<br><br>I've made quite a nuisance of myself on their forums, bringing up the major issues with the art side of the engine on occasion. The response is usualy, you can do anything with torque, you have the source go fix it yourself.. OK!<br><br>For support you mostly have the community and the resources they create, many of which are out of date and simply don't work without a lot of prior knowledge and recoding. There are few high level functions avaliable even in script something like rotations is a real pain, often requiring you to understand a lot of tricky math to do even simple things that you take for granted with something like blitz3D.<br><br>I rate Torque 6/10 overall, and 4/10 for art pipeline. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
