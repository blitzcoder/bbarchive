When using full namespaces you won't get intellisense, as you will be 'confusing' blide.

And making this on the same folder is dangerous becouse an eventual compilation could erase all this (great) module. Take in consideration that a class called 'Vector' can be duplicated on other modules, so a full namespace path can be sometimes needed. I hope I'll have this BLIde update tomorrow. :D<br><br>By the way, the Gui module included has no documentation, but looks very well built. Is it part of ppisaac? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

They tend to not relax completely. Is this still in development?<br><br>Joints - joint stiffness set from 0 - 1 and beyond seems to have no effect. They always squash and stretch massively. Is this buggy and still being developed?<br><br>Freeform collision hulls - the automatism doesnt cope with concave geometry very well. Will this be enhanced?<br><br>Gravity/Forces - Why is it that you need to set forces and gravity in the areas of 1000000000 to get any effect? Can you tune it better?<br><br>Thanks in advance <br><br>North <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I will rewirte the ropes code after I introduced new joint types. The new joint types are more flexible to optimise. I hope they will bring more stable ropes.<br><br>Joints:<br>The same as with ropes. In fact there is an (very small) effect. And if you use the GetStiffness Method (which uses the NewtonGetStiffness command) you get the same stiffness value. So stiffness value is set correctly, but the effect is rather minimalistic now. But as I said above, that will get better with different joint types.<br><br>Freeforms:<br>In general you can only use "convex" freeforms with Newton/ppIsaac. If you want to use correct concave collision geometries you will have to wait for compound objects which is on the roadmap too.<br>Furthermore the automatic detection command is rather simple right now and might be optimised. But first I will write a semi-automatic function to read vertex information from an image: I.e. in Photoshop create a layer with your object you want to create. In a second layer place a one pixel size dot at the position where you want to have a vertex in the coresponding freeform object. That would be at the characterisitic corners of your image. Then save this second layer to an image file. The new function scans the image for pixels and creates a vertex where it finds a pixel. In this way you have a little bit more work but more control on vertex creation.<br><br>Gravity/Forces:<br>That depends on the masses you use. But I also tend to introduce a global force factor that will be automatically multiplied with forces. Tuning is on the todo list.<br><br>Thanks for your feedback. I know there is still much work todo. <br><br>René <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
