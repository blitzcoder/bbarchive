It doesn't matter when. Spread it out if you have to. But make sure they are not kept waiting. Progress bars are awful. The word `loading` on the screen is awful. The player has no interest in nor desire to know about loading of files. It breaks the experience of the game. Always do it secretly in the background, in the dead-time while a title screen is showing, little bits at a time as your title screen fades out, whatever you can to do it smoothly and unnoticeably. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You load every level data at once (make sure it doesn't take too long... test your game with an old computer).<br><br>Having a loading screen is consistent. The player of your games will be very annoyed if the game crashes while he's playing a level because it can't find a resource or it's corrupted... and he hasn't saved the game for a while. Trust me. It's something you really don't want to deal with. ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

A loading screen is only needed for the delay caused by single-threadedly loading data and forcing the user to wait. That is not good.<br><br>I also don't see why you'd need a loading screen for `corrupted or missing resources` - why would your game EVER have missing resources, and if it's corrupted then no amount of loading screen is going to make it work, right?<br><br>This goes back to the days of floppy disk loading. Remember the game Swiv on the Amiga? Loaded one very long level as the game was being played, spooled from a slow floppy disk. The user never had to wait to play the next level. Remember the popular Shadow of the Beast on the Amiga? The user had to stop and wait for seconds while the next part loaded - quite annoying.<br><br>Forcing the user to wait for data to load is offputting. They don't `expect` it. The only reason it happens a lot is because of poor design and lack of consideration for the user on the part of many developers. It's a matter of customer service. Don't keep them waiting. If you have a loading screen and you're making the user wait to play then something's gone wrong. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It may not happen with the average indie game but sometimes you'll want to develop an open structure like allowing mods, expansion packs and even update patches. So corrupted or missing resources happen more that you can imagine.<br><br>I don't see a problem with loading screens. And the games history tells me I'm thinking coherently at least. Just look at an EA or Atari game. So do you really think that many successful titles like The Sims, Battlefield 1942, Age of Empires, Neverwinter Nights, Rollercoaster Tycoon, Still Life, etc. (and they all have loading screens between levels) are simply badly designed? They have a reason to code the games the way they do.<br><br>Now, of course, if you're trying to make a simple freeware puzzle game then you may be right. But no user will ever complain about a data loading screen. They'll only complain if it takes too long.<br><br>Just my two cents. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
