I was startled and really happy that we got multi-threading without forking out more cash which I would happily have paid.<br><br>I cannot fault Mark for his decision to do Monkey though. The thing is a subscription BlitzMax would not have gotten me into the language in the first place, if I was a youngster starting out then BlitzMax would not even be the right tool.

But, in the other hand, I love to have a tabs-based internet browser that allows me to close tabs. This is not native, but an example that shows sometimes the extra funtionality you get being not native is worth it (the multiselect tree view is a good example). Tree control implementations is very different on different OSes too, so it is a good example of why sometimes a self-generated non native component can be useful. But when you can stay native, it's usually better, as everything in the look and feel of your app is properly integrated into de OS.<br><br>When I was designing some skins for BLIde, I decided to use the system colors for the parts of the GUI that where non native, so using the defined system colors to draw buttons, tabs, etc, helped a bit to make the application GUI a bit more integrated. BLIde looks a bit different (in some skins) when used on XP with luna enabled, than when used on XP with Luna disabled, and when used on Vista or 7. Also, the fontmachine editor tool, looks different when used on Windows or on Mac (using mono).<br><br>EDIT:<br>That said there are sort of levels of "non-nativity" (sorry for the word). I have never felt "at home" with Java applications using Swing, but I feel quite well integrated with lots of QT applications. So, to say, some non native GUIs are much more native-like than others. wxWidgets can look and feel very native too, when used with this intention in mind while designing apps. So a well balanced non native GUI that brings the extra functionality you may need, preserving cross platofm nature, and allowing your app to intregrate nicelly on the potential host OSes, is a blessing. From my point of view QT is a bit like this. If you happen to need some ritch GUI for your app, it is a very very recommended option.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2013</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
