There seem to be at least three public LUA modules and I've found at least another two people who are or were writing their own LUA modules.<br><br>I'm really struggling to work out which module(s) I should be using to use LUA in BlitzMax. I'm working on a large, complex game and I don't want to get caught out using the wrong module and suffer a huge waste of time rewriting tons of stuff later. I'm really looking for all kinds of information and advice from people who are seriously using LUA. Which module(s) are you using? Why? Is one easier? Is one more feature-packed? Is one more stable/reliable? Is one more bug-free?<br><br>There just doesn't seem to be much discussion of these modules compared to 2d and 3d engines, compression modules, and these sort of things, and that makes it impossible for me to judge the relative merits of each. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

What I really want to avoid, though, is the kind of "module limbo" you're experiencing; and I wasn't sure why, in a language that is supposed to compile C (right?) you need anything sitting between your code and the LUA library. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That is, it often has the datatypes, but they're not equivalent with their C++ counterparts. For example, structs with anything but the simplest datatypes cannot be interfaced directly from BMax. You end up writing a simple wrapper ( like my TrueVision wrapper ) where you have a BlitzMax Type which mimics the struct and a series of functions which pass the struct/class instance and then operate on it as you wish. To the person using the module, they don't see any difference. They still have a class with the same methods and fields, but you end up writing a lot of intermediate code in order to achieve that. Arrays are the same way, in C/C++ they're stored in a contiguous block of memory, but in BMax, they're not, it's just a block of pointers. So you end up having to fake it with one of a few different measures ( eg: "unfolding" them into separate variables if they're small arrays or writing a wrapper if they're not. )<br><br>Now in terms specifically of the LUA modules, as I say, I haven't looked at them, so I don't know specifically why a module is required. It won't be the classes, I guess, because I think I'm correct in saying that LUA is written in pure ansi C, but I assume it will be something like that, perhaps in terms of letting LUA call BlitzMax functions and access BlitzMax arrays. I'm sure Noel, Tommy and others wouldn't have written the module(s) if it wasn't/they weren't required, and it does often seem to be the case that you need some BlitzMax "glue" ( forgive the LUA pun ) to get BlitzMax and C to bond. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
