Local obj:Object=new Object ' internal ref counter now at 1
Local objptr:Object Ptr

objptr=Varptr(obj)
RefInc(obj) ' manually increment ref counter so its 2

obj=Null ' ref counter back down to 1
FlushMem

objptr[0].ToString() ' its still there!!!

RefDec(objptr[0]) ' decrement the counter to 0
Flushmem ' bye bye

objptr[0].ToString() ' boom.  its now totally gone.
</pre><br><br>yes giving access to the ref counter opens the sytem up to leaks if the counter is not manipulated correctly, but i think taking that risk is worth it.  most of the time the garbage collection would be used anyway, but if need to do something special you could. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But ofcourse since .Net is heavilly tied into the underlying Win32 platform, it's hardly surprising it would inherit many of the same weaknesses as it's predecessor. Such a shame.

I disagree with your generalisation that the whole framework is tied to Win32, given the success of mono.<br>How has method overloading got anything to do with Win32?  This is a language function, not an OS or API function.  I don't recall any overloaded functions in Win32.  They use "Ex" style.  <br><br><br><div class="quote"> Yes. And the only reason for that is because the .Net framework is strongly typed - you'll notice that had it not been, they would have only needed one 2, and if they could have used the default option parameter workaround, as mentioned above they wouldn't have needed it at all. <br></div><br>...and stronly typed is bad because of?<br>Had it not been strongly typed, and I did <br><pre class=code>

Strong typing helps avoid silly issues like this.<br><br>Also, default parameters have nothing to do with the example I gave.  My example shows good use of overloading.  It is about passing a typed parameter in to a conversion function, and having the right method called.    <br><br>Dreamora:<br><div class="quote">  C++ and they way it works is about 20 years old.<br>The world has quite chanced since then ...<br><br>professionals might have missed that but all that are educated nowadays learn real OO system design and not C / C++ "hack your programm" style <br></div><br>Education and real world are two different things, mate.  I think your statement "the world has changed since then" should really be back by some real world experience.  I have a degree in CS and what works or is taught in an institution certainly does not always apply.  What is your argument that C++ is such a hacker style language?  C++ is currently going through another revision and standardisation, and is certainly not "old".<br>One thing you will learn in the real world, is there is no single languge that will solve every problem.  C++ has it's place.  As does Delphi, Python, Tcl, NT Batch Commands, C#, Lua, Assembler, VB.Net, etc.  Your attitude demonstrates your lack of experience.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Stu <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The GoF book descibes more than creational patterns. It describes all of the original design patterns in great detail, including, but not limited to creational ones.<br><br><div class="quote"> Moreover, the book you mentioned seems to be merely one approach to OO design (of which there are a great many), and nothing to do with C++ standards or guidelines. <br></div>Well since we're talking about a general feature of OO languages (function/method overloading) and not C++ guidelines, I would have thought that was preferable.

Your type implicitly extends object. Since there's an object overload to Convert.ToUI64 the problem is exactly the same. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
