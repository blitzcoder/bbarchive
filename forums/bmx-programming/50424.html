The editor would make use of a library<br>containing all the different media used in the game, and when you<br>drag it onto the 3d canvas, it creates another instance of that object.<br><br>What I propose is a very generic editor to use for games, with the option<br>that it can be customised to your likings (plugins).<br>Plugins could provide support for 3d sound entities, your own<br>physics library or a particle system that can be used fromout the Blitz<br>game editor. The editor being merged with the IDE, that would be perfect.<br><br>What I am saying is; the potentional of BlitzMax is great, the language<br>is what attracts me and distracts me from Unity and other "visual programming tools". But, I think it would be the right step if Blitz<br>Research developed tools for Blitzmax, not only Blitzmax.<br><br>Again; I am thinking long-term here. Perhaps Blitz Research could ask<br>Mr. Gile[s] to build it for them, make a nice deal or sumthing.<br>He has experience with these kind of tools. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Although I understand the whole "Dark Basic sucks VS Blitz Basic rules" debate, let's debate BRL.<br><br>What TGC understands is how to market a product, crappy or not. <br><br>A language is not going to attract a lot of people if you have to write your own tools. Its just the trend, and neccessary because games get more and more complex.<br><br>I'm not expecting UnrealEd here. But it would be nice if this tool framework was bundled with BlitzMax (for example in a more expensive package) so that every user can write their extension to handle their games.<br><br>This could be a list for the framework:<br><br>- object placement + library<br>- object handling (rotate,scale,resize)<br>- define your own object properties.<br>  E.g from XML you could define that objects like 'monsters'<br>  have the properties uglyness, energy, etc.<br>  And ofcourse there are the standard properties like<br>  alpha, shinyness, etc.<br>  You then could add your own script to that property<br>  so that you can preview it. E.g: alpha would run<br>  alpha.script and this simply sets the alpha.<br>  Or power ups would constantly rotate in the editor.<br>  This way the editor adjusts to your game.<br><br>  I saw a cloud generation tool for Blitz3D in the forums.<br>  Imagine this as a plugin for this entity placement tool.<br><br>- Saving file as text, XML or using your own loader/saver<br>- Grouping objects in portals (like in Quake)<br>- Maya / 3DSmax controls.<br>- Parenting, unparenting, showing you visually what the<br>  relationship is. This is shown as a tree in the list<br>  of objects.<br>- Sound entities (you can interactivly hear if the <br>doppler, distance, etc is set right)<br>- Lock/unlock, hide/unhide objects.<br><br>Thats it! No lightmapping nothin'! You can import lightmapped files fromout Gile[s]. Just a stable, decent, lightweight entity placement tool with the power to customise. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I can see why they are so good at marketing (because their products are junk).<br><br>Should BRL have a suite of tools or contracts with tool developers?<br><br>To answer a question with a question is WHY?<br><br>If others are creating tools you can use, why should BRL contract with them?  What is in it for BRL?  I mean they advertise for them freely in the tools section and randomly on the front page, why should they add more expensive suites of tools to THEIR product listing that BRL shouldn't have to support (but would be expected to support since they are selling it).<br><br>Why should BRL have to take the blame for companies like Aliencodec and such who don't respond to their customers for support?<br><br>So for BRL to offer tools for their language is upsurd in my eyes.  If you really want to create a game then your going to have to do the work, end of story.  If others have created tools you can use then good for you, but I don't think that it is BRL's responsiblity to give you a creategame() function!<br><br>You want AAA game, but you don't want to put AAA effort, perhaps you should rethink your ambitions.<br><br><div class="quote"> Since I improved my site, I have been getting some very interesting offers from very interesting people.

Now that it's codersworkshop its all geared twords sales and their site is impossible to go through to find usefull information.<br><br>BRL vs TGC just look at their userbase.  You have much more productive people at BRL than at TGC.  They may be making more money, but consider the complaint/satisfaction ratio of their products.<br><br>I may be bias to TGC, but that's because I know they will hype something up more than they can deliver for. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

C++ on the other hand is not! You're comparision is a load of bull!<br><br>And again...like mentioned IN THIS THREAD (See Dreamora's reply)....FORGET THG! "If you don't like this, go there" is just a stupid reply, no one can do something constructive with this lame sentence. <br><br>Dark Half, I am mainly active in the advertisement industry and I can say you: layout and appearance does matter. Halo said it right when he compared it to a business meeting. You are asking yourself "why market" - Halo already answered it in a post above yours already! <br><br>To be succesful you have to know that FORM is important, not the product itself. You can sell people sugar water with a flavour, or you can sell TROPICANA POWER DRINK. The latter sells, the former not. The same content. Different form. BRL should do the same. Especially when their latest product kicks ass.<br><br>And this doesn't mean you have to say "sell sell sell" like you stated (yes I also walk away when people do that). But do you see everything so black &amp; white DH? Is there only "no marketing" and "sell sell sell" to you? Both situations are bad. Why are you so negative when marketing can make a product and company healthy? It would also benefit you as a developer! Halo mentioned it.<br><br>Also, why do you think that if BRL does good marketing, advertisement and produces tools, the userbase will be less productive and be less satisfying? Because that is what you are saying in fact.<br><br>Why this lame comparision with THG and BRL? Why not compare Unity and Blitz, or UnrealED and Blitz? Unity and the Unreal users are VERY productive, both commercially and independent, the community is very active, and the products are marketed professionally. <br><br>Now THAT is a comparision I think. <br>Now THAT is something that's a goal BRL could try to reach.<br><br>You're being so negative man!<br><br>Dont forget: BRL already markets themselves or else they would not have developed this site. But they're doing it wrong, IMHO. So this discussion is not about wheter they should or shouldn't, its a discussion about HOW they should. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You think you're bringing anything new to the table? Ragging on BRL for their marketing efforts (as they are) is like everyones pet peeve around here.<br><br>Personally I find myself agreeing more or less with what Dark Half is saying. Why do you personally care how much effort BRL puts into advertising? Do you own stock? As long as they're making enough to stay in business, why should you care how they market themselves? It's not like Mark and Simon are new to this whole software thing. Heck, they've been making and publishing software since I was a kid!<br><br>So they aren't doing it the way you would do, or the way the guys over at TGC are doing or the guys at Idigicon, or the guys at Epic. Is that against the law or something?<br><br><div class="quote"> Also, why do you think that if BRL does good marketing, advertisement and produces tools, the userbase will be less productive and be less satisfying? Because that is what you are saying in fact. <br></div>I'll take a crack at that. Marketing, advertisments and tool production takes time away from BRLs primary business - the development of a high level games oriented programming language. Now less time spent on their primary business (what we're actually good at, if you consult your books) means that upgrades and patches will take longer to develop - when upgrades and patches take longer to develop the people who rely on these upgrades or patches in their current projects will naturally get less productive, as a particular show stopping bug grinds production to a halt (or worse, makes them switch to a different product), while they wait more or less patiently for BRL to release a long overdue patch or 3D module.<br><br>Sure marketing and advertising will help you ship products - no questions there - but long time commitment and focus on primary business areas, will keep existing customers happy in the long run, and generate a lot less animosity (like how everyone hates BarkBasic, for not being what it's cracked up to be and because DBS [now TGC] had a reputation for outright lying to their customers).<br><br>Dark Basic in it's current incarnation is still effectively broken software. At no point in it's 3+ year lifespan was there ever a version that could reasonably be considered "safe for production" - this despite the fact that DBS had more funds, arguably better marketing and more full-time employees than BRL. Personally, I prefer the better product to the better marketed one - but I realise that as a person who slings marketing BS for a living, that concept may seem alien to you.<br><br><div class="quote"> While it seems silly to be telling BRL to market themselves better, doing so would make the community more active, and draw in more people with good knowledge of stuff -- which would positively affect what I can do with Blitz products. <br></div>Be careful what you wish for, and all that. While I can see how what you're saying seems logical, the facts of the matter seems to indicate otherwise.<br><br>First of all, a more active community would seem to suggest a less productive one. Secondly, and more importantly, the larger the community, the larger the signal/noise ratio, thus making it much harder to actually find what you're looking for.<br><br>For instance I never visit the code archives anymore - there's just too much information there, and digesting it all to see if the code I need already exists, is often more time consuming than just writing it all from scratch. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
