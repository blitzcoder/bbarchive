However, it uses polymorphism to create a tree structure which is made up of nodes. Each node class extends a base node class, and has to implement begin, update and finish methods ( which are called when the node is executed, every frame while it's active and when it's done, respectively) and so each node inserts its own functionality while still adhering to the stucture of the base class. <br><br>Each node can have one or more children and these are returned by the Finish method. The Finish method is called when the Update method returns True.<br><br>Each node can implement its own system of storing children (in which case you have to cast the node to its actual type, of course) or it can simply use the standard one, which is a list of children, all of which are executed simultaneously after the current node is finished. Typically, each node only has one child.<br><br>If you want to add, for example, a dialogue menu, that would require its own children. So you'd have an array (or list) of options and when one is selected (either through Update or via callbacks setup in Begin) and Finish returns the option which corresponds to the user's choice.<br><br>You need to use function pointers or a good messaging system to make this work cleanly.<br><br>It's fairly simple, but fairly flexible, and it's easy to add new types of nodes when you decide you want your dialogue system to have features you didn't think of before.<br><br>How you actually store the data and/or design the dialogues is really independent of the code and design. I create mine in code, but you could read them from XML, or create a visual dialogue editor, but I'm using Unity, which already does 95% of the work for a visual editor so my code for that would be even more useless.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2010</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This scripting system should have the following features:<br>-&gt; Specify who is talking (so that you can show a name or a portrait).<br>-&gt; Allow you build options and branch your dialogue based on choices of phrases you give the player.<br>-&gt; Allow you to change game elements based on the choice of phrase, or store the player's choice so that later on you can read this value to do whatever you want.<br><br>PS: I seriously, seriously suggest you play around with the RPGMaker software so you know how it does it - it's not hard at all. It's got an amazing internal engine for RPG's and it's from where I get all reference regarding dialogue scripting. It has an interesting Switch system so that different events can relate to eachother (like you can easily make a dialogue choice have an impact on a door being open, some character doing something, etc.)<br>Here's a screen from a <a href="http://i56.tinypic.com/10wtjr9.jpg" target="_blank">dialogue script</a>. This is merely for viewing purposes; the process to build the script is much more intuitive, with GUI's and easy-to-read buttons. You should <a href="http://i54.tinypic.com/30j20yq.jpg" target="_blank">reproduce this functionality</a> in your game\engine\editor. <br>I suggest you go the visual editor way (building one in blitzMax, that is) because you work hard on it once, but then get to use it for all your dialogues - doing it all by code is going to be a major pain. Now that MaxGUI is free, you're halfway there.<br><br>By the way, <a href="http://i53.tinypic.com/vpcah5.jpg" target="_blank">here is the result of that script</a>.

If it's a person, the player will talk to that person (if that's what you put in that person's script of course).<br>Take a look again <a href="http://i56.tinypic.com/10wtjr9.jpg" target="_blank">at that event-script from RPGMaker</a>. This list will run through every time the player 'Acts' upon a special object with which this script has been associated, starting from the top, going down.<br><br>Therefore, in BlitzMax, you could store in your TScript (or whatever user-type you create for it) an array or TList containing such actions, in order. These actions could be in the form of functions or other objects (say, a TDialogue object with it's choices properly formatted, the portraits set up, and the script would call TDialogue.Run() for it to become active on screen, and when it ends, call the next action on the list). Not list, actually, but "Tree", because you need the capability of having a different set of actions be performed depending on a certain <b>condition</b> (say, a person say something else if the player is holding a certain item or has reached a certain level).<br>You need to have enough actions available for you to change anything in <b>the game's world</b> with your script. This way you can make levers that open doors, make treasure chests that give you a certain item, etc. All with a very modular, extensible and clean framework.<br><br>I'm sure someone with a better understanding of blitzMax's OOP capabilities can answer better in a more practical level.

If you want it more flexible, you could parse your own conversation files, and indeed XML would be a good way to store them. <br><br>There are various ways to structure them, perhaps something like this:<br><pre class=code>
&lt;conversation npc="guard"&gt;

The script would be processed sequentially every time you talked to them, but it would check a set of flags for a value.  And if something happened in the conversation, or elsewhere in the game that I wanted to impact the conversation, I'd set a flag.<br><br>So, for example, talking to the bartender might be flag #1.  When you start the game, that flag is set to 0.  When you talk to him for the first time, he introduces himself and then asks what you want.  The script sets the flag to 1.  If you talk to him again, the script engine sees that flag 1 is set, so he knows not to repeat his intro speech, and goes right to the "what can I get you" speech.<br><br>It worked well enough for the simple interactions in my game, but it got unwieldy if there was a lot of branching involved since I didn't have a good way to jump to another part of the conversation.

Say the player talks to the guard, the TConversation class will load the conversation with tag "guard".  It should then look for a &lt;message&gt; node inside. If it finds one, it should get the "required" property from the node (in this case "player.holds(MAP)").<br><br>This stage, parsing the required tag, is pretty game specific. Tbh, I haven't played with BMax for a while, but I don't believe there is a way to call a function from a string. (<i>func$ = "print('hello')"; call(func)</i> doesn't exist, right?)<br>Meaning, you'll have to slice the string and process it's syntax. An example with a more convenient syntax follows. Don't remember Max' functionality with Strings, but in psuedo:<br><pre class=code>
function requirementMet(required$ = "player.holds.map")

target$ = SplitStringAtDot(required, rest$) ' splits a string at dot like: (target).(rest)

I would make up my own format, instead of using XML.

It makes things much easier to deal with. <br>Doesn't matter which tags you use (just pick your favorite, like "&lt;&gt;" or "[]"). We won't be using XML but we can always base on it, somewhat. <br>I think the most important thing is to prioritize readibility, writeability and the easiness to parse the scripts later through code. <br>Because of this, we should keep the markup tags or characters down to a minimum, as well as very clear command names.<br>You should be able to write these game scripts out of NotePad, but I would highly recommend having GUI applications for this, just like RPGMaker has; it makes the process much more pleasant and intuitive.<br>You use a series of windows and buttons to place actions on the queue, and the application builds the script file in the end.<br><br>Example of possible constructs within script files (this is very crude and there is always some improvement to be made over the markups):<br><pre class=code>
[messageBox:7]
	[text:This is an example of a portrait-less Message Box. As you can see, there is no character-face markup telling which portrait to use when showing this text, so none will be used and the text will occupy the whole horizontal space available in the messagebox's frame. This is the kind of text you should use for signs, warnings and not-yet-revealed-character's dialogue. I was thinking the "7" in "messageBox:7" is the specification of the amount of lines the messagebox would hold - this influences the messagebox's vertical size.]

[comment]
Possible comment-like markup so you can write about the script. 
Works just like the Rem from BlitzMAX. A special tag could also be implemented to allow single-line remarks. Something like "#".
[/comment]

# Single line comment.
# End of Script.
</pre><br>The Horizontal Tab\indenting present in this script is just to make the reading more comfortable. You can have these characters (ASCII code 9) be ignored by your script-parsing-algorithm.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
