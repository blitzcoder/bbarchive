The guy then has a draw method that draws him and loops through anything he's carrying and draws that offset by his position. When he picks something up it should be removed from your list of stuff on the ground, or however else you're referencing that stuff to draw it when it's not being carried.<br><br>If you're not using OOP, you will want a list (or other grouping) of stuff being carried by your guy to serve a similar purpose.<br><br>Hope that helps get you started. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

</pre><br>You could do the same for the _y coordinate, rotation, etc. This way, you can handle complex chains of objects and they will be always related to their parents (wich will be related to the parents of the parents, etc.)<br><br>EDIT: The only problem of this design, is that you'll have to be careful to prevent cyclic parenting. If you do, you'll run out of stack, but it would be a bug in the code anyway.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Also it helps with off screen optimizations (if the MOB is not drawn you can skip looking at all the things it's holding too) but it's really down to what makes the most sense given the structure of your game... you can of course have both. An object can have a list of things it's holding, and something being held can have a reference to the thing it's holding...<br><br>Ziggy's example is easily applied as an extension of either method to further simplify drawing and your class structures. In practice I would use something along those lines, but if you're not into sub-classing, or your game is structurally simple enough that you don't want to go that extra step then you could skip it... again, whatever makes the most sense to you.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
