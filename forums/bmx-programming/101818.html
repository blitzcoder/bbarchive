As a reality check this is probably highly recommended.<br><br>If you want to sell non-games software then you may still be able to do that (well) for the desktop/laptop systems. If you, for example, want to develop a graphics utility you may want to check your competition first, though, as some programs are already that highly evolved that it is very difficult to enter the market. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
