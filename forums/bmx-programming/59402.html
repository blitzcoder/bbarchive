I can query OpenGL with glGetIntegerv() and it can say yes, but I also want to use a `graphics test` which proves whether separate backbuffer and frontbuffer are present. I am doing the test with an open display with words on it so I can SEE whether it is actually double buffered or not, but I am trying to get my test to comply with what is obvously true.<br><br>The test I am trying to do is as follows, but it doesn't seem to work right in all cases. It works in full-screen mode, with either single or double buffered displays. But in window mode it doesn't report correctly. I *should* be getting pixel values coming back from glReadPixels() but instead I get 0's. This appears to happen despite the fact that I can insert breaks which let me SEE that it actually does have a backbuffer, you can't see what's being drawn until it flips, etc.... and yet when I do the second set of DrawRect's to erase the backbuffer, it erases the front buffer, even though it is double-buffered! I have tried adding glDrawBuffer(GL_BACK) and all that, doesn't fix it.<br><br>Any ideas why this is not working in window mode, or how to test successfully in window mode?<br><br>(sorry about visual confusion from all the comments)<br><pre class=code>

...if this was true then we now know there is a doublebuffered display.
</pre><br>I thought maybe I need to put another glFinish() after Flip() to make sure it has finished copying the back to the front before I do the test?<br><br>Any other possibilities? Is there something I'm not seeing?<br><br>I know that you can never know whether your display will hardware-flip, copy, or whether the backbuffer will contain the previous frame, black, trash data, or a totally new backbuffer after the flip. Still doesn't seem to matter. Why does this code work fullscreen but not windowed?<br><br>It is mainly when I open a double-buffered window that it says there is no double buffering. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It worked fine in fullscreen and window mode with single or doublebuffering on my iMac.<br><br>However, my iBook certainly has some issues. I can't open fullscreen on the iBook so I can't test that, but in window mode the test fails when it should work. glReadBuffer() does seem to be being ignored and it almost seems as though when you do a Flip(), the backbuffer is now the visible buffer, and trying to read from the back actually reads from the front, and this changes back and forth every time you do a Flip().<br><br>What this basically means is that there are certain issues based on what computer you're on, which interfere with being able to graphically test for the presence of a backbuffer. So... since I obviously can't detect and adapt to the many many different configurations out there, with all their various specific bugs etc, I figure it is impossible to consistently get good test results for this.<br><br>So I'm going to just go with the error test - ie try to use glReadBuffer(GL_BACK) and OpenGL returns an error if there is no backbuffer. This, in addition to using glGetIntegerv() on the backbuffer flag which seems report correctly, is enough surety for me to prove whether or not the backbuffer is present. So I'm gunna dump the graphical test and just trust what OpenGL says.<br><br>Now I just need to test for the alpha buffer and the accumulation buffer.<br><br>I noticed that my desktop is 32-bit, according to OpenGL, and if I don't ask for an alpha buffer, I still get one. I find that interesting. You'd think it means that your window opens with the same format as the desktop. Not so. On my iBook the desktop is reported as 24-bit, no alpha, and it doesn't by default give you an alpha, but if you *ask* for one, you get one. So although it takes the desktop depth and setup as the default for what you'll get in your window, including any buffers that the desktop has (not sure if that applies to depth etc but the desktop typically only has alpha), you can *try* to override having only those buffers that the desktop has by asking for other ones.<br><br>I'll come up with a tidy function soon that I'll post, that requests a given screen mode/window with certain buffers and returns what buffers were actually given and whether the display opened properly.<br><br>I also had an idea for possible current issues or slowdown from using OpenGL in a MaxGUI window. .... Get the desktop width and height, open a MaxGUI window, find out what the client area size is, close the window, then open the old kind of desktop window using Graphics x,y,0, using the canvas size that was found.<br><br>That said, I have yet to experiment with what extra features I can add to the window with MaxGUI. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
