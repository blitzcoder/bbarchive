(Although Project Studio does highlight them.)<br><br>Am I missing something that allows this or do they simply not have this feature? <br><br>IDEal uses this really well I just wish that these two IDEs would do the same as otherwise they are both outstanding products.<br><br>I would also like to say a really big well done to the author of BLIde. I recently tried it again and have to say that despite not being too keen on it the first time it now really has improved tenfold. You and the author of Project Studio (also really great!) are doing great things for us BMax users so a big thankyou for that.<br><br>These are only minor niggles but maybe you would both consider adding these features as I`m sure that other people would appreciate them too.<br><br>Jason.  <br><br>(BTW, is there a way to automatically close the output window in BLIde after running your code as it is the first window that has focus after running my program and I have to manually click on my code window again to select it, again nothing major just a little annoying.) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Quite sure they don't in Visual Studio either, which is what PS is 'inspired' by.  Personally I wouldn't want it any other way (except maybe optional).<br><br>In your example, Move() and Create() would appear in intellisense.  (If you don't like intellisense, switch it on and get used to it.  It can save you loads of typing).<br><br>Can't really offer an opinion of any worth on BLIde as I haven't used it for about 18 months now.<br><br>[edit] I tell a lie.  I looked at BLIde again maybe six months ago and couldn't make head nor tail of how it handles projects - something which is very straightforward in PS. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You can imagine wich performance hit this can introduce if you change a single line of code in, as instance, the wx module. So This won't be added to BLIde unless the whole core engine of BLIde changes drastically, and this is something I don't expect to happen in months or even years... (I'm doing some small tests on the WPF framework, but I don't even know if them will see the light of day anytime.) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Please tell me it`s not far off now :)<br><br>Jason.<br><br>(Also is there a way to move the folder that is saved to My Documents to another location as I would rather place it somewhere else.

I find this very strange to look at personally and would prefer either all to be highlighted or all to be un-highlighted.<br><br>Am I alone in this? Maybe it`s just me but I would rather have a consistent look if it were my choice.
