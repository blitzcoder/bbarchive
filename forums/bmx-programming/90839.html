Made an account &amp; group management web application (for Active Directory through LDAP calls) that implemented a standards book about an inch thick.  Its up for National use so thats cool, but when I was doing that I didn't want to program again later in the evening, so making games just dropped off the map.  I MUCH prefer having my programming time for games but thats just a personal thing.  I moved into Management so I have programming energy now. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Up to 2006 I made enough to pay for, say, a couple of cars.  But as it was my main income for a couple of years, it mostly went on bills and boring stuff.<br><br>Writing games for yourself is one thing as you can do what you want.  I don't think I could take a job where someone tells me to write a game, and I write it.  It might be a game I completely despise and I know that'd show through.<br><br>If you're planning to do it freelance I'd strongly recommend a business/accounting course of some kind.  I'm considering that myself at the moment, just to brush up on things.<br><br>If you plan on working for a AAA games company then you will need to learn C++ inside out.  A lot of companies accept graduates but they do expect high-level qualifications and/or a proven track record in writing released games. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In the latter I've no advice, for the former - go to college and get a computer programming degree.  After that take whatever job you can get as a start (I would avoid operations type work though - that usually gets you nowhere.)  After you get some experience switch jobs and work your way up - some companies promote from within but not many.  If you are a top performer you will work your way steadily up the ladder.  A LOT of people got into programming simply for the money a few years ago, and they are easy to get past...<br><br>As for liking the work, I love it - part of that is luck on the jobs that I got, another part is that I am good at it, and the final part is that I like the entire software development process from gathering specifications all the way through to ongoing support (well, support of a program that stinks is no picnic - but I've written most of the programs I supported) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I have about 80% of a computer science degree, and I do recommend finishing one simply because it will expose you to some basic stuff that a lot of people will miss if they are self taught.<br><br>I have pretty much always worked for an employeer in an office. At my current job, they have a great environment and usually very interesting work. I was hired as a PHP programmer but on my first day given a Django book and was told I'd be doing Python/Django programming. It's been pretty much awesome to work at a place that recognizes individual's abilities apart from a piece of paper - they care about what you get done and what your skills are.<br><br>The problem is that I don't think there are very many places like this. My previous job had a very different culture that I fond sort of depressing. I did learn "new" technologies there - but they were only "new" to me. Had to do a lot of Classic ASP and T-SQL programming. If you don't know what it's like to debug a 500 line T-SQL stored procedure written by a guy who still works at the company but refuses to maintain his own shitty code, then you are a luckier person than I.<br><br>I guess what I'm saying is that it's a mixed bag. The money is good - I'm not aware of any other field where someone without a college degree can make a significant amount of money in such a relatively short period of time. I do well for myself, I'm comfortable and I have almost always liked what I do - even at the previous place I complain about.<br><br>The bottom line for me was this: I'd been programing since I was 9. I simply couldn't imagine doing anything else. If someone doesn't feel that they have no choice *but* to go into programming, I can't recommend it. You'll hate it if you don't love it already. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
