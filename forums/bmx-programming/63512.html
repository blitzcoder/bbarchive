Never makes any difference though. As you might imagine there is nothing installed on my current PC ( hardware, software or firmware ) which is the same as a machine from six or seven years ago.<br><br>I think more likely is that the thing in common is coding style. Perhaps it's related to whitespace, any of a hundred little habits one might develop over the years and not even notice which - if not a trigger - make it more likely to happen. Lots of copying and pasting, or none. Could be almost anything, but I'm pretty sure it's this rich edit control, because it never happens in Apps which don't have it.
