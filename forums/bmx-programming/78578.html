Although unlikely, it's entirely possible that in any future update of Blitz the order will change, which might break your program if it depends upon the order.<br><br>So it depends if you want to program 'pratically' or 'theoretically' :)<br><br>For example say you have an And in an If. The computer runs the first function and it returns false. Now whatever the second function is, it doesn't matter the If will still be false (because And needs both to be true) so a smart thing to do would be to simply ignore the second condition - there is no need to waste time checking it. The only problem is, if the act of checking alters the results (quantum mechanics here we go!) and so the program logic might break because a vital function has not been ran. I hope I'm explaining this in a good way.<br><br>C++ has lots of little optimizations like this, one reason why it's so fast, and that's why C++ programmers are extra careful about making sure things are done 'properly'. I don't know if Blitz uses this optimization or not, but if it doesn't, and Mark decides to add it later, you'll be in trouble if you previously relied upon it not being there! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
