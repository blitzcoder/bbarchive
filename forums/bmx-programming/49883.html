</pre><br>it doesnt seem to have any affect when i Import the file though.  i can still call mytest() from an instance of privtest and if i extend privtest, i can call the method there as well.  does anyone know if this is supposed to work or has anyone accomplished type method/function hiding?  hiding works fine with stand alone functions and hiding entire types. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you try to use the scope modifiers within a type decleration C++ style it won't compile. Perhaps it's only half implemented?<br><br>I've only seen them used in a 'global' manner to set the scope of the entire Type.  I also think they can be applied to variables and free functions.<br><br>I will agree with you RktMan that the OO implementation is a bit funky.  I think it's because BRL was trying to make everyone happy.  Keep all procedural support, but introduce OO features that will encourage people to move to them instead of scaring them away.  Also if this is to be fixed it's probably been left because it can be worked around without too much hassle. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

</pre><br>It's worth bearing in mind that BlitzMax was never meant to be a full OO language -- it's only meant to bring in [what Mark considers to be] the most useful OO features. (I'd still like to see hidden methods and fields myself though!) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
