Also sensible.<br><br>However, the wrinkle is that an object's type is dynamically changed while the objects is being created/destroyed. <br><br>So when the base class New() is called, the object truly *is* of type Base. If New() calls any methods, then only the Base type version of that method is called - not any derived type version.<br><br>Ditto Delete() - by the time base type Delete() is called, the object is again of type Base and any calls to methods will only call the base type method. So TIO is indeed bugged.<br><br>This is logical, as once the derived type has finished Delete(), it is no longer of type 'Derived' - theoretically, it doesn't exist and it's fields have no meaning. Ditto before it's New() is reached.<br><br>C++ does this and I'm 99% sure Java does also, but I do agree it is confusing and wonder if it should be changed. On the other hand, the current system does mean that you can guarantee New() is exactly the first method ever called on your object, which is nice to know...<br><br>As for the field instances issue, this is the case with all OO languages I know of - Java/C++/ObjectiveC. Fields with the same name as a superclass field always have their own 'version' in memory which hides the superclass version - unless you use 'Super.' to access the superclass version. This too I find logical - you should not even being using superclass fields, and it could be argued that not even subclasses should see your fields! Fields are really just an implementation detail of your 'level' in the class hierarchy. Methods are what provide the abstraction.<br><br>Hope that clears things up a bit, but please note that Max is not particularly unusual in it's behaviour. Object creation/destruction is a subtly complex issue, as you're dealing with 'half created' objects during the process. With parameters and overloading, it's even more complex! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
