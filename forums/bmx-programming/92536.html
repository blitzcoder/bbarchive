    mov ebx,myvar ' theis gets the value stored in myvar which will be the address of myvar.
    add [ebx],eax 'this adds the value stored in register eax to the value store in myvar address
</pre><br>the address of myvar is not a fixed number and must be calculated at runtime sense the program can be loaded at different locations in ram depending on available memory. <br><br>for local:<br><pre class=code>
    add ebx,eax  'in this case ebx is used as the variable and eax is added to ebx
</pre><br>moving data from one register to another is alot faster than moving data from a register to an address.<br><br>of course nothing is that simple. the main problem is that there are only a limited number of registers and if you are using more local variables than there are registers "available/free" than the variables are going to start to be pushed and popped from a stack and most of the advantage of using locals goes down the drain. In any case locals will be faster than globals for processing.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2010</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

</pre><br><br>There's only 1 allocation, and no collection, however it's still global (this also assumes that Atype can be re-used and doesn't need to be re-initialized... maybe it's just a function holder or some other utility etc.). I would assume this would largely have to do with how complex Atype is, in that it's complexity (number of fields, etc.) will determine how much work it takes to allocate, and also collect. Where as the global vs. local question is just a matter of how long it takes to address... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Variables are just references to an object, they are not collected. Each time you come across New, there is a new object. You can jiggle up the variables, but if you need 5 objects you need 5 objects.<br><br>As Jesse points out, local variables can be placed onto registers which are much faster. Especially a creation function that will only have one local variable and a few parameters, a local variable is very efficient. Plus having globals scattered around the place is very confusing and even if they were faster I would avoid them for that reason alone. "Finished is better than optimised" I agree (although according to some people I am a micro-optimization freak??) but in this case, not only are locals optimized, they will get your game finished faster, so to speak!<br><br>ima, I don't understand what you are suggesting. I'm not a garbage collector expert, but I think the hardest work is finding and keeping track of the dead objects. Once you've found an object, actually deleting it is easy, so I don't think the complexity of the object is signifiant in how long it takes to collect.<br><br>Edit: That said, an object which contains other objects that depend upon it for their existence (single reference to them) would cause more work for the garbage collector as there'd be more things for it to manage. One thing I miss from C++ is you can choose whether contained objects use dynamic or regular memory. The latter is faster but the object is destroyed when its parent object dies no matter what. But sometimes that's exactly what you want.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2010</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
