If not, create it in the same way the original was created, and if it needs to import the original file, THE HEADER IS ALREADY THERE. And viola!

The language should just be what it is ( preferably with a strict syntax where there is no ambiguity ), but having different levels of syntax strictness is crazy.<br><br>On the topic of imports, I have actually rethought what I wanted. I would actually prefer a grouping concept such as a module that acts like a package in Java. So you have something like this:<br><br><pre class=code>
Package rds.util.Hashtable

Import brl.blitz
...

Type Hashtable
    ...
EndType
</pre><br><br>Because what you want is everything available in your project to be available to the rest of a project because it WOULD be stupid to have a TShip in one project reference and TMissile in another project. But in my game, these classes need to reference eachother. So they would be put in the same package and any file would automaticaly know about anything else in the package. So that eliminates the need for cyclic Imports and I think then everyone is happy. Because in the real world, classes aren't always going to be standalone. They need to work together. So it would seem counter-intuitive to only be able to have classes work together if they are all in the same long file or included messily together. Ya see what I mean I hope? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Thats why I am actually doing throug the bmx file I import which itself only includes other files. This file is then used by my project as a single package (which then only needs to be rebuilt if any of the included files changed) with its local knowledge of the others, but without giving out such knowledge to the outer world. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In actuallity you should combine the Package idea with the Module idea so that there is a uniform way of organizing code. So basically you have the languages modules (brl.blitz, brl.max2d...), your own modules (rds.tools, rds.coolstuff...) and your project modules (rds.CoolGame, rds.MapEditor...). So my game would be in rds.Spacewar module, and would have access to all files in the Packages (Spacewar.bmx, Ship.bmx, Missile.bmx...) and THEN all the classes in a module will be able to successfully (and without cyclic imports or messy includes) access eachother and create a more powerful and more organized program. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
