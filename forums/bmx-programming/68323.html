I did try installing Blitzmax on the Vista PC to fix it there and then, which is an issue in itself.<br><br>I read about the OpenAL driver but I don't know where to start in getting this to work.  I guess I need to install third party stuff since <b>Import brl.openalaudio</b> and <b>EnableOpenALAudio</b> seems to do absolutely nothing.  I don't think I can expect my customers to go installing other bits and pieces to get my game to work.<br><br>Anybody got any solutions to this problem?<br><br>Note to the Anti-Microsoft brigade - not supporting Vista isn't an option.<br><br>By the way - what problems did I encounter with Blitzmax and vista?<br><br>Well, first of all, I tried to install Firefox.  IE7 point blank refused to go to www.getfirefox.com, while every other site worked fine.<br><br>I stepped around the issue by getting it from download.com.<br><br>I then tried to get BLIde.  Firefox needed a plugin.  Yep, you guessed it, it wouldn't download any plugins!<br><br>So I went with MaxIDE.  Tried to syncmods - It downloaded a few modules, up to dxMax2D, at which point a message appeared in the output window "Unhandled memory exception".<br><br>It now does this every time I try to sync mods.<br><br>So I think I'll be passing on Vista until it actually works, but for now, I need to get my game sorted so it works properly on Vista. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I now use Vista as my main OS for everything except play games.  Firefox is my browser of choice, I use BLIde as my IDE for BlitzMax, and have had little or no problems that weren't quickly resolved.<br><br>I do run from an admin account with UAC disabled, which probably goes a long way to having BlitzMax syncmods and generally work well.  MinGW also installed and worked with a little extra effort (detailed in the module tweaks forum I believe).<br><br>The DirectSound problem is more than likely down to a driver issue for the reasons mentioned above.  I already had OpenAL installed, although I'm not sure where it came from - maybe as part of my sound drivers, or possibly a game that needed them!  Of course, if a user doesn't have OpenAL installed already, it will mean another download, which as you say, is not really an option, as everything should work "out of the box", so to speak.<br><br>Hopefully it won't take too long for the drivers to become Vista compatible, so the problem shouldn't be around for too long.  Just need to make sure that the end user is aware that it is more important now than ever to ensure that their drivers are up to date. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
