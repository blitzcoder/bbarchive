It's very unlikely I know, but if it would happen I don't wanna sit on a heap of nice code, in my own project, that is not usable on the latest version of the compiler because the lib is no longer functional in this compiler version.<br><br>Take my iGlass experience this evening as an example: There is some built in "ResolutionRequester" dialog in a function. This function failed for me because on my laptop there is no graphic mode for 640x480 available when using the built in screen(!). This situation was probably completely unthinkable when the original author wrote the code, but now apparently there is modern hardware+drivers that does not accept a 640x480 full screen window. Since i got the code i simply went into the function and added the logic to have it check for valid graphicmodes in this order: 640x480, 800x600, 1024x768 ... voila! the lib is working nice again! And if I feel good that particular day I can mail this update to the author of iGlass (I haven't done it yet though :-)<br><br>Well sorry for long rant, my main point (with last post) was that the lib is very nice and will do good for anyone less paranoid than I am, but I just wanted people to know that they don't get the source, so that was clear when comparing Game GUIs. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

One of the graphics-based GUIs becomes perfect for that, even if it's only used to provide Start Game and Exit buttons. The more complex a game gets, the more it may well require an interface. A bog-standard match three game can be almost entirely GUI driven, saving an awful lot of work. A football management title is 99% user interface.<br><br>I imagine the more complex gadgets like spinners, multi-line text boxes and so forth get implemented in the release in part because they're expected gui elements, but also because it lets the developer expand what his GUI is capable of under the hood. A spinner, for example, may consist of two buttons and a text field that effectively "talk" with one another, the buttons automatically altering the value in the field. A game may never require a spinner, but a GUI that can handle internal events such as that is more expandable. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
