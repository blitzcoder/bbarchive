I am at an early stage but figuring that there might be a lot of objects on screen by the time it is finished - i have decided to split the screen into collision-zones.<br><br>Each of these zones  is 128 x 128 pixels, and the idea is that everytime i move an alien or bullet, i work out which zone(or zones) it is in and then I add it to a list which is attached to each zone. (one list for player bullets, one list for aliens)<br><br>I then go through each zone and do collision checks on just the objects in each zone. This saves a lot of collision checks.<br><br>For example if i have 10 player bullets on screen and 50 aliens. thats 10*50=500 collision checks. but using the zones this would hopefully be cut to maybe 50 collision checks.<br><br>My question is - is this a good idea? and am i doing it the fastest way? <br><br>At the moment i automatically remove all instances of an object (using RemoveLink) from the collision-zones and then i calculate which zones it is in its new position.<br><br>I included a screen shot to show how the screen is split up into zones.<br><br><img src="http://i468.photobucket.com/albums/rr45/RimShot69/GameZonesb.jpg"><br><br>the white bullets are player bullets.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The biggest FPU consumption is going to be in displaying the sprites(animations,explosion particles and tiles). I don't do pixel perfect collision because "THAT" is really slow instead I do bounding box collision.  <br><br>the way you are handling sound like a good idea. Are you using an array for the list zones? it sounds like you are and it seems like the best way to do it.

I only updated the linked lists IF an object changes from one cell to another.<br><br>You should put objects in the cells based on the coordinate of their TOP LEFT corner, which ensures that you then only need to check the cell to the right, the cell below, and the cell below to the right instead of checking all surrounding cells.<br><br>Also ideally you want the cell sizes to be as close to (but no smaller than) the size of the largest object you're planning to store in it. If you have a lot of objects of a small size and only a few larger ones it's worth putting all the small ones on a smaller grid by themselves and use a larger grid for the big ones. The `tigher` the cell box can fit around an object the less often you have to waste time testing a collision.<br><br>I also recommend that if possible, instead of using a linked list in each cell use an associative array, ie one array storing the index/handle of an object and one array implementing a linked list structure of pointers.<br><br>Another option is to forceably update the whole grid every frame, which would be quick to do using a single array in each grid cell, but wastes time as well due to updating objects which aren't changing cells in this frame, but if you have a lot of movement going on it may help.<br><br>With a grid you should easily be able to handle 10,000 objects where every object can potentially collide with every other object.<br><br>However, my question to you is, do your enemy sprites collide with EACH OTHER? If not then the grid is a big waste of time. If the player ship sprite collides with the grid but elements in the grid don't collide with other elements in the grid, then you may as well just check for collision between the player and all enemies (although I suppose a grid would speed that up too).<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Depending on the nature of your object distribution this can be even more effective, but anything that reduces the search helps, of course.<br><br>Oh, and yes, it only really makes sense if there's a problem with the amount of search necessary to begin with. In my case I've done swarming, where every element had to check with every element. This kinda stuff creates some very exciting motion patterns for enemies, too, by the way. But ordinarily those shooters don't go that far, I think.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Its possible it would make it a lot more complicated to write - using zones - because i want some really big beam weapons (like the one in Fast Striker <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_tnqgKFnto)" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_tnqgKFnto)</a> which would be lot bigger than the zones. So that would mean extra complication<br><br>I do pixel perfect collision at the moment, because i heard the ImagesCollide command does a rectangle test before it does a pixel perfect one so i figured it would be fast enough?. Also some of the aliens rotate which makes it hard just checking rectangles.  (I use ImagesCollide2 at the moment)<br><br>I tried your game, its very good! I like the gfx effects in the background too. It didnt drop below 230 fps for me the whole time i was playing , so your method does seem fast enough :)<br><br>I am using an array like this for the zones <br><br><textarea class=codebox name="code" wrap=OFF readonly="true" rows="15" cols="80">

I know Imaginary Human said earlier about only removing items from zone lists if they move to a new zone. I was wondering is it faster to just remove all links (like i am doing now) or doing checks to see if they have changed zones.
