</textarea><br>the rotation of the enemy entity is set to e.angle.<br><br>this works to rotate the enemy left, until he is facing you. When difference = 0 the enemy stops rotating.<br><br>I need to turn the enemy based on the smallest angle regards his forward facing direction and the angle of the player. So that he doesn't rotate 330 degrees left, when he could simply have rotated 30 degrees right, so to be facing the enemy.<br><br>I had it to the point where the enemy would rotate to face you as i moved to the left and right of his facing vector (crossed his face), he would start to turn to face either way in stead of going all around. Which is good. But somehow when I got around the back end, it would mess up when I got very nearly 180 degrees behind him, he would start rotating from the far side.<br><br>I've tried so many different combinations and I know I am over looking something simple, but I couldn't get it fully right.<br><br>I've checked if the difference was 180 or -180 or if it was between 180 and 360 and between 0 and 180.  <br><br>I thought that made sense, since I am checking each half, and whichever half is closer, I either + or - the rotation of the enemy facing angle.<br><br>Any advice on what I have overlooked is appreciated thanks!<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2013</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If i could get the difference to read full 360, then check between 0-180 and 180-360, it would actually rotate till the front faced, and it would still have the working intelligence of which way is the shortest to go in terms of degrees. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
