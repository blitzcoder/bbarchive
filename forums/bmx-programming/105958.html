In fact it probably has a name, so any pointers to a name for Google searching would be appreciated too. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If they divide the rectangle into two "islands" then there can be no solution. So let's take what seems the most favorable case, together in a corner. If they fit in a single row or column that's even better.<br><br>Next, how snaky does the path have to be? There would be an obvious solution "by rows" or columns. But that's not snaky at all. What about the other extreme, a turn at every step? What I mean is never two consecutive steps in the same direction.<br><br>In that case there will not always be solution. Consider an extremely simple case, a 3x3 grid with one corner grayed out. A little scribbling will soon demonstrate that an always turning path is impossible. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I have spent some time working on very small grids working up in size, the number of valid routes increases exponentially with grid size.<br><br>I did consider using known valid 4x4 routes and breaking down larger grids fractal style - so a 16x16 would become a 4x4 of 4x4's. The down side to this method is it makes the maze puzzle a bit easier once you know the fractal method is in use.<br><br>Your example of a 3x3 with one square greyed out - the one doesn't have to be on a corner, any one greyed out causes a real problem for a snaky route.<br><br>I'm sure I read something on this many years ago, wish I could remember who wrote it... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

A notable example is the Hilbert curve which operates in your "breaking down larger grids" style. It starts with a 2x2 grid, trivially filled with a U shape. A 4x4 grid is considered to be a 2x2 grid with each cell being a 2x2 square. These are filled in Hilbert style and the appropriately oriented U's are connected to make a path.<br><br>But I've never seen these applied to situations where not all cells in the rectangular grid are available. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
