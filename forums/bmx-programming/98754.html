I currently have a nice musichandler class which can cross-fade tracks - obviously that wouldn't be a great idea if I was loading a massive audio file into memory at once, as I'd effectively have to have two files (one fading out, one in) and that would be costly in terms of resources.  Plus the loading/decompression time would be horrid.<br><br>Any usable MaxMod alternatives?

I've had a look at irrKlang and that's only €290 for an Indie licence (€348 with VAT added on), which isn't too bad if it does the job well on all platforms.  Though there is a dubious requirement for me to show the irrKlang logo on website and documentation, which is slightly off-putting. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
