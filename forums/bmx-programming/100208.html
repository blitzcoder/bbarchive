You can also implement the concept of `immediate data` (similar to assembly language here) by storing integer data in the same array as the function pointers. Then each function `eats` a known hardcoded amount of data and increments the program counter before returning. You can store most data types by converting them to integers. I had this up and running very nicely with quite an extensive library of functions and also then began to implement a custom scheduler which could interleave/prioritize calls to the functions from multiple `programs` at once, so that there could be some simple multitasking - of course at a fairly coarse grained level but useful nonetheless.<br><br>This was of course before BlitzMax got proper threads ;-) But using threads with `function call programs` is also quite useful as a way to batch jobs that need performing ie each thread runs through an array of function pointers to do work. The function pointers can even manage the state of the scheduling system, implement loops/branches, make a program end or suspend or loop around, or put the thread to sleep, etc.<br><br>Another good use of threading is the thread pool - create lots of threads up-front and then re-use them and put them to sleep as needed. I recommend allocating 2x as many threads as there are cpu cores because often a given thread doesn't get to use 100% of a core. I also found it very useful, if this applies to you, to interleave the memory accesses performed by concurrent threads as they pass over a set of data, because this seemed to do well with the shared cache instead of accessing entirely separate chunks of data. I'm pretty sure I saw a 50% speedup on a dual-core machine this way. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Theres still plenty of work to do but the foundation of calling bmax objects directly from c++ is stable and it also relies on its own reference counting.<br><br>It works by knowing the BMax object layout in memory and the c++ object layout in memory and injecting a pointer to the BMax object method table into where the c++ object is expecting its one. You can then call those methods directly from c++ as you would normally do with a c++ object method ( pObject-&gt;CallMe[ ... ] ), also with passing variables into and out of the methods reliably. It uses the Win32 calling convention to keep the stack in check. Using the C calling convention misaligns the variables of the stack for my purposes, and as COM is *mostly* used on Windows ( even though it could be used with other systems) , I didn't bother looking into why that is or fixing it.<br><br>Its unlikely the BMax object layout will change nowadays and although there is no standard defined for the layout of c++ objects in memory, it seems most c++ compilers lay out their objects in the same pattern. So by abusing that fact I can reliably call different instances of types and its methods directly from c++ without any of that extra C glue code.<br><br>So now, I've started fleshing it out into a usable system to see how it scales rather than just leaving it as a proof of concept demo.<br><br>The whole idea came from allowing c++ code written from outside the BMax environment to access BMax objects by utilizing the COM paradigm. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

By this definition JavaScript is most definitely portable. C sure ain't if you're using it within its domain, since the point of using it is usually to play with nonstandard details. Similarly I am lost as to how you could consider Java non-portable since that is its entire hat; and given that half of those languages potentially offer backends that run through a C compiler as a final step, they are <i>by definition</i> at least as portable as C anyway.<br><br>As for usefulness: again, define. You can generate code, the code will be efficient, the library access is as good as C++, and the build process is easy (to generalise across all those suggestions). Most of those languages can do absolutely anything C++ can do - certainly within the user-level application development arena. And since what they can do, they do more safely and with shorter development (objectively measurable by time/LOC), that equates to "better" by what I consider a perfectly reasonable definition.<br><br>Meanwhile, the suggestion that C++ is safer than C when used like C is baffling. C++ has pitifully few safety features and almost all of them require you to write code in completely different ways. You can't implicitly cast from void*. Woohoo. Other than that...? shared_ptr and unique_ptr hardly count as C-like, while blind reliance on e.g. RAII for everything is likely to trash your memory performance <i>which is the reason</i> you would have been using C. etc. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
