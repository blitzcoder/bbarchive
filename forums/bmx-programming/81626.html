I wrote up a quickie (although a bit lengthy) example of how it could work in blitzmax.<br><br>Let's start with the syntax of how it'd be used since ultimately that's what we're trying to go for once all the nitty-gritty is implemented:<br><br>so let's say your game requires physics for multiple objects. But you have one particular type of 'object' that needs physics AND be controlled by the player BUT you don't want collision detection for the player as they can walk through walls for instance:<br><br><pre class=code>
' lets make an object that has physics, AND can be controlled by our player.
Local myPlayer:TBaseObject = TBaseObject.Create("Robot", 40, 40)

'...now to give our new empty object physics and controls we simply add the functionality to them
myPlayer.AddComponent(New TPhysicsComponent)
myPlayer.AddComponent(New TControllerComponent)
myPlayer.Init()

' lets run it!
myPlayer.Update()
</pre><br>Following that logic, say your player can shoot different types of bullets. Bullets collide with objects but don't obey your normal physics. Let's say one of these types of bullets is a laser. So the setup code could look something like this, note that I don't add a physics component because my bullets don't need them:<br><br><pre class=code>
' now lets make a bullet with laser flight
Local myBullet:TBaseObject = TBaseObject.Create("Laser", 30, 30)
myBullet.AddComponent(New TLaserComponent)
myBullet.AddComponent(New TCollisionComponent)
myBullet.Init()

myBullet.Update()
' and so on...
</pre><br>By now hopefully things make a little more sense as to how different object 'types' can be composed, and potentially how much flexibility you now have when designing your in-game objects. Now when I want to tweak how my laser logic works I just edit the laser component, with very little worry about affecting other portions of the 'whole'.<br><br>Ok, an example implementation follows. I apologize for the length, but it's a complete working example so for those that wish to know the basics of how it works hopefully can benefit from this.<br><br>Let's start with our base object that will be housing these components:<br><br><pre class=code>
rem
this is our 'container' class.
it provides very basic functionality that we 
determine every 'object' should have.
in this example I've only determined
that each 'object type' should have a name and position
end rem
Type TBaseObject
	Field _name:String
	Field _components:TMap = CreateMap()
	Field _x:Float
	Field _y:Float
	
	' factory method to help create a base object.
	Function Create:TBaseObject(name:String, x:Float, y:Float)
		Local obj:TBaseObject = New TBaseObject
		obj._name = name
		obj._x = x
		obj._y = y
		Return obj
	End Function
	
	' some basic setters/getters
	Method SetPosition(x:Float, y:Float)
		_x = x
		_y = y
	End Method
	
	Method GetX:Float()
		Return _x
	End Method
	
	Method GetY:Float()
		Return _y
	End Method
	
	Method GetName:String()
		Return _name
	End Method
	
	' to provide some coherency
	' we'll add an init() function
	' that we call once all the components
	' for an object have been added
	' and wish to initialize themselves
	Method Init()
		For Local comp:TComponent = EachIn _components.Values()
			comp._OnAdd(Self)
		Next
	End Method
	
	' our update function becomes
	' simplified for this object
	' since all the functionality
	' is tucked away in it's components.
	Method Update()
		For Local comp:TComponent = EachIn _components.Values()
			comp.Update()
		Next
	End Method
	
	' this allows use to search for a particular component
	' and functionality based on name. Since it is 
	' using a tmap, retrevial is fast compared to a linked list.
	' the only downside is 'update' order is not easily determined. a trade-off
	' but could be solved with a more complex solution.
	Method GetComponent:TComponent(componentName:String)
		If _components.Contains(componentName) Then
			Return TComponent(_components.ValueForKey(componentName))
		End If
		Return Null
	End Method
	
	' this adds a new type of component
	' to this object. In this implementation
	'you cannot add, for instance, 2 physics components, as it doesn't make much sense
	Method AddComponent(component:TComponent)
		If Not _components.Contains(component.GetType()) Then
			_components.Insert(component.GetType(), component)
		End If
	End Method
End Type
</pre><br>Nothing too mind-blowing out of the above. I chose to use a TMap as my collection class for components for faster 'look ups'. Others may choose to stick with lists, but that detail is irrelevant for this example. One constraint about the above system: you cannot add the same type of component more than once to a single base object.<br><br>Now for our component class:<br><br><pre class=code>
rem
our base component class.
each component class _must_ have a way of identifying what type 
of component it is. For this example we will just use a 'type' string. 
This isn't the most 'strongly' typed way to do it, but for simplicity
it will do.
end rem
Type TComponent Abstract
	Field _owner:TBaseObject
	Field _type:String
	
	Method New ()
		_type = "TComponent"
	End Method
	
	Method GetOwner:TBaseObject()
		Return _owner
	End Method
	
	Method GetType:String()
		Return _type
	End Method
	
	Method SetType(typeName:String)
		_type = typeName
	End Method
	
	
	Method OnAdd(owner:TBaseObject) Abstract
	Method OnRemove() Abstract
	Method Update() Abstract
	
	rem
	this is consider an 'internal' method
	used only by our base component class to help facilitate the aggregation
	end rem
	Method _OnAdd(owner:TBaseObject)
		_owner = owner
		OnAdd(owner)
	End Method
	
	rem
	another internal method to help facilitate the component structure
	end rem
	Method _OnRemove()
		_owner = Null
		OnRemove()
	End Method
End Type
</pre><br>A rather small class. It only requires children to implement an 'Update','OnAdd', and 'OnRemove'. So it is pretty open to do essentially whatever you want. You could even require components to have a Draw() method, making components a viable way of implementing different rendering styles.<br><br>Now how is a component class implemented from the above code?<br><pre class=code>

' a basic physics component could encapsulate the physics calculations
' and formulas needed to do simulations.
Type TPhysicsComponent Extends TComponent
	Field _velx:Float
	Field _vely:Float
	
	Method New ()
		SetType("TPhysicsComponent")
	End Method
	
	Method OnAdd(owner:TBaseObject)
		' sometimes a component may want to query for other components
		' in the owner to gain access to other data if there are dependencies.
	End Method
	
	Method OnRemove()
		
	End Method
	
	' a trivial example for 'physics' functionality.
	Method Update()
		Local owner:TBaseObject = Self.GetOwner()
		Local x:Float = _velx + 3
		Local y:Float = _vely + 3
		owner.SetPosition(x, y)
		Print "physics update!"
	End Method
End Type
</pre><br>A very rudimentary (ie non-functioning) physics component. You could imagine a physics component that did actual physics calculations would be very helpful, and actually very re-usable when implemented in this fashion.<br><br>I'm only going to paste one more implementation that addresses an issue that arises from this type of design:<br><pre class=code>
' a basic controler behavior that could attached.
Type TControllerComponent Extends TComponent
	
	Field _physics:TPhysicsComponent
	
	Method New ()
		SetType("TRobotAIComponent")
	End Method
	
	Method OnAdd(owner:TBaseObject)
		'lets say for example this controller type needs to know the object's velocity to function. lets query for it:
		_physics = TPhysicsComponent(owner.GetComponent("TPhysicsComponent"))
		' now the above is not ideal if you wish to decouple your components. for more information on a solution that'll 
		' solve that look into Data ports:
		' <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1779/implementing_dataports.php" target="_blank">http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1779/implementing_dataports.php</a>
		' these can be easily adapted to the component architecture where the 'baseObject' object is it's own
		' individual data port manager, and components and register/read/write to it's owner's data ports.
	End Method
	
	Method OnRemove()
		
	End Method
	
	Method Update()
		Print "controller update!"
	End Method
End Type
</pre><br>For those just skimming over the code:<br>Sometimes components (for example, a physics component and a collision component) need to communicate with each other in order to function. This is not uncommon, and when doing the 'large class' way it's easy for different sections to communicate. Components are supposed to be a way to de-couple functionality from each other and allow it to be reusable. You could easily 'query' for the dependent components (as above) if you don't care too much about coupling. But if you do then I highly recommend reading this article for a solution to this problem:<br><br><b><a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1779/implementing_dataports.php" target="_blank">Implementing Dataports</a></b><br><br>Ok so that's a quick run down of a way to implement aggregation/components in bmax. Hope it's helpful :).<br><br>The whole compilable bmx file is <b><a href="http://paradeofrain.com/wp-content/uploads/tutorials/components/components.bmx" target="_blank">here</a></b>. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This design is not only great for game logic, but for the structure of the game application itself. I've applied it to my framework and it's been a treat to work with.

Type TBaseObject

   ' Common base object fields

   Field hp : int

   Field container : TContainer
   Field weapon : TWeapon
   Field armor : TArmor
   Field movement : TMove
   Field vehicle : TVehicle

</textarea><br><br>So I would have these other objects ( your compnents ), or pointers to them, defined in my base object in case that particular object needed that functionality. So my Chest entity would have a pointer to TContainer but would not have one to TMove or TVehicle etc.<br><br>What I didn't like is I would end up with a long list of these pointers in my base object and everytime I think of a new one I would have to modify my base class. So your approach functionally ends up the same but I think is much more elegant and probably flexible. I don't have to explicitly code fields for each possible component into my base class.<br><br>If you are inclined to explain other similar types of design patterns and how they are used in BM I would be a big fan of that.
