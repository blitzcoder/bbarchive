I went shopping for a chicken.<br>I had been told to make sure I got a female chicken, (Stupid of me to fall for it I know).<br>(Those who can speak Spanish can see where this is going. And for those who cannot, it works the other way round in English).<br>So.....I went to the market, and asked for a Nice Big Juicy Chicken(fem), (Yes I know I should have asked for una gallina, but its not my first language)<br>The market stall man, (with a perfectly straight face), apologized, told me he only had one, which wasn’t for sale, and directed me to another stall.<br>Nine stalls I went to.
