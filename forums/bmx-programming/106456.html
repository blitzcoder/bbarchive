The confusion can come because in other languages the main thread always needs you ( as a coder ) to define the main thread entry point - ie the main thread function. For eg in c/c++ the main thread function is the 'main(int argc, char *argv[])' function.<br><br>In Blitz languages that main thread function is hidden from you ( to make programming easier, it is also used to get the program name and command line parameters that Blitz languages store for you so that things like AppArgs() works properly ) and, behind the scenes, that main thread then calls your own 'regular code' as if it was a function. When your regular code exits then the program actually drops back into the main thread function ( remember it is hidden from us Blitzers :p ).<br><br>When you create a new thread you need a function that the thread will run. This is the basic mechanics of how multiple 'threads' or multiple 'functions' can be 'selected' to run at the same time. You choose a function for a thread to run - just that in Blitz languages that 'main' function definition is hidden from us.<br><br>Using MainThread() will give you a TThread Object that represents the main thread so that any threads may use it for whatever reason ( including the main thread itself ).<br><br>Threads are fun eh :^) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I always prefer the easiest and simplest that is robust and works accurately.<br><br>When you are using multiple threads then you soon learn that you will need some way to prevent threads accessing the same data at the same time! You mention Global variables, Yes you could do that. But you NEED to know that you can get into bad trouble if more than 1 thread is writing/reading from the same variable at the same time - and with multiple threads sometimes more than 1 thread will access the variable at the same time, sometimes not... you really cannot tell. But always write code that will assume that more than 1 thread is trying to modify a variable at the same time and you will be safe.<br><br>This is where TMutex and TSemaphores can be used as building blocks to prevent two threads from accessing various code at the same time. You should learn how and when to use these as soon as possible. Experiment is best way to learn. You can learn using 1 or 2 threads to see what they do and how they affect the code.<br><br>On the contrary...<br>However with some good planning you can sometimes avoid needed mutex and/or semaphore locks in the first place. Sometimes you just HAVE to use them.<br><br>Using another thread just for loading resources is a very good example where you don't need to use a TMutex for protecting variables ( but I stress... PLEASE learn how they work, when you need them, and how to use them ).<br><br>You will notice that the CreateThread takes a function and an Object in the parameters and also returns an Object too. When you return an Object from the thread function you can get that object by calling WaitThread ( it will return the Object returned by the thread function ). Even if the thread has exited a long time then you can still WaitThread for one time and get the Object returned. However! if the thread has NOT finished then WaitThread will cause your code to wait until the thread has finished, this is where you can use ThreadRunning to know if the thread has finished or not and then use WaitThread to get the Object returned from the thread.<br><br>An example. This code hasn't been tested and should be treated as 'pseudo code' and NOT a working example, although it may work :D<br><textarea class=codebox name="code" wrap=OFF readonly="true" rows="15" cols="80">
