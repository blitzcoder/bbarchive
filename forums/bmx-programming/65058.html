For newcomers, BLIde is a freeware integrated development environment for BlitzMax.<br><br>For more information visit: <a href="http://www.blide.org" target="_blank">http://www.blide.org</a><br><br>There are a lot of changes and improvements in this new version. The full core engine of BLIde has been replaced. (BLIde no longer uses the PuzzleFramework or the Fireball Code Editor). This new core engine is absolutely more stable than the previous one. Read the changelog for more information.<br><br><div class="quote"> <b>All the Out of memory, code editor freeze, and bugs like those, have been completely removed with the new core engine. </b><br><br>BLIde no longer hilites the custom editing scope (this is no longer suported by the new Actipro text render engine) <br><br>BLIde by default works with a reduced set of hilighting keywords, but the non hilighted keywords are case-corrected when you change the line you're editing. (like in visual studio, this reduces A LOT memory usage). <br><br>BLIde perform case-correction when a line of code is fully edited, and not as you type (this also speeds things a lot) <br><br>BLIde now supports different fonts and sizes for different hilighting definitions in the same document. <br>The 'red background mark' is no longer suported, it has been replaced with a wave-line error mark (this is how most pro editors display code errors). <br><br>The find and Replce dialog now has A LOT of extra features <br><br>Now F3 can be used as a 'find next' shortcut <br><br>There have been several improvements on intellisense and project file handling <br><br>There have been several improvements in module inspection <br><br>Autolists now shows quickinfo tips with useful inoformation about the selected item. <br><br>Folded region tips now show hilited text <br><br>Document parsing is done when a document needs to be shown for first time, not when a document is loaded, that reduces drastically the project loading time. <br><br>Fixed a Parsing bug (thanks to barbapapa) <br><br>Improved parsing speed and general loading time <br><br>Fixed a hilighting bug when loading files from windows explorer (thanks to booticus) <br><br>Some additional little fixes <br><br>Fixed a bug on intellisense procesing CONST in very rare occasions. <br><br>Fixed a identation bug on autocompletion (thanks to simesf) <br><br>Absolutely new hilighting system, fully customizable <br><br>Code is now analized using a separated AST technology that informs of bugs in the code (not many bugs recognized yet, but this is being improved). <br><br>The new AST mode allows the creation of the internal code database in a secondary thread, much more accurated and fast. <br><br>Local shortcuts has been redesigned to be part of the editor control, in a pair of combo boxes, a la visual studio. That saves a lot of resources and makes navigation more standard and user friendly. <br><br>Complete new docking system in the end user interface, more intuitive. the HTML window can be converted to a dockable window, or to a tabbed document. <br><br>Fixed some little bugs in previous BETA <br><br>The 'Clear console' button is now on a right-click menu on the console to let more free console space in the window. <br><br>Faster perfomance on big files <br><br>Fixed a little bug on folding regions <br><br>Fixed a little autocompletion bug on extern sections <br><br>Fixed a memory leak <br><br>Fixed a "Globals" internal database very minor bug <br><br>Fixed TAB focus bug, now the focus is set to the editor window when you select a document, instead of being set to the build as combo. <br><br>Fixed a QuickInfo box not desapearing thwn switching tabs <br><br>Fixed a visualization bug on the code window <br><br>Fixed the F3 bug making BLIde crash <br><br>Fixed the bug dialog when opening a BMX file from windows explorer <br><br>New Welcome Window design and functionality <br><br>New tool: User color selector <br><br>Fixed a memory leak, and some little fixings here and there. <br><br>fixed a stability bug that was making BLIde load some BMX file twice. <br><br>Fixed a Folding bug with abstract types<br><br>New Bug-Report mechanism<br><br>New feature: Framework inspector. This tool will let you navigate your currently installed modules, and all its functions, classes and inheritance information. <br></div><br>It is recomended to uninstall any previous version before installing this new one.<br><br>Please, if you test this BLIde version, provide feedback (even if no bugs to coment) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Yay! Thanks, Ziggy; I am eternally grateful.<br><br>This IDE is poised to conquer Visual Studio for top spot! :P<br><br>The load times for this version are quite excellent.

Right now I can't read the Powered part so it drives me a bit crazy :p<br><br><br>Got an unhandled exception from .Net on first run after setting up BLIde, but I hit Continue and it all went fine. I never got the error again. Sorry, I didn't grab any information on it.<br><br><br>Not a big problem, but I'm noticing that the "Customize Editor Colors and Look" and the "Preferences" windows stand out like sore thumbs.

I was playing around with the plugins, and found that if I have any text highlighted and choose any of the the plugins, ('Uppercase Machinne" "lowercase Machinne", or "Ups I'm a C programmer") my highlighted text is completely corrupted to stuff like this:   &amp;#3338;&amp;#8205;&amp;#2640;&amp;#3338;&amp;#21005;&amp;#2633;&amp;#3338;&amp;#19981;&amp;#2644;&amp;#3338;&amp;#8205;&amp;#2594;&amp;#3338;&amp;#19213;&amp;#2629;&amp;#3338;&amp;#21005;&amp;#2640;&amp;#3338;&amp;#19469;&amp;#2639;&amp;#3338;&amp;#19981;&amp;#2635;&amp;#3338;&amp;#8717;&amp;#2573;&amp;#2573;&amp;#2573;&amp;#2638;&amp;#3338;&amp;#17677;&amp;#2648;&amp;#3338;&amp;#21517;&amp;#2573;&amp;#2573;&amp;#2573;&amp;#2629;&amp;#3338;&amp;#19981;&amp;#2628;&amp;#3338;&amp;#8205;&amp;#2630;&amp;#3338;&amp;#21773;&amp;#2638;&amp;#3338;&amp;#17165;&amp;#2644;&amp;#3338;&amp;#18701;&amp;#2639;&amp;#3338;&amp;#19981;<br><br>According to Write, that's in Arial MS Unicode font, but some of the characters are marked as being Chinese, and all of it is completely unreadable.<br><br>If no text is highlighted, then one unprintable character is inserted at the current cursor location.<br><br>2) Some typo's: you misspelled "Machine" in the plugin names, and I assume that you meant "Oops, I'm a C programmer" instead of "Ups"<br><br><br>Now, since I'm typing all of this anyway, here are a couple of ideas for features for the next version:<br><br>1) It would be nice to have a keyboard shortcut to only fold/unfold the current scope that you are in, in addition to the F11 that collapses/restores <i>everything</i><br><br>2) To-do list: you have "pending", "working on it", and "done". Might be nice to also have an option to specify "...% complete"<br><br>3) Save/restore custom layouts<br><br>4) I'm running in 1280x1024, and the icons in the top menu bar really are kind of small looking. Any chance you can also add an option for larger icons, kind of like how internet explorer lets you pick between two icon sizes?<br><br><br>Last but not least -- I seem to remember reading something about Framework Assistant integration a while back on some of the forums. Does that indeed work, and - if so - how do you use it? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I often referred to them to see what I had called variables, functions, etc, and not just as a way of quickly getting to a definition in my file.  I like the drop-downs that have been introduced and I'll use these as a way of navigating my file.  These can't be used as a reference without jumping to the definition, which is not what I want to do.  But anyway, I'll await the shortcut tree's reappearence.<br><br>I don't know if it's just me or not, but the normalising of code doesn't seem to be working correctly for me.  I have it set-up so it uses all BlitzMax modules, but it still does not normalise all keywords.

I'm making a lot of improvements and I've managed to reduce this CPU usage a lot, but the real improvement will come when the dedicated renderer-parser will be finished. It can take a long time to be finished (I think about 4 or 5 months, as it wil be also a compiler-emulator to check for syntax errors or logical warnings in the code, everything based on the AST). Now we have a simple AST implemented and a dynamic lexical parser that uses regual expressions, that can take a little bit of CPU to be calculated. This is what I'm fixing for further releases. Currently, there's only one process being executed (AST syntax chicking). I will add a parameter to manage this secondary AST thread priority. this will let the users manage their CPU resources used by BLIde. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That info is collected 'on the fly' and enables things as 'jump to definition', intellisense, and a lot of the built-in features of BLIde. This background activity can be a little bit CPU demanding on very very large files, or in very old computers, so this button is there to disable this process for a speciffic opened file. In general, you wouldn't have to disable autolearn. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
