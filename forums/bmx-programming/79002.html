Five years of development had converted some areas of the BLIde code a little nightmare to mantain, so I've decided to clean it up as much as possible. Surprisingly, while surfing trough all the code, I've managed to optimize some areas, so BLIde is now a lot faster in some areas. <br><b>Module cache configuration </b><br>I've also added a tool to 'exclude' some modules from the internal BLIde database. The object of this new tool is not to make BLIde faster, as BLIde is not suffering from slowdowns caused for the complexity of the framework. The intention of this is to let users disable intellisense for the modules they doesn't regulary use. I've got 3 3D modules installed and some of them share some base functionality and I was having intellisense from the 3 engines at the same time! A little bit confusing! <br><b>BLIde SDK generates native .net DLL files</b> <br>The SDK can now generate native compiled .net DLLs to add functionality to BLIde. I'm more than happy with this part and that has improved BLIde loading time, and making the plugins source code more secure. <br><b>New SDK components and functionality</b> <br>I've added a new component to the BLIde SDK that lets the SDK coder create tabbed documents in the BLÏde layout, as any other existing BLIde tool, and this is done in a complete transparent way for the Plugin users. I've also added a way to provide some basic intellisense to non bmx or sdk files, using the SDK. the final goal is that BLIde will be able to be configured to act as an IDE for virtually any language. Next step will be to add function parameter hint through the SDK and folding, and then... the parsers... a lot of pending work to do!!!... <br><b>Better intellisense</b> <br>Also, I've made some improvements to the intellisense system. It is now a little bit faster and it is even more precise. <br><b>Improved localisation</b> <br>Additionaly, I've changed the Ctrl+Enter functionality to Alt+Enter, as the Ctrl+Space is being used by chinese users to toggle the multilingual imput text mode (wich BLIde now supports nativelly. <br><b>New customer tool </b><br>I've also added a new little information tool in the Help panel that informs about the version number of any BLIde component installed. This tool is there just as a customer's support helper, so I can know what assemblys are being used with BLIde when a BLIde customer reports a bug. <br><b>Optimized layout serialization for projects and solutions</b><br>New system for session serialization, this new system has forced some changes in the internl BLIde and bls files formats. Now BLIde remembers the documents organization when the session is restored, including dual monitor setups configurations and complex multi-container layouts. <br><b>Changes introduced on version 0.9.54-B</b><br>Lots of fixes in the serialization algorithm that were affecting the creation of new Solutions, Projects and the restoriation of previously stored layouts on the window menu. Some of this fixes were serious stability fixes. Updating is highly recommended. <br><b>Changes introduced on version 0.9.54-C</b> <br>Several otimizations on the intellisense speed. This optimizations are specially notorious on single core processors <br>Implemented internal file system watcher to detect changes on files being edited in several instances of BLIde or being edited from several programs at the same time. <br>Fixed some stability fixes on session status serialization <br>Added the view BLIde help and view BlitzMax help on the Help menu <br>Several fixes when mixing non-project related files with project/solution files in the same BLIde session and the session was restoring a serialization that included tabbed documents <br>Improved a little bit the BLIde start-up time on dual core systems <br>Some minor improvements on the TabControl component of the BLIde SDK <br>Tweaked the integrated plublisher to be compatible with the inminent release of BlitzMax 1.30 that has special attention to internal manifest files integration (that one was not very easy to do...9 <br>The advanced module builder no longer depends on module cache, it takes the mods list directly from disk, so non active modules can also be build <br>Some internal improvements to the BLIde SDK to make existing API faster. A lot to do still in this area... <br>Organized the quick-info tooltips on code to make them look the same in every possible scenario <br> <br><b>Changes introduced on version 0.9.55-A</b> <br>Better intellisense (more precise and a little bit faster) <br>I've been fixing lots of small issues reported by users during this week. Everything starts to shape and the next beta 0.9.55 A seems to be very stable, so time to let it go and prepare an official update. <br>I've improved the way BLIde internally handles GDI resources to follow strict microsoft GDI+ rules. <br>I've fixed an issue with incbined media on solutions when a complex folder structure was pressent. <br>fixed also some issues on the code text auo-format algorithm <br>Fixed some issues on the inline bug analizer, interpreting complex IF single line sentences when using a NOT operator as the first operator of a sub-expression. <br>Fixed a compatibility issue with some third party modules (wxwidgets) <br>Improved start-up time a little bit <br>Several stability issues on the internal GUI engine <br>Improved intellisense mechanism (faster and more precise) <br>Added little funcionality to the SDK api <br>Updated some internal BLIde DLLs to fix some GDI+ issues  <br></div><br><br>BLIde Plus users can download the beta here: <a href="http://www.blide.org/plus/" target="_blank">http://www.blide.org/plus/</a><br>BLIde Free edition users can download the beta here: <a href="http://www.blide.org/index.php?section=getfree" target="_blank">http://www.blide.org/index.php?section=getfree</a><br><br>Please, if you test this version, provide feedback. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I could add an additional compile options tab where you can literally TYPE any additional compilation flag you want to pass to the bmk. This could be set on the Advanced tab of the IDE preferences. What do you think? <br>You can add any file extension to any available BLIde parser in the file / settings menu. Select the parser at the left, and add a file extension. Then this file extension will be available on the Open File of BLIde. Also to the compiling DLLs, I don't think there's any official support for this and I'm not sure if BLIde should support user-made tweaks to the BlitzMax compiler. If there's a way to compile DLLs using BlitzMax with doesn't requiere a change in the BMK utility, please let me know it and I'll add it to BLIde. To the version numbering on a project; if your project is a solution, you can set version numbering in the properties window of any managed program on the solution. If the project is not a managed project, you can set a version number in the project info dialog, but in this case the versioning will not be reflected at runtime, and the users shuold check it by themselves.<br><br>@Czar Flavius: A truly automatic indenting system would mean reparse all the code at every line change, and that would have a very performace impact on BLIde. I'm making some changes in the internal parser structure to make this faster, but I'm not sure if this will be possible. Even Visual Studio have some issues with this... I will fix the non-autocompletion of types or the like as soon as I can see what's causing them. And to the automatic capitalisation... It is there, not sure what can be happening to you if you don't have it! If you create a type with a given name, and then after you write the type name somewhere else, it is not capitalized? Let me know it please. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The idea behind this was to let the free edition to open source projects or free projects as BLIde is taking a lot of time of developmet and I think the small amount the plus version costs is usually one or two sells of any comercial game or application. I'm sure people that really valorate the amount of work involved on making and mantaining BLIde will have no problem with this.

I supose this change can be caused by the scroll wheel of the mouse when the combo has focus or something like that.
