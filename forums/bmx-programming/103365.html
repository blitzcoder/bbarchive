That way the base IDE, compiler, and engine could not only be open source but can still be sold for the benefit of continuing to support Blitz Research to a degree, which I find to be much better than making no money from it at all. Blitz Research should still be making some form of income from BlitzMax closed source or not.<br><br>The linking exception is a real can of worms for someone like me who knows nothing about this kind of stuff, but from what I've heard this can let the software stay open source while still allowing users to compile games that are commercial and closed source without needing to provide their games source nor be required to credit Blitz Research for the production of their app or game if they so desire.<br><br>This is all high pathetical, but it's still worth proposing because we don't know what Mark is planning as he already released the source of two of his products without telling anyone he was planning to do that beforehand.<br><br>What do you think?

There are Gountries like Germany, which do not have legal definitions of "Public Domain" (you cannot put something into "Public Domain", but you can grant everyone an unlimited and unrestricted right to do everything they want with it).<br><br>This means, there are surely also countries not accepting the GPL - so they could do whatever they want with your code, they (their people) should just avoid visiting other countries to avoid getting sued while there.<br><br><br>There are also countries enforcing you write in your licence that you wont be liable for damages etc. Normally this is not needed: humans have brains to use for things like "think before doing" (cat in the microwave).<br>I do not know many countries with manuals next to weapons in the likes of "do not fire when having the gun turned 180 degrees".<br><br>So "warranty" and "liability" are just needed for the sold product in the case of the product itself can create danger. But as it is the "use", I think this is another story.<br><br>Enough ranted versus "licences".<br><br><br>GPL is fine for many things - especially for the helpers, as "custom licences" may contain "ambiguity" or other things which might create incertitude on the side of the helpers.<br>There are surely even coders ignoring "non [l]gpl"-projects.<br><br>Also things like linux distributions require specific licences (real "FOSS") to add projects to their repos.<br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
