Thanks!<br><br>With on-site repository do you mean the Maximus website should provide SCM? Because I don't think there's any need for that. There are enough free SCM providers out there. Or do you mean simply hosting the source of a release, like CPAN?<br><br>The searchable docs speak for them self. The Maximus website, or service rather I guess, will be and should be a lot like CPAN.<br><br>I wonder how important it'll be for the site to be multilingual but I guess it wouldn't hurt to keep all links, menu's etc. localized.<br><br>User-driven release process, that's fine, but when a module is hosted inside a public Subversion or Git repository we can make use of tag detection.<br><br>Another note, why teams? Is it to have multiple release maintainers?<br><br>+1 for the dependency and platform tables by the way.<br><br>Considering Kohana. I've heard of it but never used it before. Although I use Zend Framework at work I'm not very happy with how Zend is pushing version requirements and it almost seems like only paid requests are being processed. There are quite some bugs, mostly minor, that are around for ages but simply being ignored. They also don't really care about breaking backwards compatibility.<br><br>What does the <b>H</b> in HMVC stand for by the way?<br><br>I don't know about Kohana's ORM capabilities but for Perl there's DBIx::Class which is very powerful and easy to use. Also comes with DDL upgrading capability which is nice for upgrading when scaling to multiple servers will be required. Catalyst, currently the most popular MVC framework for Perl has a lot of extensions and is very powerful. But it can be a bit of a dependency hell. There's also Mojolicious, which takes away the dependency hell by being self contained.<br><br>A service like this will need to run quite some background jobs and I'm not convinced PHP is suitable for this. But please, do prove me wrong if php-cli has improved over the last years.<br><br>For a project like this a stable and good codebase is required. DBIx::Class and Catalyst are just that. Catalyst has plugins for authentiication, authorization and ACL, REST, XML-RPC and what not. These have been very well tested. Kohana's ORM library seems very light/limited compared to DBIx::Class.<br><br>I don't want to write off Kohana right away, but the project still seems very young. Having over 3 major releases (1.x, 2.x, 3.x) in only 3 years doesn't look good to me. I can be wrong, but Maximus is supposed to run for a long time, if the core libraries it's running on changes it's API every year we won't get a lot of happy maintainers. That's time being spend on keeping the site compatible with the codebase, instead of being able to improve the service.<br><br>Just my 2 cents :-). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In theory this would be enough for maximus to work with. So that's what I'm aiming for first. After that comes the website itself.<br><br>By fetching updates from SCM repositories modules will be kept up to date, automatically.

It's been a while since I last posted in this topic but that doesn't mean that Maximus is dead. Unfortunately, due to health issues I'm unable to make much progress on the website. It still needs proper module management and the front-end for SCM auto discovery needs to be done. Auto discovery of modules in multi module hosted repositories (such as duct.mod and bah.mod) works, but lacks the interface to add the modules.<br><br>To keep going forward though I've put the current version online on my VPS and it can be reached at <a href="http://maximus.htbaa.com" target="_blank">maximus.htbaa.com</a>. It should be online 24/7. This means the sources list and archives should always be available. Currently only my modules (htbaapub.mod) are online and are being automatically updated. I could add others for the time being as well, but would like it if each author would create his or her own account and add the SCM configurations to his or her account.<br><br>If and when my hands allow it I'll try to add the missing functionality. If time allows it as well. Until then I ask of you to be patient. If not... Well... Try contributing :-). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So far we haven't had any response and my last post was over 3 weeks ago. Which makes us wonder if anything like this is wanted at all.<br><br>The current status of the project is that the website is considered stable and can provide all that's required for the client. The client still needs a little bit of work to make it fully usable, and a lot more to make a user friendly (binary and installable) distribution out of it.<br><br>The thing is, the project probably won't get the required effort and polish to make it a lot more user-friendly for the general user if no one's interested. If that's the case then why put any effort in it at all?<br><br>So it kind of depends on the interest of the community in this project. Even if there's not interest at all I (and/or perhaps Plash) most likely will put in the effort to get the client in a state where it can successfully install and update modules. If there's hardly any or no interest I'll most likely take the website down and host it in my local network, unavailable for the outside world. I can use my server resources for other stuff. There'll probably be no binary client available as well. Still, the sourcecode is freely available under the MIT license so anyone could in theory host his own module archive and compile the client himself.<br><br>PS: I understand that due to the length of this topic not everyone knows what's going on or what Maximus is all about. It does however seems a bit early to make an official announcement on the frontpage when there's no binary for the client ready yet. Because without the client, all you can do is download modules manually and install them by hand. Any thoughts and feedback on this will be much appreciated. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I proposed an annual subscription model for BMax but was shouted down by the majority here.  I believe more free Modules would be paid (and maintained) if there were some repeat income potential.<br><br>Looking back on 29 years of programming, way too much time/effort was wasted switching languages!  My recent app/game programming has been mostly hobby.<br><br>PS:  Just to be clear regarding the subscription idea, you would be able to use whatever you purchased forever.  If Windows, Apple, or Linux breaks what was previously working with new OS versions, you would have to pay for BMax/Module updates following one year of free updates. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Concerning Mercurial, I have a <a href="https://github.com/maximos/maximus-web/issues/51" target="_blank">ticket open</a> on that one. I have zero experience with Mercurial, but figure the process is much like Git. If you know a little bit of Perl you could give it a go if you want by taking a look at the <a href="https://github.com/maximos/maximus-web/blob/master/lib/Maximus/Class/Module/Source/SCM/Git.pm" target="_blank">Git driver</a>.<br><br>I have yet to install Mercurial and haven't had much time for it yet. Might plan some time on it soon though and stick it in the 1.0.0 release. But no guarantees on that.<br><br>Concerning the client, Plash told me he no longer has any interest on working on Maximus. For several reasons, but the main reason being he no longer uses BlitzMax anymore. Which is fine and I can fully understand. I'd like to thank him for his immense contributions to the project.<br><br>With that it means that the Maximus client no longer has a core developer. I do intend to pick it up and continue work on it. But welcome the help of anyone else.<br><br>I am happy to see there are at least several positive replies in here which show there's still interest in this project :-). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
