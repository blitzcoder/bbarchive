Some introductory articles <a href="http://t-machine.org/index.php/2007/09/03/entity-systems-are-the-future-of-mmog-development-part-1/" target="_blank">here</a> and a decent series <a href="http://t-machine.org/index.php/2007/09/03/entity-systems-are-the-future-of-mmog-development-part-1/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>The big win is in terms of abstract architecture. You get away from the mess caused by inheritance, and move closer towards the kind of flexible, omnidirectional relationship graph your game logic probably actually embodies.<br><br>The downside is that performance may suffer for small games, and is quite likely to suffer for large games thanks to huge amounts of wasted memory and fragmentation - to get actual performance <i>improvements</i>, you need a lot of low-level runtime support code and quite possible a component-aware language/compiler (which Max is not).<br><br>The tradeoff therefore is that you get a much better high-level abstract design for your overall game architecture, at the cost of a very messy low level of implementation code that might become easy to get bogged down in. <i>Avoid thinking about code</i> (like TMaps vs. TLists for implementing entities) - this system is for very high-level organisation of your project, and to see the advantages you need to be working mostly or entirely outside the entities themselves, using high-level generic procedures to build your program logic. In practice you probably wouldn't implement a full entity system, simply so that the low level stays manageable and still uses some native objects (maybe a half-system over the top of a small set of classic-OOP components).<br><br>It has some similarities to "generic method"-based OOP as exemplified in CLOS, where the methods exist outside the classes. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The alternative to a dynamic wrapping class is then to have a function changing all available strings - or to send out an event so that all objects handle it on their own.

Alternatively use a Color-Collection and store the id of the color in each entity -- seems there is in many cases a diversity of options available).<br><br><br>So back to my original question: does the component based approach add more than "memory usage" - especially when using "getters/setters" in both cases?

And seemingly cause very little performance overhead.  I can see how it might become a cache thrashing issue though to have a list of objects, each of which is getting passed a pointer to parent and then acting on the parent.  My guess is that runtime creation of these object trees might be slow if there were more than a few nodes.<br><br>The sorts of apps I am writing are typically well within performance tolerances, and are frankly at the very low end (even a raspberry pi laughs at early 80s arcade games.  Even emulated). My main question is what sorts of productivity gains and low hanging fruit emerge from runtime composition (rather than compile time which I already use.). <br><br>It's sort of a conceptual headache but I suppose I'm using it already with a Renderables list and an Updatables list, sort of.  It's also looking like there are lots of ways of doing it, like having a list of function pointers, which I'm thinking would be much less processor intensive.  I guess I just don't like the idea of passing a parent pointer to a child component and having the child act on the parent, it seems to break encapsulation, but maybe I am wrong about that.<br><br>And certainly old fashioned.

This kind of paradigm shift seems to get harder every time.<br><br>Back to performance of components, I've been doing things with inheritance hierarchies at a 2x2 pixel block level for 640x480 windows and I didn't notice any slowdown from that, but I suppose I could time that with both flat arrays ( r[],g[],b[]) and runtime aggregation, to see if there's any substantial difference. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

</pre><br><br>If you want multiple components of 1 type you need to introduce arrays for each type (tmap-&gt; key|componentArray[]).<br><br>Generally you might want to have a look at Artemax (to not reinvent the wheel :P):<br><a href="/posts.php?topic=97192" target="_blank">Community/posts.php?topic=97192</a><br><br><br>@networking/ai<br>I connected them via "events" - my game creates events (or the specific functions emit events). My network handler listens to everything of interest and handles it then. A generic "network component" ... dunno how this should work for diversive objects ... some contain fields to share, some contain lists not to share if longer than X etc. . So you end up writing multiple components extending the "networkbaseComponent" just to handle specific objects. <br>Think at the end the workload for us coders is the same: if we use approach A or B does not matter :p.<br><br><br>@Yasha<br>With overhead I meant things like this: BlitzMax does not "optimize out" a single line Getter (Method GetX(); return x; EndMethod). But I do not know how much has to get done to pass something via a parameter. So I do not know if accessing a field-referenced object's method is less expensive than a parameter passed object:<br><br><pre class=code>
Type blubb
...
End Type

Type bla
  field parent:blubb

  Method Run:int(paramParent:blubb)
    paramParent.do()
  End Method

  Method Run2:int()
    parent.do()
  End Method
End Type
</pre><br><br><br>Of course the param one avoids the potential circular reference - but does not allow for "picking" an object and traverse back along the ancestors - eg you got hit by a bullet and want to know which enemy shot you (which then needs the collection I spoke about at the beginning of my post).<br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
