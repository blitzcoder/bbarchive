Each time the game is run on a system, it would 'phone home' and the IP address and reg key would be logged in a database.  The same reg key being used from more than a couple of different IPs would be flagged as 'suspicious', and a notification e-mail sent to both me, and [possibly] the original purchaser of that key.  From there I can disable a registration key or lock it to a single IP (with wildcard support for dynamic IPs), and any further attempts to use that key will result in the game being disabled. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
