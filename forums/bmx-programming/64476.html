So ive moved all the methods of that type to my players ship type. The type which i Base the player ship off of, which is extended by an enemyship type for enemy ships.<br><br>So am I correct that by using SELF while programming the AI functions/routines/methods that I can get any object of the current type once the condition has been reached, to invoke the said invisible methods on the object that called it?<br><br>so say ship A is damaged and wants to go invisible, the code to go invsisible will only work on Ship A because his condition is met and only the instance of Ship A uses the code because I use self in the routine to go invisible, which by using SELF it provides a way for a method to refer to the instance of the type that called the method. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Perhaps it's when I have a local variable in a method called X or something, and then I want to access the type's X field so I've used self.x.  But that would be pretty lame code...<br><br>Aha just searched my code, and the most common use is when I have extended TList and I want to loop through it so I do For Local o:TObject = eachin self for example.<br><br>Also sometimes I have a list of objects and I want the objects to reference the list, so when I make a new object via the list (say with a method called AddNewObject), I set a field on the object to be Self (which is the list).  Then later I can get the object to remove itself from the list by looking at its field which references the list and then calling TheList.Remove(self) which removes the object.  Hmm I'm probably not being very clear, but yeah it can be useful.<br><br>A final use is, say a method on a Type calls an external function that you've designed to work on that sort of type, and the function needs one of those types passed into it as a parameter, well you can pass the parameter in as self of course! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But as said above self within a method means "The object that called the method". IT dosnt work for function within a type, because they are called by the type and not an instance of the type. So even if you went object.AFunctionofTypeA, although it looks like you have called the function with object you havent you have called it with the type A.<br><br>Also, errrm dont now how to ask this.

Currently the way I handle them is entirely abstract, without the creation of objects. So there is an engine_health variable, and max speed is calculated based on its health, so if it is damaged less than full health, the max speed is slower.
