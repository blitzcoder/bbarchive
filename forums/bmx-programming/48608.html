Garage games are well connected in the industry and are business partners with ATI, Nvidia, Apple and joined the Xbox 360 program. As well as Xbox and PS2. <br><br>To do that you need good marketing, industry connections and experience in commercial game dev. BLitz hasn't really got much of either of these things and mostly seen as a hobby development system by the vast majority. So getting there is going to be a lot of work. Don't think its out of the question though. If your indie game is good enough and sells enough copies, MS will come looking for you.<br><br>Bmax has the best chance of success but I doubt blitz3d will as you need lower level hardware access to get some things runnig on Xbox to MS spec in order to pass Q&amp;A testing. Which is pretty hard. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Particularly with MS supplying indies with the hardware to port their games for free. Not sure how long that will last :) but currently they want to introduce new games monthly.

It's the DS that has 4 mb). Allright, system speed would be an issue, but since you seem to judge the quality of games by what else there is, and you believe that games made on a low-mid-range PC are "not good" <i>how could a <b>more</b> powerful system possibly change things?</i>.<br>Building on your thought that a game's quality is all about what else there is for the system it's built for, the graphics quality of many games made by single developers here and elsewhere is often equal to that of games for the current two main handheld consoles. Sure, it would take some work to get one of those games on there, but the media (which is, eventually, the main driving force behind the graphics quality) could stay pretty much identical.<br><br><br><br>I'm sorry to have subjected everyone to a mindless bit of dreaming for something that would never happen. I would have shut up three posts ago had my post not been misread.<br><br>Now, back to sensible wishes that <i>do</i> have some chance of ever happening. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
