If you add a platform you would either need to be sure that it supported the whole command set that currently works on Mac/Linux/Windows, or you would have to alter the commant set on all platforms. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

When making console games you need to get licenced pay a fortune for the dev kits, and then pass Q&amp;A testing (expensive) where the console manufacturer decides if your software is worthy of their platform. You have to go through Q&amp;A at leat twice and  as they will allways find problems with the first submission, (quite often how games are saved probs if nothing else).<br><br>And then each game developed for that platform has to go through the same process. I'm not sure it's really worth the trouble, unless BRL had a seperate pricing scheme for commercial games on consoles. Like $10,000 per title so that after several commercial games were published they might cover their costs on developing the language for that platform.<br><br>Thats kind of how I would see it working, unless Microsoft had something like their old incubator program again, where you got 6 months to prove yourself, and $1000 per dev kit. <br><br>I suppose with their wanting new games monthly for their Xbox live arcade service. There may be a way in there somewhere.<br><br>As for Sony, they are really hard to do business with as they don't like talking to developers, they prefer to talk directly through your publisher, and and seem to try their best to ignore developers.<br><br>Thats what I made out from my experiences with a mid size development studio in the past. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
