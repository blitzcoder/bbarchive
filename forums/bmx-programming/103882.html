Because the multithreading-model of parallelism isn't actually a fundamental paradigm shift/gamechanger technology. You're still programming sequentially, but with a small advantage gained from having a tiny handful of sequential programs running at once. However, fundamentally, this model doesn't scale. You can make great use of four cores, pretty decent use of 8 or 16, but once you get to 32 or 64 you're really running out of things to do in one program that's still fundamentally structured around long sequential operations on broad and loose and <i>uneven</i> data structures. That article only really splits the engine in a very coarse/highlevel way, into a half dozen large task groups <i>that are still fundamentally sequential</i>. You can split some of them further, but by the logic that leads to task-based division of structure you end up with tighter and tighter data coupling the more finely you try to divide a task area (e.g. "physics" can be split off from "graphics" easily, but trying to split an active simulation in two requires much more synchronisation).<br><br>My thinking is that the real way forward is vectorising everything, i.e. push all the major data crunching onto the GPU or GPU-like devices (like future expansions of AVX), for massive, low-level parallelism <i>within single tasks</i> - this flips the axes somewhat, as tasks become compressed in time and expand in breadth, and reduces the need for multiple processors to engage for one program (can go back to sequencing them at the program toplevel). Vectorisation is infinitely expandable in its axis (as GPUs are enthusiastically demonstrating), as long as you can redesign the basic architecture of your task to involve functionally pure execution units on rigidly structured data without sharing. This requires abandoning a lot of traditional gamedev code and data structures (i.e. deep instruction sequences operating for nondeterministic loops over trees), but it <i>can</i> be done for all simulation and logic code.<br><br><b>Edit:</b> the correct term for the "flipped axis" which I forgot while writing this is "data parallelism" as opposed to "task parallelism". <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It was just a way to certificate that compilers were not good enough at that moment.<br>You can code with the idea of making this kind of optimization more likely to happen, in the same way you avoid the creation of garbage on GC languages, etc, but lots of the time, the compiler is smarter than you! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Personally I'm not aware of any language runtimes that can actually do that at the moment though (GCC and LLVM still struggle to spot vectorisation opportunities at the moment that aren't either hinted or blatantly obvious; JS doesn't even try). Not sure the compilers are as smart as all that yet.<br><br>The thing about vectoring - as opposed to threading - is that it requires all operation channels to be <i>identical</i>. This makes handling the code easy for a machine because dependencies are easy to work out, but actually applying said code is only possible for data structured in certain ways. (e.g. it's easy to mistakenly write OpenCL code that never parallelises at all.)<br><br>You're definitely right about one big point though: thinking about <i>enabling optimization</i> is still the archaic way to design. The gamechanger would be programmers <i>not</i> thinking about writing code that <i>prevents</i> optimization: in the same way that inlining is easy with current programs/languages because nobody directly manipulates the stack with `volatile auto` variables or whatever any more, vectoring would be easy in a future language/style where people don't even try to write to shared globals or run data-dependent loops and the like, because they're used to getting the job done with a uniform dataflow; not even thinking in terms of mutable shared memory, just as coders in current GC languages don't usually think about the fact that object lifetimes end any more.<br><br><br>An analogy (not related to parallelism): code would be "better" in general if everyone used a const-by-default style. Not because languages with that are easier to optimise, or because the compiler can't spot variables that are never mutated - but because if everyone worked without the idea of reusing variables unless absolutely necessary, they'd <i>think</i> in terms of a cleaner flow graph in the first place. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

As ziggy says above, the compiler is smarter than you.
