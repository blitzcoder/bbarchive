The difficult part is generating sudoku's that have only 1 unique solution and have symmetrical clues and varying diffficulty levels.  I have this all done and it was quite time consuming.

That's what I meant by "fast enough".  It has to solve it so many times when  generating one.<br><br>It can't do symmetrical clues, but I think it would take a lot more time to generate a puzzle if you wanted to do that.  I guess some people try to get it symmetrical and then add a few non-symmetrical clues as needed to "fix" it.  <br><br>But if you wanted a specific pattern, that might involve generating puzzles and then seleting all the squares outside the pattern and checking to see if the puzzle then has one solution.  If not, generate a whole new puzzle.<br><br>Not too difficult, but I don't know how fast it would be.  Alternatively I guess you could write a different sort of "solver" which permutates through all possible values, and at each juncture, checks to see if the resulting puzzle has one solution.  I'm really not convinced that would be faster though.  It might even be slower.  Because now instead of creating a set of clues that you know generate one or more valid solutions, you're now generating clues which may have no solution at all.  And that could well force the solver to try every single combination of numbers, which would take a very long time even for a single try. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

My sudoku solver ALSO solves ALL GRIDS.<br><br>Oh, did I forget to mention it has to solve them one at a time?  Oopsie!  <br><br>The same goes for this guy's solver.  You can't solve all grids simultaneously.  That would take a trillion terrabytes of memory and a quantum computer. :-)<br><br>What was neat about what the guy did was he applied a sudoku-like solving algorithm to the problem of solving the offsets of the waves for an inverse fourier transform.  And the way he did that, was by figuring out that he could specify the solution to the puzzle as being one where all spaces outside some object in the center should be 0.<br><br>I'm not sure though what rule this guy applied to make this work.  I don't undertsand fourier well, but it seems like one would not get 0's around the edges until one had added up a lot of waves.  And that's no good, because then you might have to do some weird minimuzing algorithm which just finds the number that brings you closest to the solution, and who knows if that's possible.  This guy, apparently, but not I. :-)<br><br>Anyway when i read that article I wondered if perhaps it would have applications in deblurring images. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
