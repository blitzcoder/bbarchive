Segfaults and heap corruption ahoy. (Although admittedly an unlikely scenario simply because of how uncommon it is to actually use Array as the type for anything.)<br><br>Thinking about it some more, my guess is that the motivating design issue was that you need to be able to cast down past the "created type" of an array in order for TList.ToArray to work: since it doesn't know the type of the TList's elements, it can only directly create the returned array as an Object[] (that there being a solid argument for having generics in a language).<br><br>However, that doesn't explain why there's a) no check of element types even in Debug mode (I could see it being left off for performance in Release mode), and b) why Array doesn't perform the same check as Object, since there's no clear obstacle to doing so and it clearly works in at least one place. The check is clearly possible since arrays work correctly with EachIn.<br><br>EDIT: actually no they don't... add this to the above example:<br><br><pre class=code>Print "eachin (correct):"
For Local x:c = EachIn arr5
	Print x.i
Next

Print "eachin (incorrect):"
For Local x:c = EachIn arr2
	Print x.i
Next</pre><br><br>EachIn arr5 works correctly, as the requested element type is a subtype of the declared array type (Object[]) and it performs the check and never prints anything. EachIn arr2 appears to skip the test as the array is already typed "correctly" for the requested elements (c[]) - this would be a legitimate optimization, if it weren't for the above example showing that you can't always rely on the elements being that type! (OK the optimization is still legit, the problem is that the above issue re-breaks it) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
