Thanks for the suggestions one and all!<br><br>I did think about having a common method within each type that returns some kind of identifying information, but then I realized you can't get to the method to call it because you have to cast the object to a valid type before it even knows that the object is a custom type, rather than an array or something. So methods within the type are out of the question. Then I thought that would be slow and pointless anyway because you might as well just store the `kind` as a data field somewhere.<br><br>Then I did think, okay, well maybe let's have a `kind` identifier somewhere, whether it be stored along with the object in a custom type (as above), or in some array or other linked list, or in a custom linked list structure. But then this does lead to the obvious problem that you're going to have to basically do a search operation using IF's or Select/Case to match up the kind with the type of object so that you can cast it back properly. Regardless of those who would say this is not a lot of overhead, it rubs harshly against my optimized assembly programming background and I just don't think it's very efficient to be in the position of `not knowing` what kind the object is and having to figure it out each time. That's too much overhead for me (just my preference).<br><br>As to the function pointer idea, it might have some merit, but why bother having a `kind` field if you could just store the function pointer there. Ie hard-wire-in the function with the object. This would at least skip all the if-then-else malarky. So then the given function would be a special form of a function just for that data type, but.... the function is now outside of the object (since there's no method pointers - but I did have a solution for that, albeit a little indirect).<br><br>Another issue that comes to mind is the question of what actual purpose/benefit I would have from finding out the type at all.<br><br>What I'm aiming to do is have generic data, e.g. a byte array containing any kind of data, and then have many different custom types that can take that byte array as a field and then work on it, while also having other types that use the same byte array but obviously doing different things with it and `viewing` it as having a different meaning. e.g. one type thinks the array contains an image, another type thinks the array contains audio samples (just a wild example). I figured the ideal way to store the data generically is a linked list of byte arrays. Then I want to have a linked list of custom types that point to the objects from the data list, using it for whatever purpose. The question remains, how to then activate or use the types and their methods, for which I figured I would need to know first of all what type it is. If I have some kind of script system that needs to, for example, use a bunch of `picture` types, which point to byte arrays that contain generic data, how would the script know to deal with only the picture types and not the audio types? So obviously I need somewhere to either store data describing what type it is to translate it back, or use some clever technique that preserves the type when it becomes an object.<br><br>I think one of the problems is I'm thinking of things in terms of a) knowing the object type, b) going into the type and calling specific methods - as if the program flow is centered on the object. I think this is a misthought on my part, because program flow is going to be based on a script program or an array/list holding a custom sequence of objects. Maybe then I only need to know the object type when looking for objects to include in the programs activities, rather than that the objects need to magically execute themselves?<br><br>I'm starting to think there are some aspects to `object orientation` that are backwards. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
