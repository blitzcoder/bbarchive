I need accelerated 2D and effects and want to be able to create normal (or custom) gui's to build serious 3D applications with. I don't mind paying for an engine, but since i'll be spending 100's of hours working on it, I'd like to be reasonably sure it works in the first place and will be updated over the time to come (no dead ends).<br><br>I've browsed and read for days on the forums and checked all the listed 3D engines. Some are dodgy or haven't given any sign of life for many months up to a year.<br><br><br>So far I've narrowed it down to:<br><br>IrrLicht Engine<br>Features looks very very interesting but the screenshots look like 5 year old DX7 shots, how's that? Is there an active BMax community? Where can I find sample code? <br><br>Leadwerks Engine<br>Looks very proffesional and seems to be actively supported here. Heard some sounds that it might be a bit too heavy for some systems?<br><br>TrueVision3D Engine<br>Also looks interesting but is still still kept up to date? Been reading mixed signals and unsure if this is actually an actively supported product.<br><br>Flow3D<br>Heard about people using it, looks good as well, is it any good? Many people using this?<br><br>Any comments, feedback or experience on any of these engines would be greatly appreciated.

It's actively being tested, developed and supported right here on Blitz, it is fully cross platform, the code archives are filled with examples, and (from what I understand) it is so close to B3D that many tutorials and examples can easily be converted to work with miniB3D.<br><br>I want to embrace Leadwerks, but the Windows exclusivity and steep system requirements scare me. At the very least I need to see this running on Mac before I can use it.<br><br>Flow looks like a possibility, but like Leadwerks, until their Mac version is running I can't take it seriously.<br><br>Every other module seems to have dodgy support from their creator. I absolutely cannot invest time in a 3D engine, just to run into a major problem 12 months into development and not have ongoing support to help me. That kills nearly every other engine for me. Many people make a wrapper, throw it out there, and then just forget about it. I can't go for that.<br><br>So, minB3D is what I am focusing on for a future engine. There are a lot of tricks that can be used to make the old engine look good, and when it comes to indie games, it's not about eye candy, but about gameplay. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
