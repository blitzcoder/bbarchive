Not even very interesting experiments- e.g., last night got method invocation working using FFI (I didn't like the way the reflection module worked - you have a limited number of arguments and it's pretty basic), and that's stupidly simple.  It had some purpose or other, but I can't remember what it was.<br><br>At the least, it's good for testing various ideas I have.  No need to fiddle with makefiles (usually) or picking how I want to use strings or writing a ton of utility functions ahead of time (I've had a ton of different 'common.c' files, somehow I always end up rewriting them).  It just has a lot of stuff right there to use, thankfully, so I don't have to worry about details like that.  Ruby has supplanted BMax for anything dealing with string manipulation though - that's the only area where I just don't like working in BMax lately.<br><br>I really like working with Objective-C and Ruby for the most part these days.  Ruby's just fantastic for getting something working quickly, and with its flexibility there's no end to the neat things you can do with it.  Objective-C is pretty similar to Ruby in a lot of respects, and working with Cocoa under Mac OS is really pleasant so far.  Downside to both is that I don't think they're really suitable for realtime work, but I don't do much of that anymore - it's fun to mess with, but writing applications is pretty interesting.<br><br>I'd use BlitzMax for something more advanced again, but I can't seem to find any motivation to work on any projects anymore.  Spent so much time studying other things at school and not working on code that I lost most of what I'd learned on my own, so I mostly just tinker around and look useless while making art for other projects.<br><br>There are obviously things BMax could use (ternary operator being the tiniest, most useless request I'll mention anymore), but that's neither here nor there. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The way Director works, interpreted code, it was okay but also not a screamer as well. I then searched for other options and then found out about Blitz. BlitzMax wasn't released those days. I bought a Mac for Unity and when BlitzMax was ready i instantly bought it and it felt like a dream. Due to the hw acceleration things were running a lot faster on the old PPC Mac than on the way faster PC and the basic felt simple but effective and overall round to me.<br> <br>What i really love about BlitzMax is that for me it kind of draws a connection between my past, mostly my youth in the Amiga days and the present were quite a lot of stuff is going more and more loco. It's a silent product (not yelling at me in terms of advertisements and superlatives, like Unity does, although sometimes i wish there would be just a liitle bit more attention to this), it's small, useable, easy to code in, sexy language, crossplatform, hardware accelerated, extremely affordable, comes with a generous licence, has a weird community which is different to other forums, sources can be exchanged very easily via the forum, stuff like that.<br><br>I would love it even more if there would be more force behind the product, a roadmap, quite some things would be nice to have on the 2d rader, a proper brl 3d engine, support for the iPhone and a Debugger which is worth it's name, less paternalism on the forum.<br><br>Great product, i recommend it everytime it makes sense. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
