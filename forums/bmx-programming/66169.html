However, it isn't possible and not just because BMX doesn't support function overloading - even if Max2 would ever support this, you'd still have no way to implement it as proper function. You would have to write the Len function to accept strings. Ok, so far. Then you could overload it to also accept arrays - one dimensional arrays, and here's the problem: Len should also work for two dimensional arrays (which is not the same variable data type), so you'd need to overload it a second time, for three dim arrays you'd need to overload the third time, for four dims the fourth, for five the fifth and so on...<br>Actually it is impossible to implement Len as function, even in Max2, which would support function overloading, so you decided right when implementing it as operator into the language, since you decided not to do the impossible. And this is the reason why I'd like to see Len as operator: everything else is impossible or would need too much work for too poor results.<br><br>I think if you permanently want to implement Len as function, you'd have to work a lot and would be still not contented with what you have done.<br><br>BlitzMax is great as it is. I can't imagine saying I don't like BMX just because Len is an operator, I don't have any problems with that. I don't say it's great that Len is an operator, but I can't complain about that, since I can't imagine how it would be possible that Len is a function.<br><br>Therefore I'm also not that interested in changing Len's behaviour when operating on user defined types.
