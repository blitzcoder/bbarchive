I took out the while/wend and all the Print commands and timed just the Flip portion of the code: with 10,000 triangles, it varies from as low as 79ms to as high as 450ish, mostly staying in the 400 area, but often slipping into the 150s.

The larger the image, the more time it takes. So you should try to use textures of the same size as real 2D images would be (64x64, 128x128 in max) if you use them on sprites and not just as a single background image<br><br>2.

Same goes for setscale etc. The less changes you have, the better the performance.<br><br><br>As a side note: If possible use OpenGL or the user created DX9 driver.
