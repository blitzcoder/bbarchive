This remainder is effectively a measure of just how much more time is required before another whole physics step can be taken. For example, a remainder of dt/2 means that we are currently halfway between the current physics step and the next one.

You can find his posts about this (and the people helping ) going back years.  I myself have used  Mark's B3D tweening code in B3D and a homemade method of tweening for max since it came out.  but Max really does seem to make it harder (than B3D) to keep perfectly smooth code.  But Grey's anti-jitter demos look real good for helping that.... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Every BMax game that's been made has a timing solution.  So a LOT of people are doing it right imo.  To give credit to just one individual is a bit arrogant.  Because it all started somewhere in the past and all this latest timing code was built off someone else's code.  They're all just revisions of what the coding pioneers did years ago when we were just toddlers. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I don't even own his software yet I don't think you are giving him the credit he deserves...

Or, if you have a 'minimum system requirement' for your game, write for that common denominator so that there is no need for 'slow system' fixes. The downside to this is that if a user has a kickbutt system, he will not see any added benefit. But so what? If your minimum system is, say, 1.5Ghz with a 64Mb video card and 512Mb of ram then you can certainly program a 3.58Mhz Super Nintendo-level game for that... :)<br><br>If Windows can't provide the required performance, then shame on Windows...<br><br>Russell <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
