I wanted to be able to do several things at once, especially as I am working on a dynamic multimedia environment where I need many things to be happening in parallel. I envisioned being able to create an OpenGL-based or in-game GUI where long-term tasks can be running concurrently, but that's somewhat tricky with a single linear execution flow.<br><br>The solution I started working on, and for additional reasons, was to implement a script language and a script execution engine. In order to provide a multitasking capability I built my own scheduler which switches execution to other scripts based on timeslices, priorities, timed events and frame flips, etc. And it works well.<br><br>Just as I finished getting this to work, and noticing how much CPU time is being unused on the other cores of multicore cpu's or multiprocessor systems, you came out with your thread module. I converted my system to implement a thread pool, so as to minimize thread allocation/deallocation. Each thread now runs its own script scheduler and executes script instructions.<br><br>This is now operational (that sounds like I just announced the full operability of the death star ;) and there is obviously a significant performance increase due to other cpu cores now becoming accessible for the execution of script commands. I have a dual core CPU but I know there are people out there with more, and there will be many more in future. I do believe this is definitely the wave of the future.<br><br>So I am VERY glad that you implemented support for real threads. While I was really happy with my own virtual solution, combined with real threads and taking advantage of extra cores is really nice. I can now create graphics/multimedia/game software that really takes advantage of the extra power. I am really interested in graphics and eventually will be doing lots of image processing and graphics creation which will be much faster when taking advantage of the available cores.<br><br>I haven't had many issues with threads - I know it requires one to be very careful with data access and mutual exclusion and all that. The only thing I am slightly concerned about is that the new garbage collector is somewhat slower than your original system. Is it possible to put garbage collection in its own thread? I did see my app taking advantage of the extra cpu core, but while I anticipated a 2x speedup it was more like a 1.6x speedup, and wondered if that was largely due to the garbage collector. But still - it's gotta be safe n'all that. I'd rather we definitely have threads with a slowish collector than no threads at all, and really it's not that bad.<br><br>I realize I can run multiple threads on a single core, as well ,but I like the idea of a fairly constant thread-pool based more on the number of available cores than on the number of tasks I want to perform, since I am using my own scheduling system for individual tasks.<br><br>One little problem I had with threads is that I wanted to be able to have a `running within this thread` context within which I could define Globals which are only Global within the thread, so that for example when a thread call some functions those functions can access global values which are defined outside the functions, but `inside` the thread, not shared with other threads. As it stands this is impossible and I am forced to pass a variable in to every function called in the thread. If you would create a new context definition for `thread-local-globals` that would be awesome. The current TLS system is cool but a) it is much too much overhead to call a function just to store and retrieve a variable, and b) you have to have a handle to the data you stored in TLS and end up having to then pass the handle into functions as a parameter, invalidating the benefits of using TLS at all when you might as well just pass the variable.<br><br>Besides this, I can see that if I wasn't doing all this jiggerypokery I would use threads to be able to load/spool files while doing other things, and to at least split off some logic/ai/graphics/physics processing in separate and possibly redistributable threads.<br><br>I think threads are a great addition to BlitzMax. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The 'standard' non-threaded build takes 1.564 seconds to complete on average.<br>Without making any changes to the code yet and just switching it to use the thread-safe garbage collector, execution time takes a <b>massive</b> nosedive and all of a sudden the same app takes 40.52 seconds to complete.

If I could cut that processing time down by about 75% on a quad core it would be a big advantage.

Each process is like a separate application with its own memory which typically is not shared with other programs/processes. A thread shares all of the memory and resources across the threads, within a process. Threads are much more `open` and let you share all your variables/memory/images/etc across all of the threads in your program, while still being able to run threads on multiple CPU cores like processes. Processes are a bit safer in the sense that they are usually confined in how much memory they can access and can't share memory with other programs/processes without some additional `door opening` message-passing commands. I personally prefer that all my doors start out being open and then have the option to close them later, rather than that they all start out shut and have to force them open. Threads are more efficient and require fewer `state changes` in order to multitask the threads. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
