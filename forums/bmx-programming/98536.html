In a way, it's good to know that many of the external libraries are not there yet because that means that BRL/Mark are/is doing a re-write on those rather than just a tweak/recompile (which probably would be more trouble than it's worth anyway...).<br><br>MonkeyMax could come in handy! Does it convert the other direction, too or do we have to wait for MaxMonkey? ;) (For me, the latter would be more useful).<br><br>Anyway, thanks for the quick reply!<br>Russell<br><br>p.s. If I remember correctly, Monkey was originally called BlitzMax 2, and BMax updates (other than bug fixes) have slowed down considerably. I honestly have no problem whatsoever with buying Monkey if BlitzMax is nearing the end of its life cycle (Hey, we can't expect Bmax to get continuous new features and free updates forever. Mark is trying to make a living here!), but it would be nice to hear what's on Mark's agenda for BMax.<br><br>I like the changes/additions Monkey has added to the language and so look forward to seeing some of the features that Bmax is currently lacking (like a professional IDE on par with Visual Basic [or even PureBasic for that matter!] with truly helpful context-sensitive help and other features people have been asking for over the years - which I won't name here :)).<br><br>Anyway, here's to the (hopefully) bright future of Monkey! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Have a look at the (free and open source) Lazarus programming environment for free pascal to see what is possible. Just a thought: I wonder if Lazarus' IDE could be adapted for use with BMax and included with the distribution and so on? By the way, it seems that BlIDE is the only IDE that is still actively developed anymore :(<br><br>@therevills: I agree that Bmax is quite stable, but I'd like to see some features added that have been requested over the years (to the language and to the IDE, etc) such as macros, enumeration, adding an executable icon from within the IDE and more.<br><br>Anyway, I'll probably wait for monkey to mature a bit more and just continue with Bmax for now.<br><br>Take care,<br>Russell <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
