The game runs, music plays and they can actually click various buttons, but -none- of the graphics actually draw.<br><br>I'm using textures up to 1024x768, but even the smaller ones (such as for the cursor) are failing.  One user reported the following setup:<br><br>Windows 2000 SP 4<br>1 GB RAM<br>3.2 GHz Intel processor<br>GeForce 6800 GT video card, might not have latest driver currently. I’ll go see if there’s a newer driver soon.<br><br>I understand that this isn't much to go on; I'll try to cob together a snippet of code if I can, but I don't really have access to these machines to test (and the full codebase is about 18.5K lines.)  Default configuration is to run using DirectX, fullscreen 1024x768 (degrading gracefully to 800x600 and 640x480, if need be.)  This happens in both fullscreen and windowed modes.<br><br>Does anybody recognize this behavior?  Does anybody have recommendations on where I should be looking? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The system I've found is single monitor, but could be suffering from dodgy drivers (as could, frankly, the other systems.)  Like I said, this happens in windowed mode as well as in fullscreen, which makes me doubt that it's a monitor-can't-handle-the-resolution issue, and users can manually override the auto-detect by editing the prefs file by hand.<br><br>After septuple-checking, I've determined that I am, in fact, calling Flip().  *grin*<br><br>I'm beginning to suspect that it could be a "OS has been upgraded, but drivers haven't" kind of situation (I vaguely remember something similar happening when I was trying to run WC3 for the first time.)  Which sucks for me, since driver upgrades of this nature aren't always straightforward and often result in ID-10/t errors... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
