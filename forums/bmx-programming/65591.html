Basicly there are two models you can persue:<br><br>The Server-Client model: This means you have one server that everyones Client "game" connects to. All information is sent to the server, the server "plays" the game, depending on the information it got, and then sends results back to all the clients. Depending on how much of the game logic you want to expose to the clients, you can have either a thick client (which has most of the game logic) or a thin client (which has almost none).<br><br>The Peer-peer model: This means that everyone serves as both a client and a server. It increases the amount of information that needs to be sent across wires, but it doesn't requires any one person to host a server, and thus is much more robust (and complicated to implement) solution than the Server-Client model.<br><br>But this question isn't one that can easilly be explained in a fora such as this. Instead I would recommend getting hold of a good book or two, and pursueing your answers there. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If the game players would have to submit the game info itself in realtime through a webserver, it would be way to unreliable and slowfor the vast majority of the games -- you'd want one of the clients to play the server.<br><br>As far as finding game players on the internet: you really can't automatically discover them -- to do that you would need to scan the entire internet, which is:<br>a) ridiculously time consuming<br>b) a HUGE no-no, since people don't exactly appreciate getting portscanned<br>c) not a good approach<br><br>You -can-, however, have the game automatically submit a client presense to a webhost which can then be queried on where to find the other players... Or you could simply allow people to specify a hostname/IP address of whoever is hosting the game, so people can connect to other people they know and have a date/time for a game scheduled with. the first approach (having a website gather &amp; keep track of the players that want to play a game) is probably the most user friendly and allows large groups of players to easily find one another... That's pretty much how something like BattleNet works, where you have a 'lobby' where people can meet, and start/join games in progress. but sometimes it's nice to have an option to just have a direct peer-to-peer game with another person if you already know their IP and don't need a match-making server. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
