Some of them will add up to the total given (the number is 12 in this example) and others will not. You must whack away any of the numbers that don't belong there (Numbers 1 &amp; 2 in this case) :o)<br><br>If anyone could please help me figure out how to code something like this, I would be ever so grateful. Some example code would very much appreciated too if possible :o)<br><br>Thanks guys. Take care! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I will give you some simple commands you should know how to use before you start:.<br>graphics()        'obiously<br>loadimage()<br>loadimagefont()/setimagefont()<br>drawimage()<br>showmouse()/hidemouse()<br>mousex()/mousey()<br>rand()<br>drawtext()<br>keydown()/keyhit()<br>while/wend, repeat/until<br><br>more basic programming<br>(arrays of images) 'not necessary but is one of the more obious alternatives<br>math to determine if mouse is within range of specific tiled image.<br><br>I will give you a rundown of what you need to do:<br><br>first you need to set your graphics mode <br>load all images. looks like you are going to need a graphic image for each of the numbers. if you want to use text fonts for the answers then you are going to need to load different size fonts. If you use images for the answers,  I don't recommend(uses a lot of Ram) but is your option.<br><br>figure out how to and what order your numbers are going to be displayed and do it.<br>loop:<br>once your screen is set check for user mouse input. determine if mouse is within range of number with mousex &amp; mousey. and determine if mouse button was pressed with mousehit.  compare values selected with correct answer. display output based on answer.<br>loop end<br><br>note:<br>try having two images for each number one non-hilited and one hilited for when a number is selecter. display acordingly and keep track of numbers selected.<br><br>I am sorry if you know more than I am assuming but being this such a simple game I am assuming you are really green :-). <br>I am definitely not a game expert and my explanation may not be the best. I have made a couple of games and that is the way I would have made it if I was starting out.<br> <br>don't give up. just about everyone is willing to help if you just ask specific questions and if you show some effort.<br>I can help you directly, when I can if you email me with sample code. I have time randomly during the week so it might take me up to two to three days to answer you so if you are willing I am there. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

With respect, I am most certainly not green when it comes to programming :o) I know all of the basic programming such as setting up graphics, detecting the mouse position etc etc. the thing that is troubling me is me is the actual calculating of a random sum. For example I would just like to know how to do the following:<br><br>1. CPU generates a random total, for example the number 18.<br><br>2. CPU then generates some random numbers such as 9, 5, 4, 9 &amp; 2.  Some of the numbers will add up and others will not. Obviously the correct numbers to keep here would be 9 &amp; 9. You would whack away the numbers 5, 4 &amp; 2 to finish the task.<br><br>3. Repeat step 1<br><br>Thank you for your co-operation Jesse, it is very much appreciated :o) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
