Start at that. The authors had a reason to take the time and get all the hassle away from implementing it (see Blitz3D, Xors3D, Leadwerks).<br><br>Next, don't worry if it supports only Windows - it's still <a href="http://marketshare.hitslink.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx?qprid=8" target="_blank">90% of the market share</a>, so a lot of computers can still run your game. However, it'll probably be harder to advertise it to publishers (because they always want the broadest range possible, and that is achievable with cross-platforming). <br>Sometimes the "cross-platform is better" propaganda might force you to miss out on a good windows-only engine that you'd be happy to be working with. Don't allow that to happen.<br><br>To use MiniB3D yes you need MinGW installed, and yes it'll be a pain to put everything in the right place, <a href="/posts.php?topic=90964" target="_blank">but it's doable</a> (it was a pain for me and I managed to do it - glad I did, miniB3D is very interesting). <br>All .C based modules will need MinGW, so you might as well install it anyway. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Almost all modules install similarly to MiniB3D, and many if not most NEED to be compiled. And the ones that don't might need to be re-compiled in the future to handle some other changes...<br><br>Check the beginner forums for instructions on installing modules, or ask for help in the module's forum if you can't get it working. Generally speaking it's as easy as dragging a folder into the Mods folder in your BMax directory. Getting minGW installed however will take the help of a tutorial (again check the forums, there's some stickys for this).<br><br>Personally I can't recommend MiniB3D enough. It's what I started on and what I still prefer due to the cross platform factor. Kryzon is right, windows is still almost 90% of the market of home PC's however a vast swath of windows systems are used in work environments which will never know the pleasures of gaming. Don't discount the mac (or even linux these days) segments of the market as being to small to matter. However my real draw wish MiniB3D is it's spin off iMiniB3D. With proper planning (and the right skills) it becomes quite trivial to translate a MiniB3D project to iOS, and that's a BIG deal since iOS is so easy to monetize compared with PC platforms. Additionally I've been working on an Android port of MiniB3D which is coming along nicely. So with 1 engine you can hit the top 4-5 platforms, and it doesn't cost a dime to get started, you just need a few skills that you will need to pick up eventually anyway.<br><br>All of this is not to disparage the commercial or other free alternatives, Everything has it's pluses and minuses and the biggest one is usually comfort level of the individual user. This is just my preference.<br><br>Just my 2c. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
