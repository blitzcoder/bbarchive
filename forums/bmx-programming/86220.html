I assume this is the max diameter of any of the points... then you toggle the grid on and off.... so isnt that the smallest possible grid size and therefore, I should get an 11x speed up...<br><br>hmm I guess we are not seeing eye to eye or at least our cpu's arent <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Ill go test it out again. <br></div>The tutorial pack doesn't contain a stress test. Tutorial 15 is a tutorial on how to use grid occlusion. Each box has five masses and eight constraints. It uses a grid size of 40, the maximum is 128, and it also has the iterations set to two, so it's not suprising it only gets to 240 boxes(1200 masses). Like I said it's not a stress test.<div class="quote"> x11? shouldnt that put me over 11,000 if it can handle about 1,000 without a grid <br></div>No, not even close. You are assuming that the time increase for adding masses is a constant gradient, but it is not. The increase is in fact a steep curve with the time increase itself increasing with each mass added. My x11 figure comes from running a stress test with 3000 masses which had a ~16ms(60fps) update time. Switching the grid occlusion off increased the update time to ~180ms. I calculate that as an x11 speed increase. Conversely starting without grid occlusion I get 900 masses at ~16ms update time, then switching the grid on gives an update time of ~3ms. That's a speed increase of about x5. Do you see how the speed increase for grid occlusion is dependent on the amount of masses within the the simulation and not the other way around?<br><br>Feel free to check out my stress test on your own rig. I'd be interested to see the results. <a href="http://www.gooeyblob.com/files/test.exe" target="_blank">Physlite stress test</a> [345KB] <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
