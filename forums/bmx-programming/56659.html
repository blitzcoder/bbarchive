Then we developed Factor2, which was a great project. At Factor2 I was working as the Lead Graphical Designer but this time I will focus more both on the programming part and the visuals. Samuel will also work as a concept and textureartist. We work very tight with great and lots of communication over the net. <br><br><br>Contacts:<br>Andreas Jirenius<br>ajirenius@...<br><br><br>Additional Info:<br>I choose to add the first pages of our design document for you to get a hinch of what we are talking about here. <br><br><b>ARCHON 2160</b><br><br><b>INTRODUCTION</b><br>*removed*<br><br><b>HISTORY</b><br>In 1983, EA released Archon, a game developed by Free Fall Associates.<br>It immediatly became smash hit on the current platforms and the success was undoubtly about gameplay.<br>With mediocre graphics it succeeded to combine the tactics of a chesslike boardgame and headsup action where 2 players must meet up in fastpaced shooting and killing. The game got several followups and also fan-versions that was played wide even though it was not official releases. <br>Basicly the goal of the game was to either destroy the enemy completely, or control all 4 hot spots. These spots were good because they gave the defending player an advantage during battle. And what also contributed to the fantastic gameplay was that for skilled players, any piece on the board could defeat any other one. That meaning, the orc or knight (the pawns) could defeat the wizard or sorceress (the king) if played correctly. Difficult - but possible.<br>The development team of ARCHON 2160 must not have experience of playing this game as what we are trying to create will have lots and lots of new and changed elements but still I would like just to introduce the game where we did draw our first inspiration from. If we can create the same great gameplay that that game did have we have very much succeeded.<br><img src="http://img475.imageshack.us/img475/2658/archon011nj.th.gif"><br><br><b>OVERALL GAMEIDEA</b><br>Now that we have given the history about where our inspiration is drawn its time to look at what we are aiming towards.<br>In the end, this game will be a 2-player game available (and preferable played) over internet or LAN. It can be played on one computer but in a special gamemode discussed later on. The players will choose side (good &amp; evil ) and then place their units on the square and checkered board. They will be placed on the two first rows closest to the player (just as a chess game). The positions of the units will have crucial and tactical elements. Now when the game starts you are not able to see what kind of unit your enemy has placed on a specific square as it is hidden for you but you can see your own units clearly. Now in turns you move the units on the board. They have different moveabilities but you can choose not to use up all steps of a unit (for tacical purposes not to reveal what kind of unit you are moving). Whenever two units wind up on the same square the units are revealed for both players and a battle will take place (using the arena that the square is representing).<br>The 2 units are placed on seperate corners and now a fastpaced actiongame is deciding who will win the square. All units will have different types of weapons, special abilities, speed, moving functions, energy, shield and so on so it ALL units will be strong against certain units but weak against others. Also mastering several different units and gameplays will give you a huge advantage on the battlefield. Also some arenas are great for some units but a total disaster for others.<br>After one units energy reaches zero it is destroyed and the other will now come back to the square and be concealed for the opponent once again. Still the units energy will stay the same as it was when it left the arena (in other words damaged units will stay damaged). <br>The whole game ends if a player manages to destroy all enemy units on the board OR if he/she succeeds in taking and defending (keeping one unit on) the 4 important hotspots on the board. When the winner is crowned it will be registered at a central ranking server giving statistics over earlier games played. The rankingserver will also act as a lobby where people can find each other for a game and check whos the hottest player out there. <br><br><img src="http://img530.imageshack.us/img530/5595/pawnhalfwiresmall6ei.jpg"><br><br><b>TECHNICAL DATA[b]<br>Platform: Windows<br>Graphics Engine: Irrlicht Engine<br>Programming language: BlitzMax<br>3Dformats: 3ds, bsp<br>2Dformats: bmp, jpg<br><br> <br>[b]GRAPHICS - OVERVIEW</b><br>The visuals needed for the game are not really overwhelming as this is a mediumsized game. Most work will be focused on the actual units, the arenas and the special effects but of course there are a lot more that needs to be done to make a topnotch and enjoyable game. Both in Boardview and Battleview the camera will be placed over the arena about 55° above ground. This should be taken in consideration when putting details on units. The camera will also zoom in some when units are closer to each other. <br><br>Camera – Battlescene<br>The camera will be placed about 50° – 60° above ground in a rather zoomed out distance (fig1). It will be zoomed in if the units come close to each other but most of the time almost all arena will be visible. It will somehow try to keep aim at the mediumpoint between the units. <br><img src="http://img212.imageshack.us/img212/5382/cameraperspective8kl.jpg"><br>fig1<br><br>Conceptart<br><br>The conceptart are very important in the initial stage of visual design as it will provide the correct atmosphere and feeling of the game. It is especially important that these can be used by the 3D modellers when designing the units and the arenas. When drawing the units you can of course draw the unit in action but to be in good use for the modellers we also need the unit in at least 2 different 2d perspectives (eg Front and Left Side)<br><br>UNITS: 12 individual models (6 for each side)<br>ARENAS: 4 different arena themes<br><br>3D-modelling and texturing<br>We will use the *.3ds format but if needed we can discuss this.<br>Arenas will be using the Quake3 format *.bsp or a plain *.3ds format whatever suits the modeller.<br><br>UNITS: 12 individual models (6 for each side)<br>ARENAS: 4 different arenas + placeable 3d-objects (walls, electric fields, etc)<br>BOARDSCENE: Scene with a checkered board.<br><br><br>2D-art<br>All 2D-art must be delivered in *.bmp format (unless told otherwise) and will later on be converted if needed.<br>Textures for all models<br>Gametitle (must be published in several formats, sizes and themes)<br>Titlescreen<br>HUD: Energybar, Frame<br>FX-art: Particlemaps, Explosions, Fire, Glows.<br>Different cursors and sights.<br><br><br><b>UNITS</b><br><br>The units will all have some common features but also have their own individual features that will make all battles and gameplay interesting for a long time. Both sides (Good and Evil) consists of 6 different units but at start on the board there will be 16 units (pretty much like a set of Chess). This list will be developed and altered as the production proceeds.<br><br>CHIMERA<br><br>	Speed: 		Slow<br>	Armour: 	Heavy<br>	Steeringtype: 	Ground, 8-ways, Rotating cannontower<br>			Cannontower will hold its positions regardless to the other steering<br>			It will be manouvered with either the mouse or secondary steeringkeys.<br>	Weapon: 	Flamethrower<br>			Will have a wide cone of fire. Must be “reloaded” after a fuelbar drops.<br>W.Range: 	Short/Medium<br>W.

Damaging everything around the unit.<br>	W.Range:	Small<br>	W.Damage:	Medium<br>	Boardmove:	3 steps<br>Special:	The Banshee is totally cloaked and cannot be seen by the enemy. Only if bumping into walls or when sending an EMP-wave the Banshee is visible. Still you can hear the sound of it when moving.<br><br>DJINNI<br><br>Speed: 		Special<br>	Armour: 	Medium<br>	Steeringtype: 	Teleporting<br>The unit cannot move on its own but can teleport wherever the player places the beaconcursor. It’s of course vulnerable when staying still as you move the beacon to where it will teleport but it does give the opportunity to move through walls and also move behind enemy fast. <br>	Weapon:	Electric wave<br>Sends an electric wave surrounding the Unit. Damaging everything around the unit.<br>	W.Range:	Small<br>	W.Damage:	Medium<br>	Boardmove:	2 steps<br><br><br>VALKYRIA<br><br>Speed: 		Fast<br>	Armour: 	Light<br>	Steeringtype: 	Flying, Rotate/Accelerate/Break, Rotating cannons. <br>	Weapon:	Minigun<br>The crosshair is moved along with the ship but not rotated if ship is steering. Aiming can be done with mouse or alt. steering keys. Fires in longer bursts. Bullet now shown but only impact on ground and walls.<br>	W.Range:	Medium<br>	W.Damage:	Medium<br>	Boardmove:	3 steps<br><br><br>GOLEM<br><br>Speed: 		Slow<br>	Armour: 	Heavy<br>	Steeringtype: 	8-way <br>	Weapon:	Missiles<br>Big fat missiles that do explode on impact (be it a wall or enemy). Explosion does damage in a short range. Missiles does have some homing ability (not much though). Reload time is pretty long. <br>	W.Range:	Long<br>	W.Damage:	Great (on direct impact), Less on explosion area<br>	Boardmove:	1 step<br><br>*units removed*<br><br>*text removed* <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
