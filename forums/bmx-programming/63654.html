You're ship will *always* be drawn at 512,384. When you scale up all of your other rectangles will move according to the origin (which I assume is in the top left). What you need to do is to scale everything relative to the ship, not the 0,0 origin.<br><br>I'll try to explain it here and show an example <br><br>1) You need to find the distance from your ship to the real origin (0,0). Which in this case would be easy: you're ship's x,y. Let us call this vector S.<br><br>2) You can express all the other rectangles' positions in relation to your ship's position. So for instance, if my ship is at 300,300 and a rectangle at 100,100. The rectangle's relative position to my ship is -200,-200. Let's call this rectangle's absolute position (100,100) vector R.<br><br>3) To zoom in and out with the ship being the central focus I have to transform all of the objects' positions I want to zoom to the ship's coordinate space. This is achieved by taking the vector (R - S) and then scaling THAT result, call it A. Now take A and add S back to it.<br><br>Some example code<br>(note: this hasn't been tested because I am not on a computer with blitzmax installed)<br><br><pre class=code>

</pre><br><br>thats a pice tonyg posted<br><br>i can see here he applies the zoom to the size of the rect.<br><br>DrawRect ScreenX-(3*ViewZoom), ScreenY-(3*ViewZoom),(6*ViewZoom),(6*ViewZoom)<br><br>but in your example Alex, you didn't do that. Yet, when you "zoom" in with your example, the rects get bigger and smaller, and the only variable you modified was there X and Y positions. modifying where they are, should make them only move about the screen, not appear to become bigger or smaller.<br><br>weird. can't figure that part out.<br><br>For me with my images, I apply the *newscale, to the setscale of my drawn target ships. because merely applying to the X and Y draw coords moves them ABOUT the screen like what I am saying your code "SHOULD" do and doesn't make them bigger or smaller. So basically now as I use the mouse wheel and zoom out, the ship becomes "smaller" by changing the scale, and the x and y coords are modified moving it closer to my ship. so that the change in size is offset by the movement closer to my ship, so that it is still the same distance away from my ship before I changed the level of zoom.<br><br>or vice versa, so that the movement closer to my ship is offset by the drop in size.<br><br>will this work for multiplayer? its supposed to be amultiplayer game. when I "zoom" now I am merely changing the "drawing" coords and not where the enemy ship has actually moved to, so what I mean to say is, if I am zooming, I won't be invariably moving his ship closer to my in actual fact will I? only the graphical part... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

</pre><br><br>i have to apply that to all the x and y coords of whatever I draw. not soo bad.<br>However what that does, is change the x and y coords of these ships, planets, etc, when I zoom, and when I am moving the player ship, these objects x and y coords change accordingly. <br><br>This is not seen on screen, because they are being drawn in relation to the player ship, while i can still fly "past" them and they are not attached to me like a glue, i am wondering, if this poses a problem, for multiplayer... and if the positioning is still true? and is it that the coords dont matter once I apply the offset, and things move relatively how they should. ? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

</pre><br><br>again, your entity.x/y are your world coordinates and do not relate to anything (well almost...i'll get to that in a bit) with drawing. that single variable 'x' must be calculated before each draw command based on two parameters: the ship's x and the torpedo.x.<br><br>Now, with the collision...I've never used ImageCollide() but from the looks of it; it looks like it takes into account the screen (drawing) coordinates and scale/rotation to produce the correct response. So you have to give the function your drawing cooridnates and not your world coordinates.<br><br>i.e.:<br><pre class=code>
tx# = ((torpedo.x - ship.x) * newscale) + ship.x
ty# = ((torpedo.y - ship.y) * newscale) + ship.y

ex# = ((enemyship.x - ship.x) * newscale) + ship.x
ey# = ((enemyship.y - ship.y) * newscale) + ship.y

</pre><br><br>Since I don't know completely what you are trying to do all I can offer is bits of examples in hopes that it is in the right direction. With that said, funny that you posted when you did as I'm in the middle of writing a series of tutorials on this very subject (2D camera movements/zooming/rotation) so that's why its somewhat fresh in my mind. You can keep an eye on the blitzmax tutorials forum as I'll be posting them there in the coming weeks. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
