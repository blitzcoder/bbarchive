Mine is still working. <br></div><br>Yes, it works, for now. But OSes continue to change, and unless someone is going to guarantee me that BlitzMax will continue to work with every new version of Win/MacOS/Linux, then I can't depend on it. This is not my "hobby"; this is my <b>job</b> (my company) and I need to use a product that I know is 100% supported by it's developer.<br><br>It's also not just a support issue, but also I need to know that the language will grow to support new technologies. A good example is the whole "64-bit" debate. I <i>know</i> we don't need 64-bit support now, but at some point 32-bit apps <u>will</u> <u>be</u> as archaic as 16-bit apps are now. This is a matter of future-proofing the language.<br><br><div class="quote"> re: switching to Unity3D: If you use unity I think it is for the 3d support and mobile targets. Otherwise I can't see any other reason. <br></div><br>Those are two very good reasons, aren't they? I was here at the start when BlitzMax was launched, and I looked forward to the 3D module that was never fully realized. Secondly, just like I mentioned above, BlitzMax needs to grow, to evolve, to be thought of as a relevant, modern language. I'd love to see support for iOS and Android platforms.<br><br><div class="quote"> Have you seen what Brucey is working on recently, Tachyon? <br></div><br>Absolutely! Brucey is the best thing that could have happened to BliztMax. His continued dedication to it is awesome. I only wish Mark would hand the reins over to him and let him work on BlitzMax 2.<br><br><div class="quote"> I like lists :-) <br></div> <br>Me too. My dream for BlitzMax 2.0 would be:<br><br>- Target platforms of Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS and Android. I don't care about browser targets like HTML5 and Flash, nor am I concerned with video game consoles. These five OSs that I listed are driving every major computing platform today. They should be supported with BlitzMax.<br><br>- I'd like to see BlitzMax 2.0 "adopt" an open source 3D engine (such as Ogre3D) and fully implement it through native syntax and complete documentation. Yes, I know there have been numerous attempts by the community to do this, but it needs to be done at the developer level so that the module/wrapper stays up-to-date unlike every other community project. Better yet, let's get Josh on-board and give us back native BlitzMax access to his Leadwerks Engine and editor.<br><br>- Same as the 3D engine, we need a more robust open source audio system integrated into BlitzMax 2.0. My #1 customer support issue is missing/faulty sound on Linux. Plus, I'd love native command access to 3D audio and reverb effects. Yep, I know all about the community wrappers (FMOD) but I need this to be supported by the developer. Community projects always grow cold when the person who starts it is tired of supporting it.<br><br>- How about a dependable way to play back video? I've asked for this for 7 years.<br><br>- 64-bit support.<br><br>- Better multi-thread support (including better documentation and examples). I know BlitzMax has this now, but I think for many of us it would be helpful to understand how we can make multithreaded processes work for us. Sometimes just supporting a technology is not enough- we need examples, real-world situations, and gratuitous documentation to get the most out of it.<br><br>- Better support for publishing! Let's start by getting easier icon support. Then native support for Steam achievements. Let's not forget in-app purchases and easy integration with popular payment systems. How about exporter options for Apple's App Store (and iOS/Android stores, if these platforms are supported). It took me a week to figure out how to get my BlitzMax app ready for Apple's App store- I would pay a lot of money right now to have an IDE that could automate this process for me. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

JoshK is doing it as a job, and so for "money". I assume both things wont go together very well.

Perhaps not so much in the showy-graphics part of the game, but more in the stuff that holds it all together.<br><br>@Linux Audio<br>There are lots of audio modules to choose from which perform well on Linux. I agree that as it currently stands, there are issues with FreeAudio on Linux, but I'd like to think we (as a community, or just Skid himself :-p ) can improve that situation. I did some work removing compile-time dependencies from it - allowing it to dynamically load a given "driver" at runtime, but I didn't look into it much more than that. The next step would be to have a way to determine which one to use automagically, or even add an option as part of your application (eg. Use PulseAudio). Since it is dynamic now, you wouldn't need to have specific libs installed on the system for the game to load.<br><br>@64-bit<br>Well, it's something I wouldn't mind having too.<br>I've ported most pub/brl stuff to support it, and I have apps/games running native on the three platforms. Windows still requires a lot of work, but the other two are performing very well. There are still some issues with the new bcc which need worked on to get things like MaxIDE running properly on 64-bit, although the MaxGUI examples are all running fine on OS X and Linux (using my GTK module).<br><br>@iOS and Android<br>The biggest problem I have here is with the need to port the OpenGL stuff in BlitzMax to also work with OpenGL ES 2. And here I'm the first to admit I'm really out of my depth.<br>As for building for ARM, I already have BlitzMax console programs running natively on my Raspberry Pi (which I know is neither iOS nor Android, but covers the major issue of the different architecture).<br>I haven't tried doing *anything* for those platforms as yet though, given the fact we don't have a working Graphics platform yet.<br><br><div class="quote"> My dream for BlitzMax 2.0 would be: <br></div><br>Apart from the 3D engine integration, as mentioned above, I'm generally in agreement with all your points.<br><br><br>Anyway, as we can see, the community is still reasonably interested in producing games using BlitzMax. :-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So if there is a free possibility to write the particle effects or the configuration is done in a readable format (xml) it is not that problematic (as you could write your own helpers if really needed). Sorry for claiming "TimelineFX costs money", it is only the editor which is sold.<br><br><br>@Targets<br>I do not care for Xbox, Playstation, Wii, Sega Dreamcast or SNES. I care for Android, iOS, Mac/Win/Linux. Other things are "extras". But even if iOS or X is left out because the new implementations do not work... such things happen.<br><br><br>@OpenGL ES:<br>Easiest is of course the whole replacement of the graphics engine ... but you then lose many of the modules (relaying on the graphics part). Alternatively OpenGL ES is another "driver" hooking in - so on Win DX/OGL is available, on Mac and Linux you get OGL and on other platforms it might be OGLES.<br>Maybe more experienced programmers (in the matters of OGL/OGL ES) may see chances to get things running... of course it then needs BMX-NG to compile on a platform using OpenGL ES.<br><br><br>@Sound<br>As soon as other platforms get added, the available sound architectures would have to get re-evaluated too.<br><br><br>@3d-Engine<br>We have "DrawImage", "LoadSound" etc ... so I assume people would like to have "LoadMesh", "RotateEntity" ... too. Both, sprites and meshes are not game specific things, it might be useful for scientific simulations, sketching some architecture or whatever... but yes, there is no need for an inbuild 3d engine, but it would be nice to have something as core module so users know that it will receive bugfixes/enhancements.<br>If the language gets a revival, people will write modules as they might have done it in the past ("for the fun" - or - "potential sales"). Think the same discussion could be done for native GUI-widgets (MaxGUI was sold too before it got included in BlitzMax), networking classes, ...<br>So it is up on the one who codes things whether to include something in the "basic package" or not. If nobody is willed to help/write OpenGL ES code, it just wont be available on that platforms.<br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I do not know much about consoles and the restrictions they have, even Android or iOS have restrictions regarding file access. Newer consoles will surely have more compatibility to todays PCs so it is more likely to get something working on that platforms too.<br>As BlitzMax is targeted for "indie developers" I assumed that "iOS/android" and the default "mainstream" PC OSes would be enough. Even RasPI is more a "playground" than market, same for Ouya. Of course, nice to haves, but not very effective targets for increasing your potential target group.<br><br>But as said... before even talking about other platforms, the first move will be to get multimedia features (gfx, sfx) working on ARM.

How is the idea of getting an Enterprise Licensing, where Companies, that make money using BlitzMax, get to pay a monthly fee to see their bugs fixed (faster) in the official BlitzMax Release. So BRL is interested to develop BlitzMax and support it because that's where the money comes from. A company could also demand Brucey's stuff to be in the official Release and be supported by BRL. The rest of the community can participate from the bugfixes and the companies that depend on BlitzMax are sure they can get decent support and it won't fade out like it was with Blitz3D and BlitzPlus. Paying a fee for support is fairly normal with Software. Companies won't bother. BRL can then easily think of releasing BlitzMax for free if the sales settle down like they did with Blitz3D and BlitzPlus but not declaring it Open-Source. Maybe get the once paying customers a Enterprise License for a limited time. Once someone has it and see that there is a development in this field, they maybe are entitled to get into the license fee - and if not, there is no loss because once you baught BlitzMax BRL wasn't getting any money off you anyway. If there are no sells of BlitzMax anymore, releasing it for free with the support fee, won't cost BRL anything but will attract more developpers that maybe create a game or app of any kind that will get them money and once they can get money off their product, they have a demand for good service and the money to pay for it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The Demo was unlimited time free to use so all the zillion people must've been here. I know a time, when I had my friends install the B3D Demo to play my early LAN games. We have a Beginner's corner for unexperienced users where they can ask the silly questions over and over again. Is having more people using and testing your product bad?<br><br>@degac<br><div class="quote"> a 'open-source' thing is something of anyone/all, but quite none is supporting it at the end...  <br></div><br><br>I don't quite understand what you are trying to say. Is Open-Source not supported? No. E.g. there are several smaller Linux branches that are maintained by some developpers that will happily fix a bug, you call out to them.<br><br>Patron is a nice idea to help people like artists, who you want to support by your measures to continue releasing art at a faster level than they could've without you supporting them. But I think BRL is less some kind of artist that provides us with certain pieces at a random time but more of a service company. We wanted a programming language that was as easy as BlitzBasic and compatible with Linux and Mac, object oriented and modular. We can have it for 80 Bucks. Now we've played enough with it and are getting money from it and have a demand for a service to get bugs fixes and some features added. But the longer BlitzMax is out, the less people are going to buy it as the marked saturates and a person can only hold one BlitzMax license (if they are reasonable and not paying rent to three appartments for their Single life next to each other). So bugfixing will only pay out in the beginning where the biggest bugs are found and the fix will convince new people to buy the language. In the end when there are only few people left, BRL will need to put a great amount of time in bugfixing and adding to the software to convince the few potential customers to buy it.<br><br>Just look at the companies selling Linux. Why would anyone buy Red Hat Linux if Fedora is nearly the same and free? Because Red Hat comes with support. There are people, who fix bugs certainly. Not only the ones I found and not only if some guy feels like fixing them. I pay them to fix them and if they won't, I won't continue paying them, so they are actually interested in fixing the bugs I ordered to fix. This is a certainty that companies like. They like someone they can rely on. If BRL offers an "I will fix your bugs first" kind of license, a company can use BlitzMax safely. That's what we see in Linux Ubuntu (Canonical), Red Hat/Fedora, Suse as well as in Java (Oracle) or Apache. And having free Versions of their software keeps the entrance low and that means a developper can train him/herself in this software before investing money. That's why I could easily start a job as a Java developper. I learned Java at School and University because it's free. Now the company I work for pays Oracle for keeping it secure and fixing bugs. Could've gone with BlitzMax the same way. After all, we, that we make games/apps in BlitzMax that sell, will be the head of a company that's searching for BlitzMax developpers one day if this language survives. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

A idea to get even more ppl involved so it can be "widely used". <br><br>I'd like to have a paid service that will fix bugs and widen the standard toolset of BlitzMax. Making TMap an abstract class and providing different kinds of maps for example.<br><br>I'm with Grey Alien on the patreon. Also it states "Your support will help fund the development of the Monkey2 programming language". That's not what I want and not what I think makes sense: BRL should expand Monkey and BlitzMax, not replace them with a new product. The only reason BRL does this, is that there is no other way to make money offering "lifetime support" which was like 15 years for Blitz3D. I think this is the wrong idea. <br><br>I like the idea of having BlitzMax that is still so near to hardware that it can use pointers and interface with all sorts of c code and having Monkey for maximum flexibility being as abstract as possible. Get the interfaces and generics from Monkey into BlitzMax, add a support contract for both languages and I'm happier than ever. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Everything I asked was answered from a lots of kind people here.<br><br>I have DarkBasic Pro too , but is slower than BlitzMax and you need plugins.<br>For example DarkBasic text functions are very very slow and you need plugin.<br>The DarkBasic ide is not so powerful as BLIDE. There are some IDEs but when you try to create one project with a lots of smaller source files and you will have some error , the DarkBasic Compiler doesn't inform correctly about the line of code where the error is.<br><br>For example if you have a project with 3 large files , one with 5000 lines of code , another with 13244 line of codes and another one smaller with 300 lines of code.<br>Your project will have 3 files. But if for some reason you have an error at the line 11050 in the second file , the darkbasic compiler will not inform you correctly about which line your bug is , (In fact the compiler adds all lines of code) so the line 11050 of the second file is the 16050 in whole game source code. So the compiler will inform you at the line 16050 , without directing you to this line sometimes. (There is not line 16050 because the second file is 11050 lines long).<br>So is very easy to get lost and will never be able to find your error.<br>I lost a complete projects with this problem , suddenly in one project with 100 small source code files , an error appeared  in some line which wasn't the correct one. I was forced to create one HUGE file with 50000 lines. It take ages to compile and a lots of page down and page up needed to (TRAVEL) inside your code. Unprofessional way to code. <br><br>Another worst problem I had with the older ide was when I saved my project the IDE destroyed all of my code and I lost my whole game.<br><br>If you don't have plugins you are not able to do professional game , for example the core physics of DarkBasic sucks and you need Ageia Physics plugin and now the Ageia Physics , is not supported or the drivers are very old. (There was one plugin with name Nuclear Glory) But was very buggy and now abandoned, I never used it.<br><br>The DarkBasic is nice but not for professional game making. (The only thing you can do   is , quick 3D programming) but you will not produce a professional product at the end , even with nice 3D models or nice effects. The engine is slow , whole language is slow.<br><br>There is not any GUI system in DarkBasic pro , they had one plugin with name BLUE GUI , but is abandoned now. About in game GUI , there is not any at all.<br><br>DarkBasic have a lots - lots of Plugins , but you are ending to have pay more than $1000 for plugins , you can create some game , but not professional and fast.<br><br>The FPS Creator (The old one, the Classic) was nice but very limited and enough to create an amateur game. (You wasn't able to manipulate whole engine , they had the fpscript , which was very complex and not programmable) You can do some scripts but the whole FPS Creator was just First Person Shooter maker , you wasn't able to create other more complex game , like rpg , or adventure , or other platform game. All created the same boring pick up a random weapon , create a quick level with ready made content which all already have them and shoot everything that moves. Those are not games. <br>All create shooter games , whole world have shooter games , I have fed up with shooter games.<br>You wasn't able to do more complex things with FPS Creator , there wasn't any inventory system and the fpscript was very limited , you wasn't able to make any change in the whole game look. All rooms was square and the menus the same , the only thing you could , was able to change few menu images and wasn't very difficult to create new content , you was forced to purchase the FPSC model packs , the only model formats which was more supported was the .x model and .dbo which in each darkbasic pro update was broken. There wasn't any terrain creation system.<br><br>The FPS Creator reloaded (Game GURU now) is under development , I was a gold pledge but is very complex and incomplete and many years will pass until they will finish it. They publish 3D models and they do not progressing in the core of the application.<br><br>I think , DarkBasic can't port game in other platform , only in Windows.<br>The game creators have the AGK for this but is a different product.<br><br>About BlitzMax , have the biggest advantage the IDE (BLide is the BEST) even the native IDE is much better than DarkBasic Pro.<br><br>The Blitzmax is much faster , it compile the code to flat assembler and is more object oriented and have methods and other things that darkbasic not exist.<br><br>BlitzMax have MaxGUI and at least IfsoGUI for in game GUI ,(DarkBasic have not any  game GUI at all)  (Yes both are abandoned) but is better than nothing.<br><br>Both communities (BlitzMax and DarkBasic) was very helpful , but the DarkBasic forums have one problem , your post will automatically be locked if you are not speak for a short period of time and if you want to discus about some topic or problem you had , you are not able to reopen it or post in the same topic.<br><br>The forum of BlitzMax is much better in this.<br> <br>In Blitzmax there are other disadvantages , there are fewer plugins , but they work faster.<br>I believe all programming languages have their advantages and disadvantages.<br>About 3D , The BlitzMax , have disadvantage here , I haven't used MiniB3D yet , because the project I am working is not 3D.<br><br>The conclusion is , I use BlitzMax for game programming a lot. (For professional game programming). I discovered this language much later than DarkBasic Pro.<br><br>I believe the most important is the community , people have finished a lots of things than the companies wasn't able to implement. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
