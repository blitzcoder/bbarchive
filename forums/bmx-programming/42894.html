Not so easy to keep track of what's going on but that's not the only point.<br><br>I am guessing that Goto is disabled in Strict mode because of something along the lines of the compiler needing to go through the sourcecode in a single forward direction and dip into any function definitions and such as a hierarchy.<br><br>Also the very idea of Strict is that things need to be defined before they are used, ie Functions or variables need to be defined higher up in the code before they can be used (which I think actually is a limitation). So that very rule enforces a paradigm of making sure everything is in `order`. .... so you can't really then go using Goto which totally denies any kind of order - the compiler wouldn't be able to deal with that if it needs things to be in sequence. And probably it would be a lot more work to get the compiler working with allowing a strict mode that lets you jump around, which is a contradiction in terms anyway.<br><br>That's my take on it.<br><br>Personally I'm not using strict mode and I like it. I like that I don't HAVE to put definitions higher up in the code, and I don't therefore HAVE to write such structured programs. It makes things harder to write and forces you to have to make difficult decisions about what is defined where, which is just one more headache for me. I like that I can refer to variables and functions that are further down in the code beyond where they are called. It's natural.<br>To me, "Strict" is added for backwards compatibility with the old way of doing it, while non-strict is actually an improvement.<br><br>And you can never have enough Goto's ;-) Pity there is no Gosub though. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You might be able to pull off some weird crap in English and still be understood, but nobody is going to like you for it, and the fact you can doesn't mean that you should.<br><br>The style you use really has plenty to do with the language.  Ask anyone that has used a more rigid language than C or Basic.  Dropping the goto statement helps avoid any confusion over where and at what state a loop has terminated.  Heavily nested loops are likely to use the stack, because the x86 doesn't have that many registers.<br><br>It's a throwback to assembly language of old, and doesn't fit as well with the way compilers are optimised to work now.  Goto relates directly to a jump instruction, and a jump instruction, unlike a call, doesn't store and clear the stack.  I'm not sure what exact implications would come of this, but if you didn't write your compiler to expect potentially extra stuff pulled or pushed on to the stack, once you try to pull off it, you could have a mess to deal with.  <br><br>Of the two virtual machines and lexers/compilers I've written, neither of them included a goto like function, simply because of the potential headaches involved.

Stick the usual mess that people put in for loops in there.  That's why you'd want to be more explicit about what type of loop you're exiting at least (cos remember we have more than just for loops), and more so setting the variable to the max value will make that much clearer to you or whoever looks at your code later.  It also fits quite well with While type loops.  <br><br>You do raise a fair criticism of that method however, but it depends on the style you use :P  The difference with Exit is it would kick you out straight away, whereas if you set the variable you'll still execute whatever is left in that loop before the Next.<br><br>You would have to customise your code to suit, and arguably this method is pretty ugly as well, as there could be a long list of variables to set, and again maintenance work to do should something change.  Bear in mind though that you'd be dealing with the exact same situation if you elected to use a while/wend loop instead.<br><br>Exit is definately preferable to goto-ing out of a loop, which is ugly and hacky as hell in my point of view.  If you must have a nested Exit, please somehow make it "Exit [loop type]" at least.<br><br>Oh, and the challenge is working within the constraints.  You only have x many commands available to use to represent algorithm y.  If this was meant to be easy you'd just magically have algorithm y already.  Stupid example: If your language doesn't come with a command to input a whole string at once, only single characters, you write a function to stick the single characters together into a whole string.  That's what programming is about, working within the language constraints, such as lack of a particular function, to get it to do what you want.<br><br>That's what essentially Warren has done, there's no Exit command for nested Fors so he's been using Goto.

How simple is that?<br><br>You'll always be using the stack.  If you're using nested loops moreso.  The x86 Loop instruction for example ONLY uses the cx register (well it used to, dunno if that's changed) as a counter, therefore any nesting you do would have to move from other registers or pull off the stack.  There are of course other ways to write loops but I'm sure you'd be using the stack at some point for these also.  <br><br>The potential is you exit out of the loop with a jump and still have crap on the stack that your program isn't necessarily expecting to be there.  Perhaps your jump even skips some pushes so there's not as much on the stack as there should be.  Whether this has an impact depends on a lot of factors, but typically I would assume it'd work OK, and sometimes not.  You'd probably have to write some extra assembly around all your loops and labels just to ensure the stack is in the expected state at the end.<br><br>And then we also have PowerPC assembly to consider which I know nothing about.<br><br>And there are good performance reasons to restrict how you exit out of loops.  You won't need to stick extra comparison instructions in nested loops you don't need to exit out of.  You could actually unroll some loops if you want to.

Registers=super fast, memory=super slow (a read from non-cached memory can take several cycles, which your code will have to wait on.)  You want to use registers as often as possible, preferably in any one code block read directly from a memory location once and write once.  And stack based processors would generally be optimised for using the stack as opposed to doing memory transactions all the time.  So, you push and pop constantly.<br><br>I wouldn't pretend to be all knowing about x86 assembler, but there's typically much more going on than there should be because it's all based on 1980s technology.  This is pretty much what I know of it, so some might have changed a fair bit now we're using pseudo-x86 modern processors on multi-tasking environments.<br><br>To write really quick code you need to have a very clever compiler that manages the registers and the stack well.  You also need to consider that the code you generate will typically be very generic.  You may end up writing a function that uses the stack even though it doesn't always have to, simply because it MIGHT have to.  It's far more complicated than just writing the basic code straight into its assembly equivalents.  Then you have to consider what asm the processor itself will optimise.  A missed branch prediction on a PIV CPU will have to empty the whole pipeline, which I guess means you'd want to limit the amount of branching you do.<br><br>I could probably mock up some pseudo assembly to show you what I mean, but google x86 asm and you'll probably find some perfect examples of ugliness.

All these solutions mean that changing or adding enclosing blocks is potentially dangerous.<br><br>Instead, I would tend to go with Java's solution, which allows you to 'label' a block and then use Exit with that label, eg:<br><br>#MainLoop 'In strict mode, must be followed by an 'exitable' statement<br>While blah<br>    Exit MainLoop<br>Wend<br><br>This is definitely doable. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'd like a definite yex/no so i can stop mentioning it in any relevant thread ;()<br><br>private members especially, as there are some things you dont wnat messed with. For instance, it seems that in the modules the fields starting with "_" are things you would normally have private.  Is this functional or is it just to make it harder to guess or something? However, overridden functions would be very handy because you can't use the determine type trick on builin-types, to make a function that responds to totally different data types. Having functions with different numbers of parameters isnt as useful, and more confusing, Properties are useful because they replace the theory of making a bunch of set/get functions for all your fields (so later on you can make additional code execute when something is set/gotten, or you can apply some procesing, whatever).  Using the old system people would often create massive lists of set/get functions so later on you could add code while keeping back-compatability.  Properties changes that.  You access fields like they should be.  As variables.  When you want to make a property for a field, you make the actual field private, change its name a bit, create a property with get/set methods inside.  Then, you maintain back compatability and field-syntax. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
