This results in an lag between user input and output on the screen which is unacceptable for action games or games with a mouse pointer (that's pretty much all games then).<br><br>Several fixes were proposed and the "final" proposed fix was this (to be placed after your Flip command):<br><br><pre class=code>

'low poly and high fill rate causes the issue, solvable by flushing the driver's
'buffered frames using grab pixmap or locking a buffer with a large speed penalty.
'opengl is unaffected.

'change how many loops you do till you see the lag and not general slowdown

Turning off the fix makes the game framework run fine.  Bummer.  The fix works fine on Radeons and other video cards.<br><br>I tried Indiepath's module tweak i.e. change the Flip method of TD3D7Device in d3d7graphics.bmx to:<br><pre class=code>

</pre><br>and also change Method GetFlipStatus() in dd.bmx to 	Method GetFlipStatus(flags) then rebuild modules.<br><br>The idea behind this being it only outputs a frame when it can do thus saving processor cycles.  However, this causes a problem with the square example above where it only seems to draw every second or so, so it looks really jerky.<br><br>So basically this issue is raised again as it is not yet solved unfortunately... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This is currently "normal" for Blitz Max, even if it's rubbish.  Hopefully Skidaracer might fix this.  Have you tried the above code in full-screen mode i.e. change graphics to 800,600,32?  You shouldn't get any vertical tearing (unless there is a driver issue) but it will look a bit jerky just because of the huge loop being too much work for the PC to do in a single frame.  What I need to try is Indiepaths new code, or One Eyed Jack's old code, OR Sswifts tips in my Game FRamework to see if it's better on geforce cards.  Can't do that until Monday though...<br><br>As for the OpenGl Driver, you shouldn't experience lag with it, as in move that square areound a lot and let go of the keys, it should stop immediately.  It doesn't do this in DirectX. In windowed mode you'll still get vertical tearing in OPenGL mode plus it will look jerky due to the loop size.  This is normal for any card.  In fact, I'm going to try my FRamework test in OpenGL as well to check everything is smooth.<br><br>Has anyone noticed that if you run the above test in OpenGL mode, there is a tiny lag, about 1 frame or something.  Try tapping a key really fast.  The square seems to move as you finger is coming off the key.  If you do the same in directX with the fix ON, it moves instantly (just that tiny bit quicker). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you're using millisecond timing you can only get up to 1000 or so, unless maybe you're incremeting a counter and calculating the number of frames that were rendered after a second has passed, or maybe doing some kind of timer averaging over multiple frames so that times of 0 and 1 repeating forever give you 2000.<br><br>Anyway do you know how much of a difference between 1400fps and 1600fps?  1400fps is 0.7ms per frame.  1600fps is 0.6ms per frame.  Thats a difference of a TENTH of a millisecond!<br><br>It might be a 200fps diffference, but what are you going to do in 200 frames that take a tenth of a millisecond to render?  Not much.  In fact, I'd say it'd be downright impossible to actually do any real game stuff in that amount of time.  That means that your real world framerates will be lower.  And that means more time between frames.  A LOT more.  And that means that if you're running at 100fps, there's TEN milliseconds in between each frame.  Indiepath's method will cost you only one TENTH of a millisecond, total, over the course of TWO THOUSAND frames.  Divide 1/10th by 2000 and you get a verrrrry tiny number.  That's how much time you lose per frame.<br><br>In other words, your methodology is magnifying the difference between your two functions so greatly that it LOOKS like there's a big difference between your two methods, but in fact your method is less than 10% faster, and the amount of time either takes is so tiny as to be insignificant in the 0.00005th degree.  (That's 0.1/2000)<br><br>Therefore you should go with the method that works better. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
