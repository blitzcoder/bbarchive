Large scale planning is no longer an integral part of developing software.<br><br>The reasons are many, but the most important one is that unlike traditional manufactured goods or building, constructing software is not something you can plan ahead, because you're trying to hit a moving target.<br><br>When you're building a house, you can be pretty sure that in the middle of production, you won't have to suddenly start adding a basement, or having to build it twice as wide, and half as tall. When building a car, you can be pretty sure it's not supposed to be able to fly aswell.<br><br>When building software however, these certainties cannot be taken for granted. Hardware changes, software changes, changes in what the user/customer needs/wants, competeing products etc. all combine to make software infinitly more complex than all other traditional forms of production.<br><br>Thus traditional engineering methods, such as those deployed in the past, are not effective at controling and managing quality software (as the huge ammount of absolutely terrible software available substantiates). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I disagree though. What you are presenting is a philosophy. While Mark may not choose to put every detail in his planning, large scale planning IS important (question is, what IS "large" scale planning ofcourse).<br><br>If you have a company, primary target is to make money. Period. And for that you need a business plan and a project plan, which contains all the financial details. And, you can't give financial details with a proper idea of what your product is going to be, and write this down as such.<br><br>And, I never said planning is something static, something that you keep and hold for the whole project. It's dynamic and flexible.<br><br>I am a project coordinator by "nature". For a large game project I am working on (commercial game, not Blitz) planning is very, very important The whole game is broke down into clusters and seperate tasks for teams. I also wrote a special collaborate CMS (online) for game planning. Not that this all justifies my opinion, but I'm just saying that I know where I'm talking about.<br><br>The least a project needs (if there's no project plan), is a roadmap with some details. And yes, those details can change! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This is mainly because, although I know *what* I want the architecture to be capable of, I'm not totally sure about *how* to achieve it!<br><br>The biggest architectural improvement I want to make is the addition of a  decent culling/occlusion system. While many of hobbiest 3D engines/languages can do things like display quake levels, oct-trees, terrains etc, they all tend to work in isolation - ie: very few can cull entities within a quake level using the quake level's vis.<br><br>So, the thing I'd like to achieve here is to be able to do things like 'insert this quake level into this quad-tree node of this terrain' etc. And then, be able to 'insert this statically bounded animation into this sector of the quake level' and so on. But to keep it generalized - eg: so the architecture doesn't need to know about quake levels, oct-trees etc - is a challenge! Note: by quake level I really just mean 'some kind of culling/occlusion system'.<br><br>I spent many hours with a pen and paper trying to suss this out - but hadn't really achieved anything. However, out of the blue the other day, I had the germ of an idea of how such an architecture might look and will be following that up very soon.<br><br>I pretty much agree with Flameduck's 'manifesto' - I think most programmers would - but my favourite article on software design would have to be: <a href="http://www.developerdotstar.com/mag/articles/reeves_design_main.html" target="_blank">http://www.developerdotstar.com/mag/articles/reeves_design_main.html</a><br><br>...the main point being that the only true software design is a piece of code that actually does what it's supposed to do. Which does not negate the value of high level planning or abstract design, but more just recognizes that the process of creating a 'good design' carries on right through until the last line of code is written. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
