Anything that reduces the amount of actual coding required. The idea is to remove the variable 'declaring' part and get Max to auto-declare accordingly<br><br>As an example:<br><pre class=code>
' BEFORE
Global font:TImageFont = LoadImageFont("somefont.ttf")

' AFTER
Global font:= LoadImageFont("somefont.ttf")
</pre><br>This method ties in nicely with existing shortcuts (such as :+ and :- )<br>Gets my vote<br><br>#2 - Case sensitive naming<br>======================================<br>Touched upon as a consideration. Again, a welcome improvement<br>However, this ideally would be an optional higher 'strict' level<br>I can't think off hand what would make a good directive name (MegaStrict / UltraStrict) ?<br><pre class=code>
Strict
SuperStrict

and now .. the mother of all spankings:

UltraStrict     ' Case sensitive checking
</pre><br><br>Feel free to discuss other 'improvements' you can think of<br><br><br>One other suggestion I can think of is the <b>If .. Then .. Else</b> shortcut<br><pre class=code>
' INSTEAD OF
If spriteposX&gt;gfxWidth Then AlienX=25 Else AlienX=45
' SHORTCUT
AlienX = (spriteposX&gt;gfxWidth) ? 25 : 45

(You can't do this in 'Max.)<br><br>You can do: <b>rocket.rocket = CreateRocket ()</b> in Blitz2D/3D, ie. a variable can have the same name <i>and</i> case as a type, but as things were arranged differently behind the scenes in 'Max (in ways I do not pretend to understand), I assume <i>rocket.Rocket</i> would be a possibility in the 'new' case-sensitive world, while <i>rocket.rocket</i> might not, given the reference to differentiating based on case-sensitivity (ie. both variable and type are the same in the case of <i>rocket.rocket</i>).<br><br>I'm not sure I think it's worth the confusion any more, but why someone would want a variable or type called rocket and a separate variable or type called Rocket, I truly cannot fathom.<br><br>Or, to put it another way, <i>who in their right mind is going to oppose case insensitivity</i>?!<br><br>I'm sure (by which I mean I <i>pray</i>) that if Mark intends full case-sensitivity, it would be totally optional. Differentiating between variables and types based on case-sensitivity I can handle, but like <i>SuperStrict</i> I think that preventing me from doing what I <i>want</i> to do (as in <i>rocket:rocket</i> or <i>rocket:Rocket</i>) might actually be a good idea after all... !<br><br>Still, I have to ask: why on earth would you want (variables) <b><i>rocket:Int</i></b>/<b><i>Rocket:Int</i></b>, or (types) <b><i>r:rocket</i></b>/<b><i>r:Rocket</i></b>, to be treated differently? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You propose it for a C standard and I'm sure you'll have a riot.  The point is opposing case sensitivity because, god forbid, someone might do something stupid is in itself a stupid argument.  You can already do plenty of stupid things in BlitzMax, and you will always be able to do something stupid in any language ever created.  (With the exception of INTERCAL, which would probably lecture you if you do something stupid.)  The only argument anyone here has against case sensitivity is that they'll think of it as an inconvenience, <i>not</i> because you can do something stupid or because they think it's somehow a flaw in language design.  I think everyone should just admit that much and stop making up horrible reasons that they think are technical flaws. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's really, REALLY annoying. I know there are some benefits to it, like making sure you are referring to the correct variables and all that. But it IS much easier to not HAVE to think about it. I'll for it so long as it's optional, and I think if mark is considering making things easier for beginners then he won't make it mandatory to have to type everything so exactly. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

IMO not worth it.<br>2) I think it does not fit in a BASIC language, and personally think it does only hamper the devs. If your team is writing rocket, Rocket and rockeT all over the place, they need to be whipped around with a large trout.<br><br>What is infinitely mode valuable, especially for beginner programmers, is having a coding style tutorial. From my web development past I traditionally use lowercase_with_underscore for variables, lowerUpperCamelCase() for functions and CamelCase for type/class declaration. While some purists may abhor mixing casing styles in code, this way I can instantly recognize the broad nature of a specific thing in my code.<br><br>Frankly, enforcing it at the compiler level is attacking the symptom, not the cause. Learn good coding practices and agree with your team to use a consistent coding style, and the different-coding-style will never hit you. Different styles in coding is a project standardization/communication problem, not a compiler problem.<br><br>3) Now, this is one thing I like. While it might take a little bit for beginners to get used to, it's not overly daunting, and several short,simple if-then-elses can be replaced with the ternary operator. I am all for it. Seriously, if a beginner programmer is too thick-headed to understand that it is a simplified if-then-else with no elseif, (s)he shouldn't be coding at all.<br><br>4)Now yeah, the bigger fish to fry. While we are at it, If we are going to have operator overloading, function overloading could come along for the ride too. <br><br>Granted, it's a bit of an advanced concept, but beginners don't have to use them at first. You will only wish those features when you want to go a bit further, optimize/simplify some part of your code. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
