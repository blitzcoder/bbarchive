git clone git://github.com/nilium/blitzmax.tmbundle.git</pre>Or you can alternatively click the 'download' link, and extract the archive's contents into a BlitzMax.tmbundle directory under the directory in the above command.<br><br>If you think you might want to make additions to it, I would encourage you to use git so you can commit and push your changes to the remote repository, or possibly fork the project using GitHub.<br><br><strike>This most likely will not work in E right now, as I haven't tested the recent version (what's up there) yet.  It likely only requires a few changes in the build code to work, mainly due to e's dependency on Cygwin.</strike>  <i>Scratch that, works in E now.</i><br><br>I'm not sure if the drag commands work right now either.  I can't find anything wrong with the code, but at the same time there's no output from them.

Right now it's just calling `bmk makeapp "$TM_FILEPATH"`, so it's not terribly sophisticated.  I'm thinking that I'll split it into Build GUI App and Build Console App so that you have that much choice.  Not sure if there's a good way to handle other options like threading (-h) without splitting them into four commands, two for threaded and two for unthreaded.  I suppose I could have it check for build flags in the file being compiled.  E.g.,<pre class=code>'buildopt threaded
'buildopt gui</pre>But if I did that, I would probably limit it to stop after it gets to the first non-blank/comment line so you don't have it checking the entire source file every time you build.<br><br>Would be neat if BMK had that sort of thing built in, actually.  I might have to do that just for myself.<br><br>Edit: Also, for projects, I'm thinking about having a TM_BLITZMAX_MAINFILE shell variable that you can set so when you hit 'build' in a project, it'll build that file regardless of which file you've got open.

This is not optional, you will not be able to get by with putting it in your PATH.  In order for the bundle to function as intended, it has to be set, and I decided I'm not going to let some things fail and others work.<br><br>Secondly, for projects is that you'll have to rename your TM_BMX_MAINFILE shell variable to TM_BLITZMAX_MAIN_FILE.  This is to keep in line with the naming scheme used in other TextMate bundles, as I'm working on improving this to the point where it can be reviewed for inclusion with other 'official' (using that loosely) bundles.  If you did not use this feature, it doesn't affect you.<br><br><b>There is now a Help command which should explain anything you need to do in order to get the bundle working.</b><br><br>I've added a bunch more snippets and cleaned up some others, the highlighting should be improved since I've continued to work on the language grammar.  There was a case-indent branch on github for people who didn't like the Case/Default indentation options.  I've decided to just outright remove those and let you figure out how you want to indent them.  As such, the case-indent branch is gone. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

(?x) specifies that whitepsace in the regex will be ignored, and your starting marker has none in the first place.  You'll want the option (?i) for case insensitivity, and to have a \b at the end of each of those markers if you want them to not match unusual things (e.g., TypeOfDog).  That's just my 2 cents if you want to continue using your changes. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

}</textarea><br><br>This is the current grammar I'm working with and is ahead of the current revision just a bit (mostly due to the change in the way numbers are included and nicer handling of attributes).  Nothing has changed with the folding markers for a little while (certainly not between 11231 and the current), but if you've changed anything in the grammar you may have introduced problems, so I'd suggest copying/pasting that copy of the grammar. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
