<table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr ><td class="posthead"><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr ><td >ziggy</td><td align="right"><font class=tiny>(Posted 2012)</font>&nbsp;<a href="#1">[#1]</a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr ><td class="posttext"> Hello!<br><br>A new BLIde Plus update is available to BLIde Plus users.<br><br>For newcomers, <a href="http://www.blide.org" target="_blank">BLIde Plus</a> is a Windows BlitzMax IDE that provides many features for authoring, modifying, compiling, deploying and debugging games and applications written in BlitzMax. It also provides a complete intellisense system, code folding, and a long list of useful features. For more information see here: <a href="http://www.blide.org" target="_blank">http://www.blide.org</a> and here: <a href="http://www.blide.org/?page_id=357" target="_blank">http://www.blide.org/?page_id=357</a> <br><br>This new version has several imporant improvements both in performance and in stability. The main change on this new build is that it is using a newer .net framework, the .net framework version 4.0 With this new framework I've been able to implement a new memory handling mechanism that should allow BLIde to use less resources in a more efficient way. Also, it's faster and has a higher level of internal multui-thread operations that should bring a nice speed improvement on modern computers.<br><br>While this version is still x86, I'll be providing an universal version in future updates (so it'll be native on x86 and on x64). <br><br>This is the detailed changelog for this new version:<br><br><div class="quote"> <br>BLIde version 12.09.1301 SP1 <br>• Fixed an issue that could make BLIde crash on a Find&amp;Replace operation where there was a specific set of open tabs on the editor documents container<br><br>• Fixed a small backwards compatibility issue with very old BLIde versions. Unmanaged BLIde files done with very first versions of BLIde could be not compatible with latest version. This has been fixed.<br><br>• Fixed an issue that could make BLIde crash after a folder had been renamed on the managed solution explorer<br><br>• Added a new dialog to inform on BLIde updates. This new dialog shows the lists of changes in the notification window.<br><br>• The whole IDE and associated tools have been ported to the .net framework 4.0<br><br>• New thread-based GC internally used on BLIde that increases performance on multicore machines or machines that have proper HiperThreading<br><br>• New memory optimization algorithm that prevents a possible Out Of Memory crash.<br><br>• Several internal BLIde tasks have been parallelized so BLIde is more responsive and fast on complex parsing and text operations <br><br>• Removed all references to a legacy compatibility DLL BLIde was using. This DLL is not compatible with x64 bits version of .net. BLIde currently works as a 32 bits application, but we're testing a universal portable version of it that should run as 32 or 64 bits depending on computer capabilities. This DLL dependency removal is part of this process.<br><br>• IMPORTANT: This is the last version to support the creation of deprecated legacy .blide project files. This old format has been marked in the ide as deprecated for more than two years. Next BLIde version will still be able to load this documents and modify this documents, but you won't be able to create them. You should use the superior managed or unmanaged solutions system. <br> <br></div><br><br>You don't have to worry about having the .net framework 4.0 already installed on your system, the update process will detect it automatically and install it for you if you do not currently have it. Anyway, if your computer has been updated due regular windows update process, or if you're using Jungle Ide, you should already have it on your machine.<br><br>Hope you like it!<br><br>EDIT: Forgot to mention that any BLIde Plugin developed by any third-party will still be compatible with this version, but they will be loaded and run under the .net 4.0 framework. Theorically most compatibility issues have been ironed out and the whole BLIde SDK API has been proved to behave with proper backwards compatibility but if you're using any incompatible unmanaged or deprecated code in a Plug-in, it may need to be re-compiled and maybe modified to be compatible with latest BLIde. None of the Plugins I know have this problems, but if anyone needs assistance with this, I'll be happy to help<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But anyway, you should know that an IDE does not modify the language features so it is nonsense to pretend BLIde to modify the capabilities of BlitzMax debugger. I would love BlitzMax to improve lists and maps (and other things) debugging but it hasn't and there's nothinh I can do. If you have an idea how this could be changed in the language, I'll siupport the change in the IDE. Otherwise, it's better to not talk about what you don't understand.<br><br><div class="quote"> Well, maybe commercial version had decent techical support? No, it's appailing. This man seems to like just ignore customers' posts on official forum. Maybe he even doesn't visiting it for months. <br></div>Forun support is open for free users and supposed to be community driven. If you have the Plus version, you have an integrated "Request support" in the IDE wich is direct license-based customer's service. People who have used it knows it's worth it and I haven't had any single issue unresolved since 2005. Obviously if you keep requesting BLIde to modify BlitzMax debugger on the forums, you may get ignored as this is something that has to be modified on the compiler and language, not in the IDE.<br><br><div class="quote"> Not to mention stupid marketing strategy, all those "N months of updates" - pure kindergarden.  <br></div>Thanks for the final insult. It's been very welcome and absolutely a must.

Do you think people releasing software under a GPL spends their time dissasembling other people's work just to find out if they're violating the license? A license grants you the right to use someone else's work. If you do not buy BLIde Plus you can't use BLIde Plus for commercial development no mather how can I check it or not. Licesing is not DRM. I love BLIde not having DRM.<br><br>By the way, suggesting people to use warez software (and use BLIde Free for commercial use is using warez software) is not allowed in this forum AFAIK.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you don't like BLIde and you're in the test peroid feel free to request for a refund.

If you don't, I will, as I don't want this thread to beacome a kinder garden discussion.<br><br>EDIT: And just one final consideraion:<br>If I would have made a demo version of BLIde that just work for 30 days, I'm sure I would have earned much more monney, but I haven't becouse I wanted to give something free to this community, support the language, and help people love BlitzMax. There are lots of people that have been using the Free edition, without paying a cent, for years. The download counts are enormous and I could have seen it as lost money, probably that's what it is, but I really don't care that much as long as I feel I'm helping people while I can also get some monetary support from the paid version to continue development.

The only big difference I can see is that the free version is for non-commercial use and the plus version is for commercial use. I would like to see BlitzPlus/Blitz3D support in BLIde soon.

BLIde was not designed in a very modular way and removing BlitzMax from it whould be a titanic work (and if I make BLIde for Blitz3D, it should work for people that does not have BlitzMax). It would be much easier to make a Jungle Ide version for Blitz3D and Blitz Plus, but given the fact that most users are currently using IDEaL (wich is great and free) or just have moved to Max or Monkey, I don't see it as a very viable project right now that I'm so focused on finishing the BLIde port to x64 and .net 4, and also into a new commercial project that hopefully will see the light in a year more or less <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Another update available:<br><div class="quote"> BLIde version 13.01.2701 SP1 <br>• Improved the Help Search algorithm. It now also produces partial matches on the keyword matching algorithm.<br><br>• Now BLIde will only allow to create To Do items when there's a solution loaded, so they are always attached to the solution, preventing to do list items getting lost after a BLIde restart.<br><br>• Rewritten part of the modules cache creation algorithm so it's now a lot faster by parallelizing the whole thing into processing cores. That's very notorious when executed on a SSD.<br><br>• Fixed a bug on the BlitzMax text renderer which could make BLIde crash when scrolling a very large document that contained lots of syntax errors and the bug analyzer was running too fast<br> <br></div><br><br>Hope you find it useful! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
