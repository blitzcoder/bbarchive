When I open the one I want to use, that means, I want to just fire it up and get on with it, fair do's if it does a little update on the app I'm using, but, if I have to sit and wait while it updates other stuff too and I'm sitting twiddling me thumbs, it would put me off.<br><br>Fussy yes, and heres me sitting on a half decent broadband connection, but, if I was using something that was only downloading at 3-5kb/s and it was doing that, I wouldnt bother with it.<br><br>Granted, this is all sorta based on speculation, but, its just my 2 pence worth! ;)<br><br>Dabz<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If the update process is part of the app itself, then it's much better, becouse this way the update service will be able to self-update. Also, the less bandwith it uses, the better for the final user. I would also suggest you to make this service as much uninstrusive as possible. I hate it when I have to launch an external app in order to see if there are updates, then, download the update, launch it manually, pass the UAC dialog, then pass the install process, then launch the application again just to see there's another patch available...<br>If you make it simple and user friendly, it'll be much better and you'll have an updated users base. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
