Regardless of what they represent or in what base you're interpreting them, you can only ever toggle a bit on or off.<br><br>So let's say the the floating point format has 8 bits to the right of the decimal point with which to represent numbers. The bit values for each column, as an exact fraction, will be:<br><br>%00000001 = 1/256th<br>%00000010 = 1/128th<br>%00000100 = 1/64th<br>%00001000 = 1/32th<br>%00010000 = 1/16th<br>%00100000 = 1/8th<br>%01000000 = 1/4th<br>%10000000 = 1/2th<br><br>So then, the only way to represent a number is to switch one of these bits on or off. You might tell, therefore, that this does not give you as much accuracy as you might desire.<br><br>For example, there is absolutely no way that, by setting a bit in any combination of these columns, that you can represent 1/3rd. You could get pretty close but you only have 8 bits to play with. Beyond the closeness you can get with the 8 bits you basically discard any other bits you might need and round the number. The rounding is an error, an incuraccy in the actual number.<br><br>Numbers with infinite decimal places like 1/3 cannot ever EVER be accurately represented by a number system that is based on multiples of 2, or 1/2's. Binary cannot represent a third of a value. For other numbers, there are also lots of occasions where you try to put an exact number in, but the float or double only get `so accurate` before reaching the limit of how many bits it has available. <br><br>Even though floats and doubles have a very large range of values that you can represent, within which you CAN represent SOME numbers with exact accuracy (like 0.5), or any Integer, but there are also lots of other numbers that it just can't map to accurately.<br><br>0.1 cannot be accurately represented in binary. You can do 1/8th but not 1/10th. That's why you see it round up the last digit to a 1 - it's probably some fraction of a bit that it can't represent any more closely, mainly because 0.1 has too many decimal places in binary.<br><br>You can increase the accuracy by using a Double which basically just gives you extra bits to work with, so the number is `chopped off less` and at a smaller measure, so any error is much less, but still some in most cases.<br><br>Since you can't easily tell how much a number will be rounded up or down, you have to start thinking of using a `tolerance`, so if the number is `within` such-and-such an amount of the number you want, then it's considered equal, otherwise considered non-equal. The only time you can do a real `=` between two floats or two doubles is if you are storing the exact same number into it. If you try writing a constant into it it will be transformed as it becomes a floating point number and comparing that to the original constant will potentially be off.<br><br>You could consider using fixed point numbers and do your own handling of them, but even they wont represent 0.1 as 0.10000000. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
