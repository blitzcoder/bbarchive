The pixel data is stored RGBA in either case, it just compares the alpha channel value for the pixels unless I'm mistaken which means it makes no difference what is stored in the RGB portion. 0,0,0,255 takes just as long to check as 255,255,255,255, they're both 4 bytes so iteration and splitting them apart is not affected by it's content.<br><br>Mask collision is different, you only need 1 bit per pixel instead of the full 4 byte RGBA set, so there's less data to crawl and you don't need to split the pixels... however since the data is still stored in bytes you have to address each bit in the byte to get to each of the bits in it, not sure what the overhead in max is for that level operation vs decoding a 4 byte pixel and comparing the alpha bytes... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It seems to me that if you can render at 1400FPS <i>internally</i>, but even top end monitors are pushing 120hz or possibly 240hz, that a lot of processor/GPU time is wasted on unusable data (at 1400FPS, for example, 1280 frames are discarded, essentially, every second on a 120hz display). And then of course, there's the fact that the human eye (well, brain really) can't even distinguish more than about 75 to 100 or so frames per second.<br><br>If you're using this figure to compare various algorithms or hardware, then I can see where it might matter, otherwise it seems to be a  moot point.<br><br>Russell <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

For actual production you should throttle your frame rate so you don't end up burning CPU and Gpu time for no reason. Simple way to do it is just enable vsync with flip(1). If you can render at 2k fps on a min spec system it just means you  have a LOT of room to grow (time for more advanced ai, more objects on screen, etc.). If you're at say 45fps then you can't really afford much more, and should really look into optimizing things to get room for background tasks etc. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Now that we have processors and GPUs capable of doing some impressive physics and texturing, is the next hurdle the AI or just more on-board texture memory for extremely detailed worlds? AI has come a long way since the 80's, but is still not quite there, as far as I'm concerned (referring to game AI, not the stuff being worked on at the finest technical colleges in the world).<br><br>Would a graphics card 100x faster than anything available today with, say, 16GB (or more) of texture/world memory be earth-shattering? Probably, but only if the imaginations of the game developers can utilize it to its fullest potential. Imagine a game like Super Mario World rendered as though it were real: Super-realistic textures (Mario's skin and clothes, for example) and creature behavior, physics, etc. It would be a completely different KIND of game, but would it be more fun?
