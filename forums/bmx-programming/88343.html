What I mean is assign "Float Ptr"s to sequencers by picking them up from the arrays. That way, the sequencers update only what they need to.

What you could do is have your particle pool as an array. You could start with a size that fits most applications, then double it each time you need more particles. Say you start with 128. If you need 129, make the array 256. If you then need 257, make it 512. That way you'll have 4-5 reallocations of the array in the entire runtime of the application.<br><br>Once you got that set up, you can make a second array that could be encoded in bits (since you need just a boolean flag). So for each int in the array, you could remember the state of 32 particles (active or not).<br><br>That way when you remove a particle, you flag it as inactive. All other particles get to keep their pointers.<br><br>What I was referring to earlier about sequencers was that you can create a sequencer, give it a rule (linear interpolation, sine wave, etc.) and a Float Ptr that points somewhere in one of the arrays inside the generator. That way you ONLY update sequencers that actually exist. There's also less memory waste, as there are just as many sequencers defined as there are active (you no longer hold another field - pointer to sequencer - for every field in your particle).<br><br>As for the final assembly of the vertex arrays... it's not going to be as fast as I presumed in my first post. Instead of just pointing to that array, you'll have to build a new one based on the active particles. You should probably check and MemCopy as many particles at once as possible. Check for consecutive particles flagged as "active" and bulk-copy them to the final vertex array.<br><br>I'm really sorry that I don't have some code to show you right now. Currently my particle engine is going through a rewrite and will probably end up as I just wrote above. I am curious myself to find out just how fast it can be.<br>I wrote something similar to this (a ribbon/trail system) and got to 1700-2200 fps with 10000 points on the trail. I seem to have hit the bottleneck of the GPU as the CPU never went above 70% while my early tests kept it at 100%. The trick is that I am doing 2 MemCopys and process just 1 node (2 vertices) per frame.<br><br>That's probably a bit off-topic so I'll end this post here :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
