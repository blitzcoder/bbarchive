As a result, although I started coding a wrapper, I very quickly realised that I don't have the required knowledge of wxWidgets to be able to take on something like that.

I can't remember exactly which lines were changed, but if you have a look at <i>fl_read_image.cxx</i> you should be able to find it. I did comment a few of the changes, but others I just edited silently, so it may be best to DIFF revision 68 with the original 1.1.9 file to find out exactly what was changed.
