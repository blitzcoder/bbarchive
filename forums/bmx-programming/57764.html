</pre><br><br><br>The user will call Animate.PositionX(Sprite, etc...) to start a new X position animation for a sprite.  If I did not make that Create() function just now, then in the PositionX() function, I would have had to have: <br>Anim = New Animate<br>Anim.Link = AnimList.AddLast(Anim)<br><br>Which would have been just:<br>Anim = New Animate<br>AnimList.AddLast(Anim)<br><br>Except that I had forgotten to add the anim objects to the list, and it would not have required a third line as I thought it would to assign the new link to the type.<br><br>But anyway, the way I ended up doing it is cleaner.  Now I don't even need that AnimList.AddLast(Anim) thing in each of those animation creation functions.  I suppose I could even get rid of a whole MESS of default variable initialisations actually.  Like um... Age = -1.  Well maybe not that many.  I guess I could change the create function to take some parameters though.  Sprite, transform, time, flags, triggerdelaye, freesprite, startage, speed...  All those could just be passed to the create function and I wouldn't have to assign them in every helper function.<br><br>Hmm.. I could even stick FreeTriggered in there.  This will clean up the code significantly.<br><br>On second thought... I don't even want FreeTriggered there.  That's a bug that has been in my AniBOB system I guess.  Now that I think about it, that is not a good idea now that there is a trigger delay in the two systems.  That means an animation playing currently would be shut off immediately if you add one to the queue, even if the new one doesn't trigger immediately.  The update function should delete those triggered anims properly so this isn't even needed here.  I think. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
