(I know it's a bit of a dodgy name to have but I can't think of a better one) - BRL: please let me know if you have any issues to do with it being called Max'd GUI and I'll change it.<br><br>In short, Max'd GUI is a visual GUI editor for BlitzMax (like GUIde) created using BlitzMax (so it should be cross-platform). I've done a complete introduction <a href="/logs/userlog.php?user=1793&amp;log=690" target="_blank">here</a>, so let me know what you think.<br><br><a href="/logs/userlog.php?user=1793&amp;log=690" target="_blank"><img src="http://members.aol.com/sebhollington123/blitz/exporting.png"> (Click for More Information)</a><br><br><b>Features already in Max'd GUI:</b><br><br>&gt; Cross Platform - I don't have access to a Mac yet to compile on but I haven't used any Non BlitzMax commands so all should be well.<br>&gt; Fully customizable gadget names, text, size, position, flags<br>&gt; Code can be exported into BMX format at the click of a button, and then compiled or opened into your editor at your discretion. Code is SuperStrict compliant.<br>&gt; Projects can be saved and loaded from/to Max'd GUI.<br>&gt; Includes a full item editor to add items to combo boxes and listboxes<br>&gt; Flags can be set using check boxes and radio buttons.<br><br>Because of the long amount of time it has taken me to think and develop all ideas and code (many late nights), my intention is for it to be a commercial project.<br><br>As such, any good commerical project should have its target market in mind and my target market is you (well those who have Max GUI and BlitzMax anyways). Have a flick through the introduction and let me know of any ideas, comments and additions you want added to the project: Tell me what you like and what you don't like. I know it's hard to judge from screenies but please try your best.<br><br>Would any of you be interested in purchasing such a package?<br><br>Thanks for the comments<br><br><br>Seb <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I for one am not not sure about all these GUI-editors in the first place. Somehow I don't feel this is how proper apps are being made. One-shot apps perhaps, apps that don't grow too big.. but for large apps otoh I'd usually say a large part of a GUI (if not all) can or should be dynamically created based on whether or not you're using a related component.<br><br>It's a different way of thinking. I can only speak for myself ofcourse, but with GUI-builders I usually get the impression one starts with a GUI concept to later fill in the code, while I prefer to start with a functionality concept, no GUI whatsoever. Usually, an app is made out of various smaller parts and each part should have its own private GUI rather than tuning in on a globally designed GUI. Because a private GUI should imho be part of each individual component, you'll get to the point of dynamically generated gadgets, or to a point where it doesn't pay off to use a GUI editor at all. I mean, everyone can type a gadget-create command, right? Gadget-dimensions usually depend on technical limits/properties/functionality rather than human influences or even art! (e.g. where you need a form editor to resize all gadgets until you see the perfect layout)<br><br>Now, when every part of the app has its own private functionality and GUI you can assume that every bit and byte is local. If every part has a button to update itself (just assume it), called "Updatebutton" then you can create as many different parts as you like, no interference whatsoever.<br>When I see all those gadget globals in your source (they're generated output from your form-editor I guess?) then this will create the usual problems with globals if you intend to have similar functions per part. That's why I'd put a GUI into an instance, everything nice 'n private.<br><br>Ohwell, perhaps I shouldn't have mentioned it at all.. :P Somewhere I can see how a form-editor can help beginners, esp. if they've no former GUI experience. So, just go on and please them, and ignore my monologue. (orso :P) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That is programs that load into multiple tabs, and where the content changes depending on what is happening. I made a Remote Control client recently in BlitzMax where the whole UI was created dynamically and at-run-time to meet the user's need.<br><br>However, some apps require a static interface with only basic changes, such as Disabling/Enabling gagdets and changing text etc. In which case, a GUI-editor can save hours of time. Usually, these applications are designed to perform a series of tasks, and the UI of the app is there to allow easy input, not as a core feature of the app itself (lol, if you see what I mean).<br><br>It all depends on what you are doing really - but a GUI editor is usually the best option for the job.<br><br><b>LESTROSO:</b><br>Step 1 complete: got my hands on an old B&amp;W G3<br>Step 2 complete: Bought Apple OS 9<br>Step 3: Waiting for it to arrive (should be anyday soon)<br><br>As soon as it comes, I will compile and upload a demo for you. :-P<br><br><br>Seb <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you really need it, I could release it on a BETA license I suppose, but it would be sold "as is" until there is an update where you will be upgraded automatically. By "as is", I mean:<br><br>&gt; No Menu-Editor<br>&gt; Still A Few Bugs<br>&gt; Not Fully Functioning Code Builder<br>&gt; Windows Only (Very Possible Linux As Well)<br><br>I suppose this is what I wanted to avoid by only releasing it when it is ready - however if you *really* want it, e-mail me and we'll sort something out!<br><br>Also, for Mac, I need to get the code to look presentable so I can send it Skid (having kindly offered) for debugging - it seems to crash after adding a few objects on OS X PPC and I think it must be MaxGUI freeing objects before it is ready.<br><br>Many thanks for your patience, and I apologize once again,<br><br><br>Seb <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
