You're basically trying to almost do two alphablends at the same time. You can't do that with normal hardware setup. To create alphablending you have to perform a scaling of the source RGB colors, combined with a scaling of the existing destination colors. This doesn't leave any options for doing any other additional blending at the same time. You'd have to move to at least 2 passes.<br><br>However, if you are willing to have a second copy of each sprite, which is an all-white-pixel copy of the sprite, but with the same alpha-channel information as the original, then you can use a combination of LIGHTBLEND and SetColor to brighten your separately-rendered RGB sprite.<br><br>So .... <br><br>1. Make a proper full color sprite with alpha channel.<br>2. Turn all pixels to pure white and keep the alpha channel - this is the second image. You can do this easily by copying the first sprite to a new pixmap and then going through and writing $FF,$FF,$FF to the RGB components, but keeping the alpha.<br>3. Draw the first image in AlphaBlend as normal, or whatever general appearance you want.<br>4. SetColor to anything between $FF,$FF,$FF and $0,$0,$0 to decide how much white will be applied.<br>5. SetBlend LightBlend and draw the all-white sprite over the original. Depending on the SetColor it will draw that amount of white. The less white it draws the more transparently it draws the white, so at $10,$10,$10 you see a little bit of lightening, at $80,$80,$80 you see all pixel increased by $80. Then at $FF,$FF,$FF you definitely will flood out all pixels to white.<br><br>I think this will work but you do need two copies of the sprite. Lightblend also alphablends at the same time, right? SetColor only fades colors DOWN, which is why you have to fade down from white - hence you need to start out with originally white pixels.<br><br>One thing to bare in mind is this is not a `brightness` function - it doesn't scale the RGB values by an equal percentage, it's an ADD function that tops out at white - so basically the same as photoshops `lighten` rather than `brightness. But it works and will be the same on DX and GL.<br><br>If you want to not have a second copy of the sprite, things are going to get much more complicated, if not impossible. I can't think of any way to do it in one pass because you already use up the blending operations available by doing an alphablend. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Usually to do alphablending you'll scale the source pixel value by this, and then you'll scale the destination pixel by 1.0-thatvalue. This is because the result of both multiplications are then adedd together and you want the whole result to always = 1.0. Ie SourceBlendedValue+DestBlendedValue=1.0.<br><br>However, if you set the destination factor to be GL_ONE, that means the destination is not scale down at all. So it will be Source(0.5)+Dest(1.0)=1.5 ... this is then clamped to 1.0, so when the source pixel and the destination pixel added together is &gt;1.0 it will turn into white.<br><br>The only problem with this is that the alphablending is interfered with in a strange way. I think you might only be able to get it to look like it is blending from 0.0 to 0.5 ie it might only let you have up to 50% transparency. I'm not sure. Just try it and see how it looks at different transparency levels.<br><br>So..<br><br>SetBlend AlphaBlend<br>SetColor $FF,$FF,$FF<br>glEnable(GL_BLEND) 'note this may interfere with max2d state<br>glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA,GL_ONE)<br>DrawImage<br><br>You might find that changing the SetColor has an unexpected affect as well. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Modulate 4x is like add blending three copies of a sprite over itself.  <br><br>It increases the brightness 2x or 4x respectively, but as it only has the colors of the object to work with it can never make a dark green pixel anything other than a bright green pixel.  It cannot push a saturated color pixel to white.<br><br>My sprite system already does 2X with the two pass method, as that method allows you to vary the brightness by varying the SetColor for the add pass.  In my system if you set the color of a sprite over 255 then this second pass kicks in.<br><br>In modern 3D games, Modulate 2x is often used to apply the lightmaps to the textures...<br><br>Um... actually, my description is a bit off there come to think of it.<br><br>Anyway to continue my thought...  Modulate 2x is used because it not only allows you to darken the textures in shadow areas, but also allows you to brighten them in very light areas, which looks much better than only being able to darken them.  Though you could double the brightness of all your textures before doing a regular multiply pass, the results are ugly because you get flat spots which were too bright in the texture and got clamped to white, but have now had their brightness reduced, and the detail is still gone.  Also it can kill the color saturation depending on how you do the brightening.<br><br>So yeah, I misspoke there.  With the modulate modes what actually happens is any pixel that is less than 127 will darken the underlying image, and any pixel 128 or over will brighten it, up to 2x or 4x.  Actually I'm not certain that in 4x the magic color is still 127, but I'm pretty sure it is. <br><br>So yeah, it's not exactly like add blending a second pass over the object.  It's good for lightmaps though. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
