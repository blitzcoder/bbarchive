WRONG. I got it to a point where you could fly a ship around and chat, so a friend and I tried to stress test it. We both started 10 cilents and connected them to the server... the server started dropping cilents and eventually crashed itself.<br><br>The game I want to make is essentially a 2D version of Freelancer, if anyone has played the Freelancer on multiplayer you'll know exactly what I'm going for... sadly there is very few people who have. Basically, it's a game where each player controls a ship which you can upgrade/sell/buy/fight/travel with directly. This won't be turned based and solar systems will be without bounds. I started it around 2008 as a singleplayer game but since gone on hiatus, I want to return with keeping the general gameplay the same, but multiplayer.<br><br>For the past week I've taken a look around and I found RakNet that seems like a good choice, but it seems like the wrapper is still largely in development still. I've also heard mention of BNetEx, ENet and TNet but I am very weary of trying anything new without recommendation for my specific usage. I also really want feedback on the fesiblity of this endeavor. Is it really going to be too much work to make this game idea into an actual working multiplayer game? Or should I go back to my original single player idea? :S <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
