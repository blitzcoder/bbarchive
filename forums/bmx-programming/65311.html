It seems to me that the language is so powerful, it should be considered an all-purpose programming language, no more specific to writing games than it is to writing, say, office applications.  I think the product has outgrown the "game-making" niche, and it could reach a much wider audience if it were sold to universities and promoted as a flexible and concise OOP programming language.  I've been to conferences where even old DX7 Blitz3D would have been a big hit.  The quality of BR's work is very good, but no one has every heard of their products.  I mean, if I can get my own programs used by universities, I'm sure they would be interested in using BlitzMax.<br><br>BR might want to fill out an application to become a vendor here.  By targetting the channel, you can sell to many schools immediately, rather than approaching each school individually:<br><a href="http://www.academicsuperstore.com/vendor_application" target="_blank">http://www.academicsuperstore.com/vendor_application</a><br><br>Another good resource is www.buy.com.<br><br>Of course, the more BlitzMax users there are, the more resources and libraries I have access to, so that's why I want it to become more standard. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Max is close to C++ in performance and can be made to take up small amounts of resources.<br><br>We have several smaller tasks that require no database connectivity, etc. that could've easily been done in BlitzMax and would probably make more efficient use of resources.<br><br>I think BlitzMax is still too unknown to be "allowed" in most business environments, because most companies will look for something they know they can find other hires to work on, and also most managers like to stick with big names.<br><br>As much as the GUI needs enhancement, BlitzMax needs a standard database API to be accepted by most companies, and that means ODBC or similar.  At that point it'd be a pretty impressive app, cross-platform, good GUI, SQL support, you'd be able to pull in some smaller shops and go from there.<br><br>For what I do, BlitzMax as is now plus a good DB module would be able to cover most of the work I need to do, at which point it'd just be the work of convincing the company to shell out for a licence or ten.<br><br>Another way to get BlitzMax wider coverage would be to get it into some of the emerging markets, such as the mobile apps arena. Developers in emerging markets are more open to using less well known products. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
