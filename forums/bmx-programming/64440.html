If you can send me a test version which doesn't interfere with the main Blide package ( I'm using it to develop with and I can't afford to lose time from work using a beta version for work ) then I would be more than happy to give it a go.<br><br>Unfortunately, I can't send you the project. No disrespect intended, but it's going to be the next two or three years of my life working on this, and it's not just about trusting you ( which I do ) because there are at least two email providers involved between us as well. Anything I can do to test on my machine, just ask. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This version works slow spetially at parsing time, but it should work more or less at the same speed as the 0.7.61 version at edit time. All the parsing is suspended when an application is being run, so it doesn't affect debuging or application runing from within BLIde. You whould be able to use it in your ancient Pentium II, but a Pentium IV is highly recomended. I can't not give you a more acurate information, as I haven't had time to make any serious tests. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
