BlitzMax doesn't seem to allow you to convert anything TO a function pointer. You can cast a function pointer to a byte pointer, and a byte pointer to an int pointer, but it won't allow you to put any kind of pointer in a function pointer.<br><br>So, what I came up with is a way of avoiding the `type` problem and changing the function pointer using memory access. It's easy enough to store the function pointers in a bank's memory by converting them to int pointers and writing them out (with [0] - making sure to write an int using an int ptr!).<br><br>Then to read them back and excecute them, since Blitz won't accept making a function pointer equate to anything other than another function pointer, I get the address of the function pointer itself, an identifier/variable, which actually works using VarPtr(functionname). Then I sneak behind Blitz's back and directly copy the pointer (the temporary function pointer must be a *Global* in memory otherwise this isn't going to work - if it's in a Local register we wouldn't know which register it's in and we wouldn't be able to write to that register  directly) .. I copy the function pointer directly in memory using int ptr's to the function pointer's *address* (location in mem of the function pointer variable), and then simply call the temporary function (which has now been changed to point elsewhere) with any parameters defined.<br><br>It works, but, well, a little bit longwinded and it took quite a lot of messing around to get it right (not Blitz's fault). You have to make absolutely certain that the full integer value of the function pointer is being moved around, plus have to make sure the function pointer is in memory. That's not ideal, since it means it has to be read from ram, written to ram, then accessed from ram again when calling it - Local's would be nicer. But if Blitz would let you cast an int ptr or a byte ptr to a function pointer it would be a lot less work and could go in Local's. I guess you can't have a casting command "Function Ptr()" because the compiler recognizes `Function` as a reserved word that defines a function. Hmmmmm :-) Changeable?<br><br>Anyway, this program works, lets you store function pointers in a bank and execute them from the bank (with a slight interpretation). It might be faster to just use an array of function pointers and access them with funct[i](counter), compared to this `solution`, but hey, banks can be loaded and saved.<br><br><pre class=code>

Rem

Using function pointers to change which function is called dynamically at runtime

With an bank of function pointers. You can convert function pointers into Byte Pointers, but apparently not the reverse.
So instead, I got the address of the function pointer as if it is a variable using VarPtr(), then I sneak behind the
function pointer's type and write its address directly. Then it works.

End Rem

Local myfunctions:TBank=CreateBank(10*4)
Local myfunctionsbuf:Byte Ptr
myfunctionsbuf=BankBuf(myfunctions) 'Address of where function pointers will be stored and retrieved, in a bank

Function funct1(param:Int)
	Print "You're in function 1, passed counter parameter="+param
End Function

Function funct2(param:Int)
	Print "You're in function 2, passed counter parameter="+param
End Function

Local counter:Int
Local offset:Int Ptr=Int Ptr(myfunctionsbuf)
Print "Original functions are at: "+Int(Byte Ptr(funct1))+" "+Int(Byte Ptr(funct2))
For counter=0 To 9 Step 2 'Decide which functions to call
	offset[0]=Int(Byte Ptr(funct1))
	offset[4]=Int(Byte Ptr(funct2))
	offset:+8
Next

Global tempfunct(param:Int) 'Needs to be in memory, not a Local, otherwise can't be remapped!
Local where:Int Ptr=Int Ptr(VarPtr(tempfunct)) 'Need it to be an Int Ptr
offset=Int Ptr(myfunctionsbuf)
For counter=0 To 9
	where[0]=offset[0] 'Copy function-pointer in memory
	'Print "Remapped to: "+where[0]
	tempfunct(counter) 'Call remapped function
	offset:+4

Local funct1()
Local funct2()
Local funct3()
Local funct4()
Local funct5()

'Then use the pointer mem-copy as above to remap these to several specified functions (by number)

'Then call them with:

funct1(); funct2(); funct3(); funct4(); funct5()

</pre><br>The only overhead I see would be 2 mem accesses to handle the `gosub` that is a function call (on powerpc anyway), plus the gosub itself and the final jump back - 4 instructions, compared to 1 instruction with the goto method (given that there are no function parameters). That's not too shabby and would let you hardwire/rewire a sequence of function calls without having to get an array involved. :-D Then the sequence can act like a programmable circuit (albeit the program flow is a little bit diverted). Hey, Mark if you include function inlining in the BlitzMax compiler maybe I won't even need to worry about that ;-)<br><br>Note to self: Maybe use a `functionaddress[]` array to store all the function pointers of the real functions, then just set these dynamic functions to the appropriate numbered function pointer taken from the array - where the number of the array index is taken from a `bytecode` - where bytecodes directly map to corresponding functions. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
