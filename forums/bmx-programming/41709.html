You might think of that as `pure` cross-platform compatibility. Then you're going to have your various degrees of  incompatibility, people wanting to specifically access the Win32 API or specifically write for the Mac Aqua user interface, or perhaps specifically support quicktime or to support only windows media player, etc etc... <br><br>I just wondered as to all your thoughts and opinions about the importance of being fully cross-platform and whether it really matters? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

(yes we bought a mac at a mac store) ... I think it would only be fair to say that Blitz Research wouldn't have put all the time and effort into creating BlitzMax as a cross-platform write-once-compile-anywhere solution only to give up on supporting that cross-platform compatibility by only eventually supporting Windows users. I'm sure there's probably more Windows users than the other two platforms, especially given most previous incarnations of Blitz run under Windows, but I don't think that means everyone will now just migrate to Windows or that BlitzMax will only end up there. Why would Blitz Research go to all these lengths to fulfill this vision only to give up on it. I have a bit more faith in BlitzMax being successful as a development tool for easy cross-platform deployment as well as for achieving great results on any of the given platforms.<br><br>And it would be great to see it even migrate to other platforms in future as well, to the Amiga perhaps, Acorn, BeOS, etc. It's definitely a big selling point for BlitzMax that it makes it so easy to get your creations out to a wider audience, and maybe it is even doing a service to mankind by trying to get people to let down their guards a little and act like we're all part of the same human race. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Obviously there's nothing you can't do with it right now, but you have to code a lot of hard bits yourself.  People will eventually fill in the gaps here and there and eventually you'll find a good, vast array of modules written for a lot of things, some of them will be OS specific, some of them cross-platform.  So basically I don't think it matters.  People will have their preferences as to which direction they want to take, as they should.  I'd personally like to see mostly cross platform stuff worked on by people for now, which is what is happenning for the most part anyway.  So that's good.  It's all good.

You can see PC gaming moving in that direction as well in a number of stores. The console sections grow while the PC section shrinks.
