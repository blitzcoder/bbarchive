Maybe SyncMods could even offer to look for this when we update?<br><br>- I am going to pore over the tutorials for BMax (some really good ones in there) to bring up my 'expertise' level so that perhaps I can contribute something worthwhile. I have written a User's Guide, but it is unfinished. Perhaps I will be able to finish it after this... (I like to be able to 'wrap my brain completely around something' before I try to convey it to someone else: The whys and hows make the logic so much easier to grasp to a new user). <br><br>- This documentation, whatever form it eventually takes, MUST (IMHO) assume <b>NO</b> prior Blitz knowledge, at least in the User Guide.

The docs were awful and kinda looked a lot like Bmax's today.<br>I decided that the quickest way for me was to completely gut the online docs and fix typos and mistakes and reformat everything into something I could ring bind and have open in my lap when needed.

Why are the docs for BMAX so horrible?  My guess would be that Mark and company, like most programmers, find the tedium of documentation the least desirable thing they could spend their time on.

Why it has neither of these is a mystery to me.  I think Mark has made stellar products but really missed realizing the full potential of his efforts.  <br><br>My last supervisor had a very good mantra which I fully adhere to in my professional life.

Docs is not the most fun part of application development, so it was never done. New features and bug fixes was what the time went to, and still does. And as long as BRL do not desperately need more $$$ they have no reason to make Blitzmax more appealing to more people (like beginners or improving the information about blitzmax at sales), there is still plenty of b3d users who do not have max, and many of them will likely get it once the 3D module it out. By then BRL could keep working on new ideas, and the need to improve the documentation will be last priority again. <br><br>They have done a few things to lessen the burden on the docs.<br>1. open source<br>2. A tutorial forum<br>3. A link to the wiki.<br>I think it is a bit sad that this is where it seems to end.<br><br>I can not know if there is any truth in my story above, I'm only assuming something like that is the case, or what do you think? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Sure OOP isn't a silver bulet, but that shouldn't mean we should dismiss it. Abstaction is a tool to handle complexity, thus a more abstract language will allow you to create more complex things in less time. It's not a matter of what you can do, it's a matter of how much time it saves (productivity you gain), not only during development, but in maintenance aswell.<br><br><div class="quote"> You keep saying early adopter. I bought Max when it was in beta. It has been one and a half years. Max is awell past the early adopter stage. <br></div>No it isn't. Being an early adopter is not about how long ago you bought the product. Being an early adopter is about having a whole product and mainstream market leadership. BRL have neither, thus their current customers are early adopters as defined by the technology adaption life-cycle.<br><br><div class="quote"> Potential customers won't be. <br></div>Yes they will. You'll never run out of <b>potential</b> customers.<br><br><div class="quote"> I fully believe that if BMAX had professional docs and dash of marketing it could quite easily become very maintsteam, used by schools and pro's alike. <br></div>A mainstream product requires a lot more than documentation and marketing (I assume you mean promotion). First of all, it needs a whole product, BlitzMAX is not. It doesn't have any strategic partners that could provide useful 3rd party software integration (like Photoshop, 3DS Max, Eclipse/CodeWarrior, Z-Brush, Subversion/CVS) and they don't seem to be working on these themselves.<br><br>Secondly they don't solve any mainstream market pains, and thus does not present the potential customer with a compelling reason to buy.<br><br>But lastly and most importantly, they do not have the third ingredient, market leadership either. They don't even seem to have a distinct target market segment for their products, other than wierd and wonderful people. It doesn't matter much at this point which market segment they chose to dominate, the Academic market segment or the Indie Developer market segment. What matters is they establish leadership quickly and unquestionably, and they put it in bold writing on the front page of the website. <br><br><div class="quote"> I can not know if there is any truth in my story above, I'm only assuming something like that is the case, or what do you think? <br></div>Well the train of thought is probably fairly accurate, but the reasoning is probably a little off. Until the 3D module is out, and BlitzMAX as technology is feature complete, there doesn't seem to be much point in spending much time on documentation, that is still very likely to change in the mean time. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
