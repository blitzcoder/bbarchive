There could be something in your code causing the graphics card to work harder than it really should be, like generating a lot of textures regularly (not sure but text could be causing this, have never gone poking into the drawtext command internally...). OpenGL does a lot of work on a mac as the whole OS GUI is run through it.<br><br>Texture space overloading: the graphics getting loaded to the graphics card may be overloading the vram and rather than caching and paging, for some reason (heat?) it's just refusing to generate the texture properly when requested. A likely cause of this based on people fixing it with a restart of the app, and it tending to occur after running for a while would be a glitch in the garbage collector causing textures to not fully be released or dealloced properly. Did you compile with multithreading on? the MT garbage collector is all kinds of broken in my experience...<br><br>Driver glitch: apple updates their drivers at odd intervals and it will only affect some cards on some systems when they do. e.g. they may update the driver for mid 2009 mac minis which is an nvidia geforce, but they might not update the mac pro 2009 with an nvidia card driver... generally they release nvidia or ati updates for all systems but not always. Most people don't look at the updates list when they come they just say go, so they may not be aware they recently updated the drivers, or the drivers might have been burried in with a bigger OS update. or they might NOT have updated to a driver that fixes a problem...<br><br>Once other thing you could try, if you're building the windows version for direct x, try switching to the opengl driver there and see what happens. If you get similar problems you're likely making openGL mad somehow (garbage collector is my guess, or as was mentioned above it could be a font rendering issue...). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
