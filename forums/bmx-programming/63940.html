At this point, if someone wrote the entire transition code for you, it would be no use to you. You really need to either read the tutorials through slowly and carefully or just find something simpler. I know this probably seems simple after using a program which did all the hard work for you, but it's not all that simple for a beginner. It requires an understanding of program flow and control that you likely won't have yet.<br><br>If you *REALLY* don't want to read the tutorials Perturbatio just posted, then go simpler. I know I learn better with a task ahead of me, then I have specific requirements and I learn them. For instance, you're not learning boring variables because the tutorial says they're important, you're learning them because it lets you do what you're trying to do. There's probably a fancy name for it, but I just think of it as solution-oriented learning as opposed to feature-oriented learning. You can only try, you may find it motivates you to learn more, as it does with me.<br><br>It's hard to say without knowing your skill level in more detail, but at this point, I'd say a good starting point would be to learn how to write a program that does this :<br><br>1) Opens a graphics window.<br>2) Loads a 32x32 Image ( can be anything. A square, a circle )<br>3) Moves the image around the screen when you press the cursor keys.<br>4) Stops the image from going off the edge of the screen.<br>5) Closes when you press the escape key.<br><br>This will give you a very basic understanding of variables, graphics and program flow, and because it's so basic, if you can't do one part of it, and someone shows you how, there's a good chance you'll learn from it.<br><br>I honestly don't think the transitions thing is going to help you learn anything right now. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You are now working with a real programming language, not a one-purpose tool like that game creator that you mentioned. <br><br>In other words: There won´t be a way around the "boring" stuff like "what´s a variable", "where are my things stored", "what´s a #?!$$§ control structure", "what´s a function", "what´s a method", "what´s a class" and "what´s the logic behind all this". You have to be willing to learn how things work, and you won´t get there in a few hours or days. This can be VERY frustrating, so better ask yourself if learning programming is really what you want to do. <br><br>And one other general advice: People here (or in any other forum) will not write your code for you, and it will also not get you anywhere if others are doing the job for you. Think about an approach first, write some code, and when you get stuck and -REALLY- do not know how to go on, post the code you are fighting with and somebody will probably help you fix it. But don´t expect anybody to write something for you from scratch. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You'll need that passion to help you force through all the boring crap like reading tutorials and doing really simple stuff that you could do in your sleep with RPG Maker. There's no getting around it though. If you don't do the fundamentals, you simply won't understand the explanations and assistance given when you ask wider-ranging questions like the transitions thing. Believe me, I've seen people who have been at it for months, maybe a year or more, and they still don't have the basic grasp of variables and program flow, because they avoided the fundamentals and tried to get ahead of themselves, asking specific questions and then cobbling together programs from chunks of code given to them by helpful forum members.

Everyone finds their own level, if they stick at it long enough. For my part, I'm a very pragmatic person. If someone has already written something which ( essentially ) does what I want, then I'll likely use it rather than waste time writing my own. If the existing solutions to a problem are not to my taste, I'll write my own. Others will almost always write their own version of everything, as a matter of pride, or of having things exactly how they want, or whatever. Still others will almost always stick to existing solutions because they don't feel comfortable writing libraries or engines, and they like to rely on other people's solutions, believing them to be more reliable.<br><br>When you've got to the stage where you're comfortable with many or most of BlitzMax's language features and all the commonly used BRL modules, you'll either find yourself feeling a bit more adventurous and keen to learn and develop your skills, or you'll find yourself keen to keep working at the level you're at. BlitzMax comes with a good selection of modules and there are many more good ones out there for free too. If you did want to write your own ( I assume RPG? ) engine, then an awful lot of the low level stuff has been done for you. You could plug XML-file functions, reading from and writing to Zip files, BlitzMax's OpenGL and DX7 2d engines, etc, etc into a game engine of your own design very easily, and you'd really be left with just the core game engine, without touching the lower level stuff.<br><br>You may well find that a lot of fun. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
