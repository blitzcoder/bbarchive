Either way it's lazy and the values should be pushed onto a stack or other data structure so that you are only iterating over the number of keys that you have... Another possibility to make it faster still would be to use some flag for "anykeyhit" but I'm not sure what that would be, probably the event hook method above would be best... the combination of that and putting them into a stack as they are bound will probably make it very fast.<br><br>Initially I wrote this for key handling in my simple GUI so I wasn't that concerned about speed.  I am very interested in the branch prediction question...

You should also <b>never listen to anyone</b> (especially me) on this topic; because it's a hidden factor, the only way to know for sure whether your program is affected by it and where is to use a profiling tool like Intel VTune.<br><br>Prediction is (on ~2000 - ~2010 archs) usually one level deep (the last function pointer called will be predicted to be called again). On newer systems it is often two levels deep (obviously not for control structures since they only describe two paths). Either way, on production CPUs it is <i>extremely</i> simplistic and <i>does not</i> take data into account: it isn't able to see "this is iteration 58, where we branched true previous loop"; it is able to see only which path <i>was</i> taken on iteration 57. Counter-intuitively, i the case of function pointers, it's also <i>not</i> able to look at the actual register about to be called through and see what function pointer is really loaded there. While more advanced algorithms are possible in theory (and have been built in practice), they're too complicated to be worth the effort, either physically or because the actual prediction ends up taking too long. (<a href="http://www.microarch.org/micro36/html/pdf/jimenez-FastPath.pdf" target="_blank">They can be very interesting though.</a>)<br><br>(Also, ret instructions have a near-100% accuracy rate because they <i>do</i> take data into account and maintain a separate prediction stack, due to their importance)<br><br>Therefore you will have a misprediction at both the If for pointers that need to be called through, and at the call itself if it's not the same call as last time. You may as well lose the secondary If and use some kind of And operation instead for that, so it doesn't need a second branch.<br><br>You could achieve near-perfect prediction by unrolling the loop and replacing the false branch of the "If" with calls to a dummy function that does nothing, although this is a dumb idea for several reasons (reason 1 being that it makes your code look horrible; it's probably also much slower than sucking up the odd mispredict thanks to the tremendous bloat, unless you severely limited the number of bindings. Actually wait, you <i>could</i> limit the size of it quite severely since only a few keyhits can actually be returned each frame...).<br><br>In practice I'd be surprised if a loop of a mere 256 elements was slow enough to measurably affect <i>anything</i> at the top level of the main loop, even if it mispredicted on every single branch. Neither mispredicts nor the loop itself are going to be your bottlenecks here.<br><br><br>@post #2: function pointers are <i>awesome</i>.

You can cast between the different pointer and integer types freely, you can add and subtract integers to/from pointers, and in addition pointers can be subscripted to dereference them. There is no dedicated deref operator, but subscripting the 0th element is the same thing.<br><br>Pointer arithmetic is as in C: adding to a pointer of type `T Ptr` adds `sizeof(T)` to its underlying address value. Subscripting is <i>exactly</i> as in C: <br><br><pre class=code>Local p:Int Ptr = ...
p[5]  ==  (p + 5)[0]  ==  (Byte Ptr(p) + 5 * sizeof(Int))[0]

Local d:Int Ptr = Int Ptr(MemAlloc(SizeOf(0) * 2))

This relies completely on assumptions about the underlying representation (that will change if the 64-bit compiler gets off the ground) - just because pointers happen to be represented as ints doesn't mean they actually are ints, conceptually<br><br>-- you can get "raw" data blocks to play with using MemAlloc and MemFree, analogous to malloc and free (not the same and not compatible though - if you manipulate data from a C library, do not free it with MemFree or vice versa)<br><br>-- casting an object to Byte Ptr gives you the address of the start of the <i>data contained in the object</i> (e.g. if you had a simple type with fields x%, y%, z%, then casting an object to Byte Ptr would give you the address of x). This is <i>not the same</i> as the value BlitzMax uses as a typed object reference in normal code; that's another hidden implementation detail (it's ptr - 8 in the current compiler, but this <i>will</i> change) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You could also have it keep a running histogram of keys hit and sort the list in order of hit frequency.<br><br> These methods would drastically increase speed in most common use situations, unless you are writing a word processor or something where semi random key hits over a large space was common for some reason.<br><br>Check key last hit first, then most frequent key, then last 8 keys, then down the frequencies, then on to the more obscure keys. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
