That way you could also do `hardware scrolling` where you can move the entire visible display without having to copy-paste any data whatsoever - given that the backbuffer is preserved, of course.<br><br>These days you have the slight limitation that the backbuffer is not allowed to be any bigger than the display resolution. So for a 1024x768 display your buffer has to be that size as well - not particularly helpful for keeping track of a per-pixel destructible terrain several screens wide. <br><br>You are allowed, hardware dependent, to have textures which are larger than the backbuffer - on some systems it could even by 2048, 4096, or even higher maximum width of the texture, which may be plenty for a reasonably sized destructible terrain. What that then means is simply that you draw the entire thing and let the hardware crop it for you to the visible display. The only problem then is how to modify the texture - either copying it to the backbuffer and changing it and then copying back to the texture - which is possible with OpenGL 1.1 commands e.g. glCopyTexSubImage2D is reasonably quick to copy a dirty-rectangle from the backbuffer to the texture. If your hardware doesn't support textures as big as you'd like you can use multiple textures and just split up the copy operations if they go over the texture boundaries.<br><br>Another way is to use the tilemaps as mentioned above, whereby you define, say, textures of a given size like 64x64 or 256x256, you assemble a large tilemap, and then when you need to modify an area of the landscape you just need to lock one tile (or a few), modify them, and then unlock them to reupload the changed pixmaps to their respective textures. Not exactly the fastest way to do it because the data has to upload over the graphics bus each time, but if the tiles are small it may not be enough to cause a problem. That's basically the same as having an off-line super-pixmap in main memory, which you modify, and then just upload the changed areas to textures in video ram.<br><br>If you wanted to get more advanced, for example, you could use OpenGL extensions, use the framebuffer objects if supported, which lets you define a new render target as a texture, which would be up to the maximum texture size, and then you can just render directly to the texture and then turn the framebuffer object into the `backbuffer` and flip it for display. Minimal copying needed.<br><br>Personally I think that you can't trust the maximum texture size being supported on all machines, and should count on needing to define multiple textures/images as a kind of tilemap with large tiles. Then set about whatever preferred method you have for modifying the contents of the respective textures, either copying them to the backbuffer and modifying them and copying them back, or modifying their source pixmaps in main memory and reuploading the texture, or whatever.<br><br>Besides how to store and refresh and draw the landscape, you probably also need to think about how to generate the landscape image, and you also need to think about how it is going to behave. Is it going to simple be a kind of heightmap where each column is a solid column of pixels up to a given row on the screen (ie no overhanging landscape areas), or are you going to allow overhang? Also when something blows up are you going to leave pieces of land floating in the sky or are you going to make them fall? If they fall, how do they interact with the land they fall onto? Do they filter down like grains of sand? Do they fall as columns and rest when the column touches the ground beneath? Do you try to do this in realtime or between turns? Do you use physics? Do you fake the physics or do a realistic simulation? etc<br><br>Generating the landscape image itself is not too difficult once you've decided what kind of land mechanics you are going to simulate. You probably want to think from an artistic/design point of view what kind of control you want the game to have over the kind of landscapes that get generated - is it going to be like worms where you have to hand-draw the land and load it later as an image? Are you going to create a generator? Worms had you basically drawing with a large circle and then it would sort of decorate the results for you by adding grass surfaces and shaded layers of earth, etc. Are you going to auto-generate landscapes? How are you going to do that and give yourself enough control to exploit it in the game - e.g. cliffs, hills, flatlands, slopes, etc?<br><br>I've thought about this stuff quite a bit because it's one of the kind of `game engines` that I'm working on. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

My first attempt was a simple "move one pixel up, down, or right until you get to the other side of the screen" procedure that, obviously, generated completely unacceptable results. Next, I adapted a terrain generator from a Java project I found on the web, and it works, but it works slowly and I am not satisfied with the resulting terrain.

Well, great, but that's a bit vague.<br><br>Ideally, I would like terrain with protrusions that can curve forward or backward, overhangs, the whole nine yards. I have been unable to find useful information on how to achieve this. I've considered pre-made terrain shapes, which could be planted on a generated horizon to add features. I have also considered a negative version of the above: libraries of shapes that could be randomly applied to cut out chunks of terrain. Naturally, I would probably use a combination of the above.<br><br>Do you have any input on the above methods, or suggestions for other things I could investigate?

It's important to think about it because the way you handle the falling of land parts (if at all) is closely linked to the kind of landscapes you can generate. You can't generate overhanging parts if you don't also find a way to deal with or explain what happens when an overhang is sevvered from its supporting structure. Overhangs are a lot trickier to deal with than to simply make the land `fall vertically`.<br><br>The easiest landscape physics to code is simply none at all, which quite accurately explains the Worms games. One of the reasons (I think) that worms had tunnels and floating land parts is because the author did not know how to deal with making the dislodged land fall and settle. That said, if you do want to have tunnels which cut right through a hill without the hill above collapsing it, then you are basically saying that land never falls at all. Also floating land parts allow you to do things like swing from ropes like a ninja, grappled onto some floating lump.<br><br>If those are the kind of `features` that you want, then you probably don't care about making the landscape fall in any even barely realistic manner. But if you do want it to fall, such as in Scorched Tanks/Earth, then now you're getting into different territory. You need a way to detect the disconnected landscape parts (e.g. anything `above` the explosion area). If you are detecting the columns above an explosion then all pixels in those columns need to fall until they touch another pixel below. That's one way. You could conceivably give your landscape overhangs which would suddenly turn into separate columns when it gets cuts off.  Then you might want to consider whether you want the dislodged land to have any particulate effects - does it fall like grians of sand and pile up on the floor? Do you get landslides? Do you process real physics interactions or fake it? etc.<br><br>But anyway. As to generating landscape images, I've seen a lot of different approaches. Atomic Tanks has a pretty nice looking landscape generator with different levels of substrate, although there are no overhangs.<br><br>You should ask yourself how you want to generate the landscapes and whether you want the user to generate them, and if so with what kind of tools? The midpoint binary subdivision works pretty nice for basic landscapes but not with any overhanging features or tunnels. Are you aiming to provide a level editor? How would the user edit the landscape? How will you render the landscape and take some of the work out of it for the user?<br><br>The thing I like about the midpoint method is you can start off with a `rough` landscape design based on some parameters - eg fairly flat, fairly random, more cliffy, etc, and then subdivide it to make it look landscapeish. The user could adjust the points on the landscape at any of the levels of subdivision to modify it, and it's pretty easy to generate it randomly.<br><br>I've seen some games that use splines to create the landscape (e.g. Charr on the Amiga). You could use other graphics techniques. Your idea of using predefined landscape cookie-cutters is not bad, actually, you could approximately detect the edges of a rough land shape and cut out from it using randomized masks.

There isn't really any limit to how your land `looks`, if it's a part of the style of your game. For all anyone cares you could just use a randon number between 400 and 500 for the ground level of each vertical column. It'd give very spiky land. If that works for you, then hey. You could make it with rectangles, splines, ovals, premade shapes, fractals, whatever, or even go with the hand-drawn bitmap approach.<br><br>Have you decided how large your landscape will be? Will it require scrolling? How will you do the scrolling/tiling/update? Does your land wrap around at the edges or do you deal with bouncy screen limits or just let stuff go out of play? Have you thought about weather effects?<br><br>I guess if you're going with pieces of land overhanging and remaining floating in the air - one thing worms did was to have a `dark` land image which would appear where there used to be bright land foreground, so you cut a crater hole and replace it with dark/black pixels where it overlapped the land, making it look like the land still `supports` the stuff above it, like there's still some land `further back` away from the main playfield holding it up. That's one way to do it, or just blow all the way through to create sky. If you go this route then you don't need to think about making the land fall or anything. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I am thinking something like 2048x768, but that's just a planning number and subject to change. As for the scrolling and tiling, I am considering rendering the land to a bitmap, then loading the bitmap as an animated image strip and using a simple tilemap engine. If I make each tile 64x64 using the dimensions listed above, I'd only be looking at around 384 tiles. In some of the projects I've goofed with, I've had no trouble with tile maps of 10,000+ tiles. As it sits in my head, I have been envisioning the land just ending in limbo on either side, although scrolling around would allow for amusing "shoot left to hit guys on the right" scenarios. I do not intend to have bouncy walls or any kind of borders, but again... nothing is set in stone.<br><br>I may or may not bother with some sort of underlying texture for the land. I don't think the hovering land detracts from the enjoyment of the game, but I suppose I could be wrong. When playing BnGs on Worms, I always kind of liked the obstacles that could be created by the hovering landscape bits.<br><br>Thanks for the thoughtful replies and questions.

Image data for karaoke graphics is stored as bit-flags, so you have to perform pixel-level manipulation.

Since I envision this as a turn-based game, there shouldn't be an issue with multiple explosions causing mass damage all over the map. Also, I intend to make the damage areas generally circle-shaped, so I can just find all pixels within the blast radius and take care of those.<br><br>SpaceAce <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
