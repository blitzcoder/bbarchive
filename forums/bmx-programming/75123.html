When you optimize code, you target the parts of your code that take a large amount of time to execute, especially when it's executed repeatedly and will drag overall performance down.  You do not, however, optimize a string, when it is fine as-is and does not impact your program's speed at all.<br><br>Starting out trying to write the most optimized code will just result in your working on a single function that does close to nothing, until finally you've either written it in C, ASM, or given up.  The point is to make progress, not to write the absolute most efficient code right away.  If you try to do that, you're just being stupid and ignoring the fact that you need to get everything working before you can really know what needs to be optimized. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I tend to prefer quality over quantity and that means the time is not important.<br><br>As to making code slower, obviously that would only be the case when you have not finished optimizing properly.

However, realistically there is <i>always</i> some point where you decide "okay this is fast enough, now to move on to the next task" (otherwise you would literally spend forever just trying to get "Hello World" to run faster.)  That point is precisely what you described, when you are satisfied with how it works, and should probably be sometime well before you start optimizing strings.<br><br>As an even clearer example of silly optimizing, think about floating point math.  Sure it would run fractionally faster if you always replaced all of your floating point math with integers, but do you optimize the routine every time you multiply a couple of numbers together?  (If you do then I suppose this really is just a difference of opinion and it's not like anyone is going to convince you.)<br><br>That all said, I think everyone has something where they know in their head it doesn't really matter but they obsess about it anyway.  In my case, I'm constantly fretting about if there's a more efficient way to setup my if/else statements.  I know this makes essentially no difference, but I'm constantly fiddling in order to minimize the number of condition checks the computer needs to make.  Silly but that's just a nervous habit of mine. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
