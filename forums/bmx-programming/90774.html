</textarea><br><br>The only real difference between my game and the sample program I wrote is that my game uses SetOrigin() to move the camera.

Also, to make sure SetOrigin() doesn't break CollideImage(), I tried adding an origin the same way, in the sample code.<br><br>No other methods or functions does a call to either ResetCollisions(), SetOrigin() or CollideImage() than those that should, and they do it like they do in the sample code.<br><br>Honestly, I really don't understand why this doesn't work. Does anyone have any ideas?<br><br>I could attach the project, but the project is kind of big, going on for a few thousand lines of code, and it's divided into 22 files, etc, so it would take a while just to get into the project, and therefore I won't do that unless someone specifically asks for it.<br><br>Any help at all will be greatly appreciated!<br><br>Regards,<br>Anthony <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It will probably be very very slow if we go through all of these tiles each frame. And even if I would only check for collisions on the visible tiles (I actually only draw the visible tiles, so that shouldn't be a problem to accomplish), there is still a potential of there being about 1900 tiles on the screen at any given point of time (since all tiles are 16x16 in size, and the screen resolution is 800x600). Doing that 1900 times each frame will KILL the frame rate. So I need a collision layer instead, and it needs to be pixel perfect, so I cannot only use a tilebased collision layer. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I just thought of something though. I could use ImagesCollide() if I only check the 8 tiles that surround the player, at any given point in time.
</pre><br>I would consider that a given. I doubt you would have to check all 8 tiles at a given time either. for example on a side scroler with gravity; when walking I would only check the one below, the one in front, and the one in front below in the direction of walk etc... also for imagesCollide the larger the tiles are the longer it takes to check sense I believe it does a per pixel sweep on on top of that you would have to do a movement sweep if your object moves more than one pixel at a time to make sure you don't go past the collision point. <br>I tried ImagesCollide with a shooter I was doing and when I checked collision for sprites about 128x128 and about 8 16x16 sprites, speed did take very noticeable hit on my 3 years old dual core 2ghz laptop with Intel Graphics. <br>to solve this problem some games use hardcoded behavior for certain tiles pertaining to slopes. there are tutorials in the internet that illustrate that(or at least there were. years sense I last searched this subject).<br><br>[edit]<br>here is one tutorial:<br><a href="http://jnrdev.72dpiarmy.com/en/jnrdev2/" target="_blank">http://jnrdev.72dpiarmy.com/en/jnrdev2/</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
