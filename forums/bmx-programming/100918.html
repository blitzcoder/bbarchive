I'm wondering if there's anything I need to know about compiling and what happens when the compiled app is run, for example, on different versions of Mac OS X.<br><br>I'm making my app on Leopard 10.5 but wondering if maybe I should upgrade to Lion? I sent a simple program to a friend and he sent back this note which seems to imply some confusion over intel macs, classic, and the versions of OS X. What, exactly, does Blitz compile for? My friend seems to think Blitz is compiling for classic apps only?<br><br>Here's his note. Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated! My project could die an early death if I don't get this straightened out.<br>Thanks,  -Rob<br><br>Friends note trying to run my app:<br><br><br>So the problem with the Mac version is that it targets the old Mac classic build architecture. 10.6 Snow Leapord (all version previous to 10.6 are natively capable of running classic apps) contained a piece of software called "Rosetta" which was essentially a classic emulator that would allow it to run classic applications. Apple removed Rosetta from 10.7 so classic applications no longer work on 10.7 and newer. <br><br>So after I changed the extension to .app, I went to get info and it shows 'Kind:' and "Application (Classic)" so I am 99.9% sure that this is the issue.<br><br>If you still have the source code and project you should be able to rebuild it using a newer build target (assuming your developer environment is moderately up to date) - it will probably say "Intel" or "x86" or something like that. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Now what I can tell you is that I'm 99.5% sure that what's happening is blitzmax is building a PPC compatible binary (for whatever reason). It's not a question of hardware - in fact hardware is irrelevant in this case.<br><br> Because you have 10.5 which supports classic ppc (note that it also supports intel native binaries) applications you're able to run the binary (since it's built to be ppc compatable). The 64bit/32bit thing is definitely not an issue at all in the case (unless the setting on your compiler is somehow causing it to push out a PPC build). <br><br> Long story short 10.5 (and 10.6 with the Rosetta plugin installed) will run certain PPC applications, it has nothing to do with whether you have intel or ppc hardware. <br><br>So I would expect that you would be able to run it, if I installed 10.5 on my intel mac I would be able to run it too. 10.7+ is able to read the binary and determine that it's targeting an architecture (PPC) that's no longer supported by 10.7+ and thus is incapable of running it."<br><br><br><br>So its possible that apps made with 10.5 and 10.6 might not work on 10.7 and above.<br><br>I'm not sure about Blitz and Lion. If it can work, and run on 10.7 and above, that would be better as most people are probably doing Lion anyway, rather than the other way around. 10.5 and 10.6 will likely go out soon enough.<br><br>Are there coders here on Lion and is Blitz ok with it?
