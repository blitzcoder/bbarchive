C++ or even better C# experience (as BM is managed so managed references, not long pointer hick hack) will help you quite a little when learning BM.<br><br>Don't think there is a comparision table as it would be a little desturbing to see that most stuff in detail works different than C / C++. (you can't use pointer + x to iterate through arrays as they are true objects for example and things like that)<br><br>But to give some you some general informations to compare:<br><br>Numerics in BM are by value. They are no objects. If you need to change them, you can declare them as variable:int VAR in the function header.<br><br>Everything else beside numerics (including array and string) are objects. They are always managed reference and given to functions by reference.<br>There is no delete keyword like in C++ (but there is a new), the GC will free them themself if they are not referenced anymore. But be aware that BM has no root link reference counter like C# so cyclic referencing will prevent the whole cycle from beeing freed!<br><br><br><br>That are the basic difference with large impact between BM and C++ I think.<br>The rest like no overloading, no real constructors (beside new() ) and some specific inheritance behaviors (as well as no multiple inheritance) normally do not have such a worse impact in general situations. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
