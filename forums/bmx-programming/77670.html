Each letter is a sprite attached to the text object's pivot, and any animation which can be applied to a sprite can be applied to those letter sprites in that pivot's space.<br># Create scrolling planes and backgrounds<br># Align objects on screen, independent from current screen resolution!<br># Natural looking movements, scaling, rotating using 5 different easing methods!  (I'm not sure it's even possible to ease things 16 different ways, but two of mine are exponential and you can modify the exponent so really there's an infinite number of easing methods in my system if you want to get technical.)<br># NEW: Now including a lightning-fast GUI to create 3D-accelerated windows and gadgets!<br># Complete, detailed in-code documentation - each command explained!<br># Several simple, easy-to-read code samples.<br> <br></div><br><br><br>And some stuff my system does which Sprite Candy doesn't seem to support:<br><br>* Move sprites along paths.<br>* Parent any sprite or path to any other sprite and they will move with them and change properties with them.<br>* Set which properties change with the parent, so change position, but not rotation to create a sprite which orbits a parent as the parent rotates, but remains facing up.<br>* Hide a parent, and children are hidden.  Show a parent, and children which are currently set to be visible appear, but hidden children retain their hidden state. (This is better than what Blitz 3D does.)<br>* Animate a parent's properties and the children animate those properties as well.<br>* "Fog" sprites to varying degrees, turning them white, or black or any other color, for fog effects or glow effects.<br>* "Glow" sprites, making them up to 2x normal brightness by simply adjusting one or more of their color channels above 255,255,255.<br>* Make your game run at any resolution, with letterboxing if neccessary.<br>* Super easy to use and powerful command set.<br>* Animations can be controlled in every way imaginable.  Delay the start of an animation.  Offset the animation in time when triggered. (Imagine you have a line of letters you want to move in a sine wave.  Give all the same looping Y sine animation except offset the starting age of each, and the letters will start at different heights.)  Play an animation backwards.  Loop it.  Play it once.  Play it once forwards and then backwards.  And then loop that as well if desired.<br><br><br>I can't possibly list all the features here, but if you check out the links in my sig there's lists of all the functions and more information.<br><br><br>Basically, my system is designed for non-gui heavy games.  It's designed for your standard shareware game, with basic animated menus and animated text effects.  It's not designed for displaying tons of text in scrollable windows, and it doesn't have built in menu creation stuff, because who knows how you want to animate your menus, or your buttons?  Maybe you want a glow sprite applied over a button when the user mouses over it?  Maybe you want that to play a sound?  Maybe you want the button to fly off the screen when clicked?  Maybe you want that to play a sound as well?  Maybe you want it to rotate back and forth or shake when the mouse is over it?  There's so many things you might want to do that the only way to let you do all that is so just treat menus the same as everything else and provide the basic mouse functions needed to tell when the mouse is over those sprites.<br><br>So unless you are making an RPG and need tons of text, my sort of system is probably better, and definitely more flexible. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Stick it out with Blitzmax for my 2d projects or make the move to B3D/Sprite Candy right now. eeek... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
