Here is what has been updated:<br><br><br>1. You can now give sprites drop shadows!  <br><br>The system does not require any special images to be loaded for this to work.  You can specify the distance and angle of the shadow, or use a vector if you desire.  One command, you have a shadow.  Direction and distance can be set per sprite, so you could reduce the distance when a button is pushed down to give the impression that the button is moving in the Z axis.  Shadows will become more transparent as the object that is casting them becomes more transparent as well.<br><br><br>2. You can now make sprites up to 2x brighter by setting color values over 255.  This is done via add blending.<br><br><br>3. The system now gives you TFormPoint, TFormVector, and TFormNormal functions which act like 2D versions of the Blitz3D functions.  They allow you to transform points and vectors from the space of one sprite to another (or global space).  The shadow function uses TFormVector to determine where to draw the shadow for example.<br><br><br>Older sprite system info can be found here:<br><a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=58037" target="_blank">http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=58037</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

For example, Zsprite has lots of documentation and <br>demos, but my system is much easier to use.  <br><br>Here are some other reasons to choose my system over Zsprite:<br><br><br><br>Creating sprites:<br>-----------------<br><br>With Zsprite, you have to call a special function to load your images, which it calls "resources".  You then have to <br>create a set of "layers".  Each "layer" can only have one type of sprite in it.  Once you've done that, you can add <br>sprites to the appropriate layers.  Then if you want to change the order of stuff around you've got all these functions<br>for swapping layers and moving them to the front or back.  <br><br>Does that sound simple to you?<br><br>My system is much simpler.  With my system you just load images like you normally would.  Then you create sprites, and <br>set the order they should draw in.  Easy peasy.<br><br><br><br>Collisions:<br>-----------<br><br>With Zsprite, you literally have 15 different functions for determining collisions.  Why so many?  I have no idea.<br><br>With my system you have two collision functions:  Pixel perfect sprite vs sprite, and pixel perfect sprite vs rect.  <br>I coded an entire game for Lego using just these two collision functions and they served me quite well.  <br><br>ZSprite does have the ability to call a function when a collision is detected automatically, and that's a useful feature.  <br>So it gets a point there, but I wouldn't be surprised if I implement a similar feature in my own system in the not too <br>distant future. :-)<br><br><br><br>Updating:<br>---------<br><br>With Zsprite, you have to zsSystenBegin and zsSystemEnd at the beginning and end of your main loop AND call the update <br>function in the middle.<br><br>With my system you only have to call the functon to update the animation, and draw the sprites.<br><br>Also, with my system you specify the time which has passed.  With ZSprite, I don't see a time passed parameter which you<br>pass to the update function, so I have to assume it is using millisecs to keep track of time itself.  While this might <br>make things simpler initially, it doesn't make them much simpler, and you will probably find that you need to be able to <br>slow down or pause the animation of the sprites at some point.  What if you alt-tab out of your app?  Time, or in this <br>case, millisecs(), waits for no one!  With my system you can detect those conditions and skip adding time to the game <br>timer when the frame time was over a second.  With ZSprite, you're out of luck.<br><br><br><br>Effects:<br>--------<br><br>ZSprite has lots of effects.  It has some my system doesn't.  Like making a sprite blink, or shake.    <br><br>But my system also has lots of effects.  Like the ability to move sprites along a path, or make them move in a sine wave <br>pattern.  Or make them move from one place to another with acceleration and deceleration.<br><br>And my system allows you to make ANY effect play one-shot, looped, or ping pong, in both forward and reverse. <br><br>ZSprite on the other hand only allows one-shot loop and ping pong with frame animation, and does not support playing <br>animations in reverse.  Most if not all of the other effects it has support only one-shot animation.<br><br>Wouldn't you trade the ability to shake a sprite for the ability to play animations in reverse, and the ability to <br>continuously animate almost any sprite property?<br><br><br>My function names also make more sense.  Compare "zsEffectRotateTo" to "Animate.Rotation" for example.<br><br><br><br>Single surface rendering:<br>-------------------------<br><br>Sounds nice on paper, but is unlikely to speed up most sprite based games, and requires you to deal with nasty things <br>like resources and layers and "preparing open gl contexts".<br><br><br><br>Fonts:<br>------<br><br>No font support in my system yet, but there will be, and you'll probably be able to animate the individual letters in <br>neat ways.<br><br><br><br>"Geometry Objects":<br>-------------------<br><br>A fancy term for 2D polygons.  Are polygons all that useful in a 2D game?  Perhaps in a few limited scenarios, but <br>otherwise, not really.<br><br><br><br><br>Now let's talk about what my system does that ZSprite doesn't do:<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Create paths for moving sprites along.  Move sprite on X axis, it moves along path.  Move sprite on Y axis, it moves <br>perpendicular to path.<br><br>Parenting.  Extremely useful.  Create a menu background, then put buttons on it.  The buttons are children of the menu.  <br>They are in menu space.  When the menu moves, the buttons move with it.  When the menu rotates, the buttons rotate with <br>it.  When the menu is hidden, the buttons hide with it.  And you can select certain attributes the children won't pick<br>up on.  For example, you can make it so the children DON'T rotate with the parent when it rotates, but they move when it<br>moves, or rotates, or scales, because their position is still relative to parent space.<br><br>TFormPoint, TFormVector, TFormNormal.  Really useful math functions that allow you to easily do things like determine if<br>a sprite is in a 45 degree arc in "front" of another sprite which is rotated, and then have that sprite apply thrust in<br>the correct direction because you can just pass a vector in the sprite's space that points forwards to the TFormVector <br>function and transform it into global space for your physics code.<br><br>Shadows.  Cast a drop shadow from any sprite.  No extra images required.  One command, three parameters, bada bing, bada <br>boom, shadow!<br><br>Renderstate storage and restoration on a stack.  Sprite system won't change what color you set.  It saves all those <br>render parameters before it goes to work, and restores them after.  And you can use those functions too.<br><br><br><br>Anyway I'll just wrap this up with this:<br>----------------------------------------<br><br>I wrote the original version of this system in Blitzplus, and used it to make Lego Builder Bots.  When I ported it to <br>Blitmax, I made it 10x better.  So I know I've got a rock solid design, and that if you use it you will be pleasantly <br>surprised at how often you need a particular feature, and find the system already supports it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Fast enough to render over 1000 sprites per frame.  As fast as Blitzmax is at drawing images normally.<br><br>Are collisions fast?  They should be more than fast enough. They use the collision functions provided by Blitzmax, and those check bounding rects before they do the pixel perfect tests.<br><br>Will I add more collision functions?  Maybe.  As I mentioned above, I like the idea of being able to automatically call a function when a collision occurs.  And I might add a point collision wrapper for the rect collision function.<br><br>Documentation?  Each function has a block of comments above it, and there are other comments strewn about the code.  ZSprite's docs are the same thing really, except he formatted his comments in a way which is compatable with the Max help system.  I think the format the help system requires for comments looks messy though.  So I chose to have the code be neat over seperate help docs.<br><br>Examples?  There's a few examples with my system, but not many.  I don't have time to write lots of examples, and there's really no need for them.  The system is very simple to use.  If you can't figure it out fairly easily after looking at the examples I provided to give you the basic jist of how things work, might I suggest you take up knitting? :-)<br><br>DX and OpenGL?  Yes.  Both.  My system draws sprites with the same Max image functions you have access to.  ZSprite on the other hand calls OpenGL functions.  It probably does not work with DirectX. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Anyway, if I round the coords it is a bit jittery, just like is was in BPlus, a problem that I could never remove.  Basically if the HZ is 60 and your object moves at 50 pixels per sec, it will NEVER look totally smooth.  At least the anti-aliasing gives it a smooth effect.
