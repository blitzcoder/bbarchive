Think of a second thread as a standalone function that runs side by side with your main thread. All threads have access to the main variables ( globals ) or you pass in a object that you can use to hold any variables that you want the thread to use. You can use the ThreadRunning function to know if your thread is done or not. As long in your main thread you dont touch the same variables thats being used in the second 'loading thread' then its really straight forward.<br><br>A bare bones simple example to help get your head around it, in your game you'd obviously flesh it out to something realistic :-<br><br><pre class=code>

In that scenario you will get inconsistent and at best corrupt results but more than likely a crash due to incomplete and corrupt data. Mutexes place a special lock on cpu threads and using clever internals allow one thread run, this can cause cpu stalls and stuff, which is all internal cpu complexities, but still it matters, especially if you forget to unlock a mutex, and also you can end up with deadlocks :- one thread which uses some data from another locks while waiting for the data to come from another thread, but that other thread is locked out so you end up the first thread deadlocked and waiting.  Something else to think about is that once the data is loaded and if you know that it isnt ever going to change, then its perfectly safe for any amount threads to READ the data at the same time. The problems only come about when reading AND writing to or from the same variable from different threads at the same time.<br><br>On the contrary there are atomic functions that allow you to read and write to a variable of an atomic type without using a mutex to protect it - in 'Max land an atomic type would be an Int type. Without going on about this bit too much, an Object variable is a 32bit Int value as its passed around by reference so things can be carefully planned out to make 'lock free' code, but you need to be REALLY careful and its not easy - its easier to use a mutex. Multithreading is a big area and what you want to do with it is nice, easy and straight-forward.<br><br><div class="quote"> <br>Oh, and the thread Function - can it be a method in a class, instead of a function?<br> <br></div><br><br>It has to be a function yes, you can use a function inside a type but does need to be a function. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Mutexes are useful to block access to variables used by multiple threads.<br><br>Before manipulating a variable which both threads access: you use LockMutex(aMutexYouCreatedFirst) and after finishing manipulation you UnLockMutex(aMutexYouCreatedFirst).<br><br>That "LockMutex" takes care of not manipulating an object in the same time ... it waits until the other thread "unlocked" the mutex again.<br><br>If it is no crucial data - and you do not want to block the flow of a thread, you use "TryLockMutex(...)" - it returns "true" if it was able to get the lock in this loop. This is useful if you eg. want to fetch a queue of something (events, objects to load).<br><br>A more specific example for you:<br>Your loader-object has a list of what to load.<br>The loader should do its work in a second thread.<br>If your mainthread now wants to add ressources to load ... it can do a TryLockMutex() - if it was successful, the loader is not locking that mutex in this moment and you can modify eg. loader.list. After adding, you unlock the mutex.<br>Meanwhile the loader object in its own thread loops and checks if there is something to do. If it successfully loaded something and is now wanting to remove that from the list of "to-load-objects" the loader cannot just "TryLockMutex" - it must assure to remove the entry from the list - that is why "LockMutex" has to get used. That loader-thread is now "halted" until it gets the lock of the mutex. After it got the mutex (next line of code is exectuted now) you can remove safely from the list and unlock the mutex again.<br><br>You see: use "TryLockMutex" to avoid halted threads (eg. mainthread - to display things smoothly) and use "LockMutex" if you need to get something happen in this loop.<br><br><br>I know that "prosa text" isn't the same as posting sample code - but maybe it helps to understand things.<br><br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

All the efficient/classical lock-free algorithms predate modern CPU design and they rely on in-order instruction execution; the fact that modern CPUs execute instructions in parallel even on a single core effectively wrecks all of the assumptions behind this style of coding. It's no safer than uncontrolled data sharing as a result (the solution is either to fake locks using something extremely inefficient like a stream or a timer, which is pointless as it's worse than the real thing, or to use barrier instructions which you don't have access to from above the assembly level).</strike> (edit: only true for archaic definitions of "lock free", )<br><br>The standard solution proposed by most languages/systems is to avoid code that writes outside its own thread at all. Don't allow your threads to share <i>any</i> writable data objects and you're guaranteed to be safe: just give them something read-only to work from and have them all report their newly created result data in turn when they're done through a standardised safe returning object (write mutex code once for this object and never think about it again, basically). You can enforce read-only attributes either by convention or by abstracting the interface. In practice it's rare for <i>good</i> code to need to share data between threads that often (if they're sharing, they're waiting, and the operation is then basically serial anyway), and this is increasingly the case as the number of threads rises.<br><br>In the case of the original question, for instance, there's no need for any sharing in between the order to start loading, and the report that loading is done containing the created data. No locks, or "lock-free" substitutes: no contact at all. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
