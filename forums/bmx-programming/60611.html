The Devil is cursing like made while Jesus is just setting there polishing his nails. God asks Jesus and the Devil what kind of program they finished for all man kind, the Devil curses at God because God turned off the power before the Devil was finished writing his program, causing him to loose all of his work.

That's why I say it's so improbable. We're talking different monitors, different keyboard, even the most unlikely candidates. And no, no links in software either.
