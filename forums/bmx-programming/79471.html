On my Core 2 duo 2.5GHz laptop T9300 6Mb internal cache, it's perfectly ok but not "snappy" when started first time after booting. Being a .net application it works better after I've been using the app for a while and (i guess) the JIT compiler has done some work.<br><br>But on the other side it doesn't seem to slow down at all when writing quite a lot of code. In MaxIDE there was a notable slowdown when loading a .bmx file that was 20kb+<br><br>Blide has given me a completely new level of joy when programming BlitzMax as i feel "comfy" and BLide makes the programming experience feel professional and up to date.<br><br>(I don't wanna hurt anyones feelings here(about MaxIDE), but simple syntax-markup is avaliable in the simplest editors novadays, and Code completion/Intellisence is what's been expected when writing in an IDE the last 5-8 years) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I have a project of more than 30 bmx, and one bmx is more than 3000 lines of code (207kb), and there are no speed issues at all.<br><br>2) Have you ever had any source files corrupted by Blide?<br><br>- NO.<br><br>3) Did it configure your main blitz ide, compiler, etc, in some weird way to cause problems?<br><br>- NO.<br><br>4) Do you ever use the normal BMax IDE on occasion? If so why?<br><br>- Not anymore, I dont need to. When i used the Free edition of Blide, i used the BMax IDE to see xml code highlights, but now i just Blide Plus since it includes xml code highlighting.<br><br>5) Have you used the exe compression? Does it work?<br><br>- I never used it for now.<br><br>6) Is icon and version generation stable and working?<br><br>- I didnt use the icon generator yet.<br><br>Dont forget it also comes with a bitmap font creator. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But in terms of usability? MUCH faster to get around a large project in BLIde (because of solution management) versus the normal IDE. For example, I couldn't imagine trying to manage a 66 file, 7791 lines of code, and still growing project <i>manually</i> in the default blitzmax IDE. I have several of these types of projects, and BLIde makes it super easy to navigate through them with minimal fuss and much higher productivity.<br><br><div class="quote"> <br>2) Have you ever had any source files corrupted by Blide?<br> <br></div><br>Short answer: No.<br>Long answer: Nope.<br><br><div class="quote"> <br>3) Did it configure your main blitz ide, compiler, etc, in some weird way to cause problems?<br> <br></div><br>As someone said earlier, they are independent and can easily co-exist. To this date I haven't had issues.<br><br><div class="quote"> <br>4) Do you ever use the normal BMax IDE on occasion? If so why?<br> <br></div><br>On rare occasions when I was testing out new BLIde builds for Ziggy I booted up the default IDE to help isolate problems. But that's a special case for beta testers more than normal/stable version users.<br><br><div class="quote"> <br>5) Have you used the exe compression? Does it work?<br> <br></div><br>Yes I have and it works wonderfully. I used for my Farseer.BMX demo application. It took my 1.35MB exe (with no icon support) and compressed it to 645kb (with icons and ALL assets inside the exe).<br><br><div class="quote"> <br>6) Is icon and version generation stable and working?<br> <br></div><br>Haven't messed with version generation so I can't say much, but I was pretty knee deep in icon stuff for the physics demo app, and it works. There was an issue with the icon not appearing in the title bar of the app (though this is a limitation of blitzmax itself not BLide), but Ziggy was able to fix it and now BLide published apps on my machine have fully working icons in alt+tab, taskbar, desktop/menus, and titlebar. So it's kind of a bonus to use BLIde for that. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

BlitzMax and BLide are by far my best investments software-wise.<br><br>Being a kid from the C64 generation, my (non geek) friends sometimes ask me: "My kid want's to make own games. What language do you recommend".<br><br>The last three times I've got this question I've told them to download the BlitzMax or Blitz3D demo and see if the kid likes it. (Not all kids will have the mindset and patience to do it, but the demos are functional enough to find out).<br><br>If some of them learns BlitzMax I'll surely recommend BLide for him/her too (or maybe even give it as a birthday present). BLide is similar to other better known IDEs so the experience gained can be used on other platforms.<br><br>The fun thing is that this hobby can provide an ok living in the future. At least this is what happened to me :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Have you added the MinGW bin folder to path? (usually something like c:\MinGW\bin)<br><br>1b.) Open a cmd.exe prompt. type "gcc --version" to ensure the path really works.<br><br>2.) Have you defined the MinGW environment variable? (mine: MinGW=C:\MinGW)<br><br>2b.) Open cmd.exe. write: "%mingw%\bin\gcc --version" to ensure that the MinGW variable is pointing to the right place<br><br>Additional info: If you have spaces in the path to MinGW on your machine you might have to fiddle around with double quotes ["] around parts of your variable defined paths to have them work. When 1b and 2b runs (and displays correct compiler info) on your computer you're ok.<br><br>BTW: I'm using MinGW 5.1.3<br><br>My memory suxx but I seem to remember I had to add the MinGW env-var to have BLide rebuild my modules.<br><br>Note1: Restart cmd.exe after fiddling with the env-vars. cmd.exe reads them up at start so if you alter env-vars under "My Computer-&gt;Properties" you'll need to restart cmd.exe to try the changes out.<br>Note2: Restart Blide after all changes when you get it to work under cmd.exe.<br><br>edit: some spelling and additional info. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
