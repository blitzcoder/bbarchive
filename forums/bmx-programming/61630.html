Here in the US, stuff stinks up because the "author" always has the copyrights automatically. If they decide to release it under whatever terms, then thats that. It can be a huge gray area. Something that always sux for ppl in the US to deal with. This was no intention to be a flame back towards your remark... more informational for why I stated what I did earlier.<br><br>Honestly, H&amp;K has a valid point. Now that you are part of the BRL team (correct me if I'm wrong), you really don't want ppl stealing the source of Blitz* and republishing it under a new title without passing it by you all first right? (I understand that its a bit of a different context, but the same principle)<br><br>I  just like to play the "fair is fair" tactic. If I took some of your code that you so generously distribute and use it in my works (idea or code itself), I would place a tribute to you in my program. Usually thats all most developers would even like to have if anything at all.<br><br>@AngelDaniel: Glad you found something you like. :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
