If you have your array as part of a Type you can override this by writing your own Compare() Method.  All this method does is take one object as a parameter (your array in this instance) and compares it to the current object.  It then returns -1, 0, or 1 depending on whether the object should be considered less then or greater than the one passed to it (might be the other way round!).  You don't have to worry too much about what's being passed as long as you're doing the comparison correctly.  That all sounds very complicated, so here's a little example...<br><br><pre class=code>

In practice, with my 30,000-item dataset, it went from over a minute to about 1/5 second.<br><br>My horrible kludge:<br><br>1.  The objects to be sorted need ToString() and FromString(string) methods that translate all of the object's fields into a single string (just as if you were saving the stuff to disk in human-readable format, so these routines are useful to have anyway.)  Put the fields in the order you want them sorted in, and use RSet() to right-justify any integers.  In other words, to sort by last name and then by first name, when your data set includes names and game scores, you would translate the records into this string array:<br><br>stringarray[0] = "SMITH JOHN     123"<br>stringarray[1] = "SMITHERS WAYLON 1234567"<br>etc.<br><br>2.  Alphabetize that array with stringarray.Sort()!  Wow, that was fast.<br><br>3.  Clear the list (thus deleting all its objects), and re-create all the objects from the strings in the array.  This means writing a parser (such as the equivalent of Perl's split() function.)<br><br>Even though that's a cumbersome (and potentially fragile) way of going about things, like I said, in my case it was a 500x speedup versus using SortList().<br><br>Here's code I'm using to do that on an existing TList of CPFile objects.

</pre><br><br>Basically, if you can pack your data into an array of strings rather than a TList of fancy objects, the combination of doing those conversions plus the quicksort is still a zillion times faster than sorting the TList.  Linked lists aren't efficient data structures in situations where you don't need their unique features.<br><br>(And if your objects are already stored in an array rather than a TList, that saves a few steps.)<br><br>The bulk of the work here is that you need to write ToString() and FromString(string) methods for your objects, but again, if you need to save them to disk, you can use those same routines (also great for debugging, because the save files can be opened in your text editor.)<br><br>If you want to sort the same data according to different rules, then just add a "Select" block to the ToString and FromString methods akin to what I did in the previous example. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
