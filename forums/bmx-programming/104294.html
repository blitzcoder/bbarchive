I got this working without understanding it very well.  This is actually Monkey code but should work under Blitzmax without all that much modification, but you should probably rewrite it yourself so you have at least *some* idea what's going on.  This is someone else's code from this forum, can't remember whose but it's either in the archive or in the forum.  Works real well.<br><br>There are a bunch of ways you can optimize this but worry about it later, this works plenty well enough for a <br>reasonable number of collisions and if you exceed that you're going to be entering exponential territory (20,000 x 20,000 objects starts to slow down) and then you're going to need to do some sort of binning, and if that's the case I can help you with that too but dividing the play area into quadrants, and doing collisions per quadrant, should solve the problem.<br><br><pre class=code>

That will be the process of learning it.  We can't just explain it because to understand you will have to learn the material :)  I would suggest that you ignore the "exactly touching" part of the math because that's hairiest and unnecessary-- just do "if collided, don't actually add the velocity to the position and just go ahead and do collision response anyway."  Nowadays ticks are moving fast enough that you shouldn't need to have objects moving in huge steps anyway.<br><br>The best thing I can suggest is to look at that code snippet I posted and really dissect it until you can see what's going on.<br><br>You're definitely going in the right direction with atan and all the annoying modulos that you have to do.  At some point, either with this or something else, you will run into angle-related things that will have to happen differently depending on which of the four quadrants the angle falls into.<br><br>Since this is an asteroids game, you have to ask yourself how physically precise the collisions really need to be anyway.  If the roids are irregularly shaped, there can be a pretty good degree of random slop and have it still look pretty realistic. <br><br>At some point in an asteroids game, if you are using vector graphics, you are going to want to do line-wise collision detection.  You do that by finding one of the line intersection tests in the code archives, getting that working with two lines, and then loop through each of the line segments in the two colliding objects to see which line segments crossed, if any.<br><br>But don't worry about that right now :)  Do some simple billiards test until you figure out how it works.  <br><br>Your code said this:<br><pre class=code>
Ship.XSpeed = Ship.XSpeed / -1
Ship.YSpeed = Ship.YSpeed / -1
</pre><br><br>The problem with that is, you're going to find that a lot of the time, that method of bouncing is going to yield an extremely unrealistic result.  Think about it, imagine if you were bouncing a ball off a wall and it always bounced off in exactly the reverse of the angle it was moving when it hit the wall!  You're better off just getting some thrust vector from your arctan angle, and then adding that thrust vector to your ship velocity vector.  That'll make it at least SOMEWHAT realistic.<br><br>EASIEST approach is to see which of four quadrants the asteroid is in with relation to your ship (if it's to my upper left, do this... if it's to my upper right do this...) while remembering to take into account if it's directly above or to the side of you.  If you can do that, you should be able to get a general idea of what direction the bounce should take, and add that, plus some random factor, to your ship velocity vector.<br><br><a href="http://www.education.com/science-fair/article/linear-momentum-find-perfect-90/" target="_blank">http://www.education.com/science-fair/article/linear-momentum-find-perfect-90/</a><br><br>Here's one hint if you want to take the more physical approach.<br><br>Add 90 degrees to your collision angle that you got with atan.  That line is the line that your ball is going to REFLECT OFF OF, just the way a billiard would bounce off a wall in pool.  But then you're going to need to add some portion of the velocity of the asteroid to your ship, and vice versa-- say 40% of the velocity of each gets kicked off onto the other, and the remaining 20% goes away as heat, acting as a damping factor.  If you don't have damping factors in physics simulations things tend to go totally haywire really fast.<br><br>You should decide if you want game physics or realistic physics.  If you want realistic physics you need to make an effort to get to grips with some of the math, so if you just want a working game, do something quick and dirty and worry about perfecting it later (that would be my advice.)  Then again, this is pretty easy math and you should have it in a few days if that.<br><br>One last suggestion I'll just throw out there is to make SURE you know what you are doing with your ints and floats here because if you don't you can end up with some extremely strange behavior and not know why. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
