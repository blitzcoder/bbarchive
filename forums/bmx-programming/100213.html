The server will receive it and print the received message.<br><br>Hopefully the comments will explain what's going on!<br><br>To talk to an actual web server (we're effectively using our own protocol here), you need to read up on what the HTTP server is expecting to come in and what the client needs to send it. To find protocol information, Google "RFC" along with the protocol you're interested in -- in this case "HTTP".<br><br>Also make use of the Code Archives here, under the Networking section. If you hit my profile and then "Code archive entries" you'll find examples of clients and servers of various types. These are generally multithreaded, which complicates things, so use the above to get a grasp of the basics of communicating between clients and server first.<br><br>Finally, this example uses IP address 127.0.0.1 (which is always the local PC), so expects you to run the server and client on the same PC in separate MaxIDE instances. If you have more than one PC on a LAN, you can run the server on one PC and the client on the other, changing the IP in the client code from 127.0.0.1 to that of the PC which is running the server and it should work. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

(However, it will then get 'stuck' and fail, since we're not following the back-and-forth protocol for communications between web browsers and web servers, so you'll just have to terminate the server at that point!) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Something I forgot to ask: I've noticed that some games (Minecraft and Terraria as examples) require port forwarding to enable online play, whereas mainstream games - naturally - do not. What is it that makes some games require the player to manually open ports on their router, but not other games and programs? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

(There's nothing to stop a client program implementing some server capabilities.)<br><br>It's really just a case of opening a port on your router to allow incoming connections to the server application running on your local network; most ports would be blocked by default. Port forwarding is a PITA because you can't realistically do it programmatically -- there must be thousands of different router configuration interfaces. I think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play" target="_blank">UPnP</a> handles this, but of course not all routers implement it.<br><br>I believe that if all clients go through a central server (eg. a game connects to a server operated by a web hosting company and ALL communications  between clients go through that) -- as you'd get in most mainstream games -- then port forwarding would not be required. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
