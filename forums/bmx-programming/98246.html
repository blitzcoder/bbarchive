It would be lovely to be able to code in 2880x1800 resolution on my new machine!  :). I haven't yet received the computer, but I take it it will appear like 1440x900 unless it's specifically updated?<br><br>I'm working on a large commercial venture in it which could take several years, and it would really improve my coding environment to have at least this feature added.<br><br>On a somewhat-related tangent, I know BMax support is on the low side at the moment, but I still wish MaxIDE had had some more updates over the years, such as code completion - I'd love the features of BLIde, but I really don't want to work on two platforms... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You could switch out of retina mode into a standard resolution if your eyes are good enough to take advantage of the extra screen space. In theory it should be fairly easy to add support to it as it's all OS standard components and very few graphics. The biggest problem with getting it working I suspect would be compiling the IDE under a new version of XCode that includes the retina API, which I'm pretty sure with require LLVM. This shouldn't be too hard by my understanding, and needs to happen some time anyway if people want to continue to submit bmax apps to the app store since the change will be required to use sandboxing as well. But this requires monkeying around with BMK. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It isn't a new resolution (though you can use it as such if you prefer but then things are tiiiiiiny), it is a new pixel density. E.g. All iPads are 1024x768 however the retina iPad has 2048x1536 actual pixels. With retina support screens are measured in points, not pixels, making rendering of content independent from the physical device by letting the hardware take care of it. If you are at a 1x pixel density then 1 point is 1 pixel, but retina is 2x. In the future they could make 4x to silence then wingers that claim they can still see the pixels (hold it normal distance as instruceted, if you can see the pixels you're too close..., that's kinda the point).<br><br>Native cocoa elements are handled by the os and as such are generally rendered at 2x automatically. Art assets and anything else manually rendered will need to be up scaled. Carbon and related depreciated Apis are not supported. One of the companion programs for the new beta xcodes includes the ability to simulate retina on a normal screen by halving the resolution to create a 2x pixel density to test with, if you're curious how your app looks and don't have access to a retina pro then give it a shot.<br><br>Regarding the death of the DVD drive, it's called the future, you'll find your self there sooner or later. That isn't to say that the DVD drive is already dead, but in all honesty how often does the average or even pro user use their optical drive these days? I for one have used an optical drive 4 times in the last year, twice to burn large files for friends because they forgot to bring USB drives, and twice to install windows... I'll gladly take the weight and power savings, and the. Just network a drive off another computer (Mac or pc) or just plug in an external on those hyper rare occasions. Of all my work associates and family I have used an optical drive more than everyone else combined in the last year. Granted I don't buy any physical media oth than console games, and I'm tech savvy, etc. etc. but still, in the real world, for normal users, the writing is on the wall, just as it was for serial, scsi and printer ports when USB came a long. It takes time to transition but in 3 years how many pcs will ship with a cd drive.<br><br>And before someone says I think apple just gets there first it took them for freaking ever to finally get around to USB 3 and it was entirely for selfish reasons on their end trying to push thunderbolt. Both are good, both are different and I'm glad they came to their senses before 3 became the market leading standard, that woulda sucked...<br><br>For a micro review of the new MacBook pro retina if anyone cares. It's an absolute beast. It's a truly portable Mac pro. The option for extra resolution gives tons more work space than a normal pro, the weight savings and added battery life make a huge difference if you move around with it (not just an easily luggable desktop like most heavy duty laptops). It's definitely not an air, but quad i7 and a very decent graphics set makes the extra weight worth it. I'm not a huge fan of retina displays in general, I'm good enough with standard resolution, but if you work with graphics a lot then it would make all the difference in the world. Plugging it into 3 screens + it's own for an instant 4 head setup is more fun than it should be. Yea it's stupid expensive, and yea since its device #1 for desktop os retina tons of apps look ugly now. And it really needs to run mountain lion, putting lion on it is just an insult to the hardware, but clearly ml got delayed and they had to ship so that's what they did. If you can afford it, it really is worth the money, but affording it is a biiiig ask. Fwiw then only spec that really makes sense is the base model + the ram upgrade. Since the ram is fixed, you only get one shot and it's not expensive by apple standards, almost down to 3rd party prices and it's high spec high grade ram so suck it up. All other upgrades and the higher spec just don't make sense price to performance unless it's someone else's credit card :0)<br><br>Sory to hijack the thread, but it seemed like the verge of missinformation and incorrect assumptions so thought I would try to head it off... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I never use my ODD anyway and have unlimited bandwidth, as well as having the Mac Pro for wireless ODD if I need it, so it works well for me.  Apple always lead with the 'removal of standards' - it's frustrating sometimes (FW400 is more of a loss for me due to my sound card.  Ethernet is fine as TB-&gt;ethernet is fine.)  The screen really is a step forward.  MaxIDE looks as expected, although the low res is more pronounced because of the contrast and probably due to the fact that there are 4 pixels representing 1, and the actual pattern of the LCD panel must contribute to this (less bleed between pixels making the enlargement appear sharper maybe?)<br><br>Unfortunately I can't get my game to work, I have that weird bug where multi-dimensional arrays don't work, and can't seem to solve it.  Tried Xcode 4.2.1 and 4.3.3, everything builds fine but MD-arrays hold null at runtime.<br><br>Hopefully once I've solved it, this'll be a great workhorse for a number of years...<br><br>@shinkiro1<br><br>I'm actually fine with MaxIDE feature-wise, the lack of code completion is only a WIBNIF feature for me anyway.  I've just released a 4-year game where the tools were written in BMax (although the engine was in Flash + Air), so I find it pretty good for large-scale projects, despite its simplicity. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
