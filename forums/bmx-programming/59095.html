You wouldn't beleive how hard it is to get this info though.  <br><br>Almost all collisions between objects in physics are done between objects with the same elasticity, and finding info on what happens when two objects with different elasticity collide is nigh impossible.  But I got lucky and found this:<br><br>"A perfectly happy ball is one that bounces to its original height when dropped on a massive, rigid surface. A completely unhappy ball does not bounce at all. In the former case, the coefficient of restitution (COR) is unity. In the latter case, the COR is zero. It is shown that when an unhappy ball collides with a happy ball, the COR increases from zero to unity as the stiffness of the happy ball decreases from infinity to zero. The COR is independent of the mass of each ball."<br><br>Which tells me exactly what I need to know, and it now appears that I need to add a stiffness parameter, and use that to calculate the COR after a collision.<br><br>The only problem is I have no idea how one determines the "stiffness" of an object so I don't know realistic values for this.<br><br>Interesting to consider though is a perfectly elastic ball with infinite stiffness.  It would be like a pool ball, but bounce like a bounce ball.  The only thing is, I couldn't imagine energy not being lost in great amounts with each collision due to the sound produced from the hard object hitting the hard surface.  Loss of energy being something I'm also not simulating yet. :-)<br><br>But anyway, now I have to figure out how to convert that first paragraph into an equation which takes Sprite1 and Sprite2 elasticity and stiffness into account to calculate cor.

My problem is something not covered on either of those pages, and that is dtermining what happens when a bouncy ball hits a cinderblock.  The cinderblock would have a coefficient of restitution of 0, and the bouncy ball would have a coefficient of restitution of 1.  Neither of these values would provide the correct collision result.  The way I was doing it was to multiply them togther, but that's not right, because then the cinderblock makes the bouncy ball not bounce off it, and that is clearly wrong.<br><br>I found this equation in a pdf document about collisions between cars with varying stiffness:<br><br><pre class=code>
Elasticity# = Sqr(((Sprite2._Mass#*Sprite1._Elasticity#)^2 + (Sprite1._Mass#*Sprite2._Elasticity#)^2) / (Sprite1._Mass# + Sprite2._Mass#))
</pre><br><br>But it doesn't work.  The objects bounce off one another with great velocity.  And COR is not supposed to be tied to mass according to other pages I've read.<br><br>I might end up coming up with a different fake.  Multiplying the COR for each sprite together doesn't produce good results, but adding them and then dividing by 2 would at least produce better results, if not entirely physically accurate ones.  Of course that would still be wrong since you don't want a perfectly elastic ball hitting a perfeclty inelastic floor to only rebound with 50% of it's energy.<br><br>So maybe a better solution is to use Max(COR1, COR2).  Then collisions between elastic objects will be right, and collisions between ineslastic objects will be right, and collisions between elastic and inelastic objects will be trated as elastic.<br><br>I'm not sure if that last one is the correct physical result , but it might be close enough.<br><br>[edit]<br>Well I don't know if it is physically accurate or not, but Max seems to work well and the results it produces look realistic enough.  So I'll go with that for now.<br>[/edit] <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Link is same as old demo:<br><br>www.seamlesstexturegenerator.com/systems/Swift.Sprite.System.Physics.Demo.zip<br><br>Some things to note:<br><br>There's no air friction being modeled yet, so you'll see objects with low mass like the balloon occasionally fly about like mad.  Air friction would limit the top speed so it would slow down quickly after receiving such an acceleration.<br><br>There's no sliding friction along the ground.  I don't know if I will implement that or not, but I may well implement something similar where energy is lost during each collision.  The only problem there is I have to tie that to the physics step time, or else sliding objects would slow down faster when doing more physics steps per frame, or when the framerate is higher.  On the flip side, doing that means that the amount of energy lost in a regular collision would then be tied to the time step, and that would mean that that would vary instead.  Hm.  Perhaps the only way to solve that is to implement both.  Anyway "ground friction" at least will be implemented, but that will affect an object whether it is colliding with anything or not because people need that for overhead games. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It was driving me nuts.  <br><br>I found a solution though, finally, this morning.  <br><br>There wasn't much of a tunneling issue if the sprites were totally elastic, but there was when they were less than perfectly elastic.  I figured out that I could take the difference between what I wanted, and what I'd get with perfect elasticity, and then move the objects one time using the perfect elasticity when the collision occurs.<br><br>If you imagine a ball sitting on the ground, and imagine that you wait one second between physics calculations, then each second, a 9.8 pixel downward acceleration will pull the sprite against the ground.  This will make it penetrate the ground.  Now, if I have elastic collisions, it will immediately move back up, to rest upon the ground again because it is in effect, bouncing, even though we can't see it.  But if the collisions are somewhat less elastic, then the rebound force will be less than the force needed to get it back to it's original position.  The result?  Objects sink into the ground.  I figured out though that I can have the benefit of both worlds, by taking that moment to move the object back the amount needed to put it back outside the  ground again, moving it just enough to compensate for the little bit that the somewhat inelastic collision won't give back.  The ball will still only have the inelastic amount of force returned to it, but it will not sink into the ground either.<br><br>It works great so far.  The only problem I'm having now is that when a sprite collides with a square object, because the collision normals I'm using are for a circle, it passes through the corners as if they are not there.  There's no restitutuon in the correct direction to push it back outside the object.  So now I have to solve the problem of calculating the correct normals for oddly shaped sprites. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Remember how you would set up collisions in Blitz3D?  By specifying two ID's that should collide, and setting the ID for each entity, so it is part of a certain group of objects that behave a certain way?  Well you can do the exact same thing with the physics system now.  You still have to manually update certain things like collisions with walls, but most of your sprite to sprite collision stuff can now be handled with collision sets!  See the demo source to see how  both methods work.<br><br>So anyway, I'm pretty happy with it at this point.  It's not perfect yet, but it's pretty darn good, and it's easy to use now.

I had tons of variables in it calcualting horsepower and torque and all sorts of stuff like that, and the stupid plane still wouldn't fly because I needed to simulate still more things.

And of course you have to determine if the ball is in contact with the ground or not to decide whether to apply either friction, or just a simple "ground friction" as I will be using which is somehwere between the two. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I ended up not needing it for the game I was developing so it fell by the wayside.  It does everything you see in the demo of course; collisions, acceleration, etc... but it lacks certain features like friction.  I could add friction in a day or so if someone requested it however, but I don't think anyone is using that aspect of the system yet. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The latest changes include tying the physics update code to the regular animaton update code to make it easier to just use the physics at any time with no special setup.  If you're just getting the system you might want to request this version, but none of the demos have been updated to use it.  It does have information on how to convert old code to use the new setup though.  Few function calls have changed and the main loop needs a little rearranging on the functions.
