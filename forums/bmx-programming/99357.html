Now, I'm reluctant to mention that as I know precisely where this thread is now going, so before it does, what you (as in, "anybody" - not any specific person) are actually getting by releasing this way is a "fire and forget" method of releasing a game.  You don't have to do any marketing, no websites, no promotion whatsoever, no customer service (in my experience) and you're putting your game immediately before an audience of several million customers.<br><br>If you think this sucks and you can do better yourself, then you're of course free to do so. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Time investment aside, Crime Solitaire was done on a budget of under $200, and saw a five-figure return in the first month.  My new game, out mid-December, has cost me a bit under $6,000 as I outsourced as much as possible to free myself up for programming.

Also I use Mantis for bug tracking, and Subversion for backups.<br><br>I've also used DazStudio in the past, and Vue for scenery renders.

But it's not as straightforward as that.  It took me two and a half years to complete, and was abandoned at least twice.  I did all the artwork myself with Daz Studio and Vue, and that's what took much of the time.  Progress had stopped for several months at one point as I couldn't get into a workflow with any graphics style I was happy with.<br><br>Other than the time investment, it did make enough for me to buy a Mac, plus I upgraded my camera to a Canon EOS 450D and various lenses including a 500mm monster of a lens which alone cost over £600.  But bigger than that, and regardless of the money it made, the results encouraged me to do more.  You'll remember when I was writing for Idigicon I said 'i quit' after nearly every game because it was too much work for too little reward.  So, if nothing else, the change in attitude should tell you that since I partnered with BFG, i'm in a much better place both financially and mentally.<br><br>Crime Solitaire (which took about nine months) is still selling quite well, over a year after release.  Although it did five figures in its first month, monthly stats now are much lower but importantly, its still steady month on month.  I couldn't really live on the monthly sales now if that's all there was, so i had to bear in mind that the massive sales spike at the start is going to have to supplement my income until the next sales spike (when my next game is released, next month).  If you go out and spend your first months income on the assumption that the next 6 or 12 months will be the same, then you'll probably be up crap creek because it just doesn't work like that.<br><br>About BFG - I like working with them.  There's no pressure as the only deadline I have ever had, is the ones I set for myself.  Without giving too much away, the intro for my new game made a few of the female members of staff squirm a bit, so they did ask if I could tone down a little by removing certain graphic elements (one was a hatchet, so I replaced it with a sink plunger for comedy effect).  Other than that they've never really asked me to hold back with anything, but that's maybe because I know what the target audience is and work towards that anyway.<br><br>They do supply you with a document on their guidelines/standards but the majority is common sense, like making sure the game can exit cleanly by whatever method is 'standard' for the OS etc, storing game data in the correct place etc.  also, it's handy to do lots of research and find out how games similar to yours function, and how the player is expected to interact with them. That will give you the best idea of how to deal with functionality.<br><br>Just a wee discaimer, this stuff is only my personal experience.  Others might have had the same experiences or could differ greatly to my own, but that's obviously for them to say. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Infact my previous job did the exact same to me and ended up pushing me away from web stuff and back into game related stuff! It is good that art of magic gave you back the creative spark, its a hard habbit/hobby/profession to draw away from :)!<br><br>The bit about the money spike is very helpful and I currently have over a year practice living off a micro budget. Been developing Objecty for quite a while now ( <a href="http://www.objecty.co.uk" target="_blank">http://www.objecty.co.uk</a> ) and launched a kickstarter, but the Kickstarter campaign has not gone down well. It has had amazing feedback from most people but just not backed up with high enough numbers of backers. I put it down to bad timing, rushing some finer details and not enough money left in the kitty to do things properly. So I have to go back to the drawing board and earn some more before I spend some more developing it further. It will pay off in the long run but the short term is stressful, highly! <br><br>Thats interesting to hear about the documents and good freedom to create. So did you arrange a partnership prior to developing your games or did you send over a prototype of some sort? <br><br>Totally get that these are your experiences, all I have ever heard is positive from BFG so its really helpful to get some actual detailed info about it all. I have a good idea for a game based on the casual genre, I also have a decent (original I think?) idea for a higher risk arcade physics game which I have the starts of a prototype. but the draw of something with less risk is too much to ignore. At least to give myself a boost after the let down of kickstarter.<br><br>All very interesting. Thanks :)<br><br>It is very interesting isnt it Mike!

All three of my games were at beta stage before I even submitted them to anybody, and to be honest I would never tie myself into a contract on an unfinished project anyway, unless it was being funded, as there's no advantage in doing so.  With contracts, come deadlines, deadlines = stress, stress = another nervous breakdown (I've had some spectacular meltdowns in recent years and been on medication since 2006, so I don't fancy another episode!).<br><br>I did show the intro as soon as it was done (and that was about 60% of the way through development).  The reason I did that was because I thought I might be sailing a bit close to the wind with the theme (there's kind of a growing tension feel with something happening right at the end), and as it turned out, I was right.  But a video of the intro was all that they saw, not a half-finished, bug-ridden game which might have painted the game in a very dim light.  Everybody is always eager to show off what they've done - I am too, but ultimately you don't want anybody seeing your game until it's at its absolute best, because that's what it's going to get judged on. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Pretty sure if I never made that game some people round here would still be making match-3s or something completely different :-) Another early clone was Faerie Solitaire, which I think may have also been made with BlitzMax.<br><br>Match-3s don't do as well as those solitaire games and there's not much difference in art cost or dev time, so if starting from scratch, Solitaire is a better option.  Having said that Spring Bonus just hit $50K revenue (to me) in 18 months, so not too bad for a 3 month game (built on my existing match-3 engine).  HOG/Adventures are basically too expensive to make for most small devs due to massive art spend.  Time Management can still do well but those games are pretty complex now (you need be a good game designer to figure the mechanics out).  Other genres like Word or Action don't do very well on BFG so forget them.<br><br>So why aren't I making more solitaire games? Well I'd have to code it from scratch as BFG own the source to Fairway, and it's easier to just make more match-3s.  However, you lot are making me jealous and so I may have to re-enter the arena soon.  Got some plans anyway.<br><br>Good luck to you all with you next games. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There have been traditional solitaire games (Klondike) and also Majhong style (where you have to match two of the same value cards).  I played a game called Mystery Solitaire years ago, which is Mahjong style, and liked it a lot.  Tripeaks is pretty popular too.  Fairway Solitaire is a variant of Golf Solitaire (that's the official term) which is very similar to Tripeaks anyway.  It's just that Golf and Tripeaks have fixed layouts whereas all the solitaire games we've been making have varying layouts to keep things interesting (and special cards that do other stuff).<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

HO games seem to be basically interactive visual novels, and the `adventure` element is always engrossing.

So I think its not being sexist, but these types of games are an easy way in for non "expert" players. It gives people a way to feel connected to the game playing society we have become! About 20 years ago it was totally different, when I was playing the amiga, nes and other home computer/consoles she never "got" playing the games.

I've added loads of humour and funny characters, and the voiceovers are really cool too.  The main game character is a complete loon (and likes to eat cheese).

I do have some cool stuff from development though - basically my 'idea' for the level select screen which is a god-awful doodle, from that I got a rough sketch from the artist which was about 3,000x better than my scrawl, then to the final artwork.

Paul Thelen is right - casual is not dead, far from it.  It's a much easier, safer and reliable way to make money than indie games or mobile games in my opinion.  BFG is also a very good portal to work with. So are iWin and Real.  Can't say the same for others unfortunately (in terms of either a) revenue or b) them replying to emails).  If you'd have decent success with another, please let me know.<br><br>BlitzMax is basically perfect for making casual games as long as they are 2D, although sometimes I wish I could easy do a few simple 3D effects or mesh type effects.  Anyway, as long as you get all the basic stuff a commercial game needs in your game engine, then spend a bit of money on art and come up with a game in an established casual download genres (HOG/Adventure, Time Management, Solitaire, Match-3 etc.) then you can do pretty well.<br><br>The other key thing is that games have a long shelf-life and even if your game's first year doesn't make you rich, continued income over many years can be pretty good.<br><br><div class="quote"> Grey did you have any involvement with the fairway solitaire that is on BFG now? <br></div>No I didn't.  I was working on a Facebook game at they time in Vancouver so they got another team to make it in Seattle although John Cutter was still involved.  To answer you other question, I believe solitaire games can make more than match-3 as the market is less crowed and they stand a greater chance of getting in the top 10. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Longer exclusive period generally equates to better exposure.  During the exclusive period, the only other place you can sell your game, is on your own website.  After that you can sell it anywhere, with the caveat that BFG now publish to other sites too (i.e. iWin, Oberon) so a game that's on BFG may well get rejected by others if you submit it yourself, as they won't want it on there twice. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I've had plenty of lousy experiences in the past so I just want to write my game, get it out there, and on to the next.  No faffing about.  If I have to take a small loss on that, then so be it.<br><br><div class="quote"> Once you submit something to BFG, how long does it take until your game might go live on their website? <br></div>It depends on a number of factors, I guess.  If you're unknown to a publisher, it's going to take longer.  Your game will go into the evaluation queue and wait it's turn.<br><br>If you've worked with them before and have contacts there, then you basically get to 'sneak your game in via the side door'.  Your contact then will get to look at your game a bit quicker than simply taking a look at whatever's at the front of the eval queue.<br><br>Even so with submission (if you're known to the publisher), contract terms, beta/bug fixing, meeting standards/guidelines eg splash screens, functionality, promotional artwork etc and all the rest of it, I'd say to expect a minimum of around eight to ten weeks.  This is just my experience, others may vary.<br><br>My current game, on it's release date, will oddly enough be nine weeks to the day since it was submitted.  May seem a long time but I'd rather make sure everything's right, because getting a small detail wrong can have a catastrophic impact on sales.  There now follows an anecdote.<br><br>When I released Magicville in 2010, it was released having not been tested on a non-English OS.  Unknown to anybody at the time, the C++ code I was using to set shared folder permissions, failed completely on any version of Windows that wasn't English.  The upshot was that, understandably, I lost a colossal number of sales just because of that.  I fixed the problem very quickly but the damage was done - all the thousands of people who had downloaded in the first few hours of release and couldn't get it to work, probably didn't bother to try again.<br><br>So the moral is that it's better to take a bit of time and get it right, than rush through a release and the whole thing goes tits-up.  Only get one shot at that first impression. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

He's very good. Maarten Van Strien.<br><br>@skn3: The final levels on Fairway Solitaire are much harder, but the problem is,  once you have learned the tricks there is still a large amount of luck to whether you beat a level quickly or it takes many tries. That can be frustrating for some people.<br><br><div class="quote"> If I have to take a small loss on that, then so be it. <br></div>I hear you on the minimal hassle front but what I'm trying to say is it won't be a small loss. Far from it.  Assuming your next card game does as well as therevills last one, you could be throwing away tens of thousands of $ by letting BFG publish on other portals for you.<br><br>When I make a game I make a folder with all the various marketing assets that I know the portals want and a master document of the game information and descriptive text (short, med, long, paragraph etc).  Then it's very easy to make a build for a different portal as I just chuck in a different splash screen and send the a link to my marketing info, or if I have to, fill out their forms with copy/pasted info. With some recent re-launches some of the other portals made me over $20K.  That would have been $7K if BFG published on them.  $13K extra for a small amount of hassle has got to be worth it in anyone's books right? That;s my $0.02 anyway.<br><br>@ImaginaryHuman: I keep a detailed log of hours spent making every game so I can work out $/hour.  Fairway took me over 1000 hours.  I also made a lot of framework improvements during that time which I reused on Unwell Mel and future games. That also includes time spent localising it to 3 languages (F/G/S)<br><br><div class="quote"> For which screen resolution are you developing when you are targeting BFG / IWIN / Gamehouse? The games I played on BFG seemed to run in fullscreen will some kind of Letterboxing. <br></div>My first few games were 800x600 but Spring Bonus was 1024x768 and I'll stick with that for a while.  However, not all monitors will correctly add black bars to the side, so I have some code in there that can do that when players toggle Widescreen on the options screen (thanks therevills!)  Also I scale down the resolution in full screen and windowed if it won't fit on the current display using the Virtual Resolution stuff in Blitz.  You don't have to have any of that stuff to launch a game on BFG but I think it will help make more sales and is nicer for the player.<br><br><div class="quote"> Remember, even with all the infos we got here, no one will automatically create a full featured game and publish it through BFG.

At least in terms of desktops seen from web browsers. It used to be the past few years that 1024x768 was the standard but now that's down to less than 15-20% of users. Yet mobile devices like iPad1/2/mini etc still work at 1024x768. So I think if you can, make your game able to work at both 1280x800/1280x720 and at 1024x768.

As I mentioned before, players don't like to lose - and that's not to say you should make your game stupidly easy because that won't work either.  It needs to offer some level of challenge, and for their efforts, they need to be regularly rewarded.  If the player does happen to fail a level, then you really want to have a 'try again' button so that they can instantly replay the level without the hassle of going back to the level select screen etc.<br><br>My current game has in-game pop-ups for various things congratulating the player etc.  Also I have a trophy/achievement room and the player is notified when they win new trophies.  Trophies they haven't won are only drawn in outline, so they can see how many trophies there are, but won't necessarily know what they're for until they get them, or at least, get one in that cluster of trophies that looks similar.  In addition, they also get an additional 'trophy' for completing a level (a "level" might consist of 4 or 5 solitaire boards).  This trophy then forms part of the level select screen, and players can click on that trophy to revisit and replay earlier levels, adding to the replay factor, as a player does not need to get perfect scores on every board in order to complete a whole level, but it's there as an added achievement if they want to.<br><br>I think it really helps to keep the player curious about what might be coming next, rather than expecting them to play just for the purpose of going through the motions.<br><br>Something I learned from Crime Solitaire - listen to what the players tell you.  After release I really hang around the BFG forums to find out what people are saying.  Obviously it's too late to act on most of what they say but you can take it on-board for future development.  With Crime Solitaire you couldn't replay old levels so having that for my new game was a key point in development.<br><br>&lt;/waffle&gt; <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

All I know is that I lost a lot of sales because of it.

It's not a new thing. It's a sub-genre of the whole solitaire genre.  In fact the different solitaire game types/mechanics play quite differently.<br>- John Cutter and Glen Debiasa, designers at BFG, said hey what if we ACTUALLY make the graphics look like Golf as well so it has Golf mechanics and Golf visuals + extra golf related things (Fairway Solitaire).  This then became a sub-genre of solitaire computer games.  Before that people may have made a plain golf-mechanics solitaire game but there weren't any with the extra features John designed or the Golf visual theme as far as I know.  Now there are lots of solitaire games with golf mechanics and similar extra features to Fairway Solitaire such as a multiplier (with slight variations here and there - I listed all these features in a higher up post) but not with the golf visual theme as that would be too much like cloning/IP infringement and BFG would probably sue.  BFG actually have a patent on the mechanics in Fairway Solitaire that have been copied/modified by other devs, but for now they seem to be letting other devs copy/modify without repercussion.

Golf theme on the cards, the box, fold out mat with holes and markers and players, special bonus cards, regular golf scorecard, etc.  I still play golf solitaire with regular cards and use extra jokers as the bonus cards.  This is why I liked Fairway Solitaire so much, it really reminded me of one of my favorite games from when I was a kid.

It's sort of an artistic thing I guess. But like so many people are saying, most of the time you can't do what you want and get paid well. So now I'm starting to think about making the kind of games that other people might like that I might not necessarily like, and trying to figure out if there is enough enjoyment in that to continue with it. Like others I'd love to make enough money from some small projects to be able to `fund` something closer to what I want to do. But it's all a learning curve. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Something that has become apparent to me over the past years is that while `people` would certainly seem to be humanly different, complex, emotional, moody, each having their own opinions and preferences and so on, when you look at the numbers `on average`, you really see an overall trend in how many people are willing to get to the point of placing an order. Statistically speaking, and from analyzing the numbers and conversion rates, it seems overall that you can almost think of an audience as this giant nebulous single entity which has a given threshold or percentage of willingness to order. Obviously certain factors make that threshold move such as prime shopping seasons (black friday, cyber monday, pre-christmas etc), but you can still end up with an average for how much willingness there is to purchase.<br><br>So then that leads to the idea - what happens if I make a small change that improves the website/product/service - what happens is you may see that conversion rate increase a little bit. Now you might think that this `little bit` of improvement is unlikely to be measurable because it almost suggests that people are really not as unique and different as we usually think. It almost suggests that `as a whole`, people collectively have certain thresholds and overall the number of people who tip over their threshold and decide to spend can increase. At first it may be just a few extra people who go a little further than before. So then it makes you think, well what if I improve my product/service a little bit more, will I get a better overall conversion rate? And the answer is yes. Again it might be that the improvement leads to just a few more people going ahead and buying. It seems odd, and makes people seem ever-so predictable, but I see this happening again and again.<br><br>So like when it comes to getting people to buy a game, let's say that as it stands your game gets a given conversion rate i.e. the ratio of the number of people who see it/download it versus how many actually pay for it. Whatever that rate is, it gives you an average threshold at which people are converting their attention into sales. I believe that gives good reason to say that some percentage of pirates or people seeking free copies of games can be `persuaded` to go ahead and pay for the game. Just as in an election for example, politicians do what they can to present their case and try to persuade more people to take their side. Obviously some people in the extreme are either extremely willing to buy or extremely willing to pirate/resist a purchase. But in the middle there definitely is a more gray area with fence-sitters who may just need a little extra nudge to tip them over into a sale, and in fact there can be a lot of people in that area who can be persuaded towards a sale if you put a lot more effort into doing so. It really comes down to how you go about that and whether it's successful - which is something that you need to be measuring and analyzing and getting real test data back from - the numbers don't lie.<br><br>I think this is partly why there is now a big movement towards including analytics in games, which monitor and report back on user behavior, how long it takes for people to complete tasks, where they get held up, how many `convert` to buy an in-game add-on, what path people take through the game, who avoids what, etc... that's a tonne of data that can be used to give a realistic picture of where your game is getting in its own way. So then you can iterate based on that data and come up with a better product, which is exactly what millions of website folk do every day to increase their conversion rates. If your game isn't a fine-tuned e-commerce machine that's been optimized for sales and not designed well and keeps putting people off, it will show in the numbers even to a very subtle degree... so there is definitely a lot of scope there for improvement that IS under your control, because you CAN make a better product when you have good data to base your changes on, and that means you CAN get some of those `pirates` to turn into actual new sales, and so that means that YES you do lose some sales to pirates because some of those people WOULD pay for your game if you presented it in the right way. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You then need to change your business model and put something in the full pirated game that provides an upgrade path or extra add-ons or advertisement or whatever to help redirect the flow toward some form of payment. What you're saying is you are really really sure that people will go to the search engines and be met with a search result that's higher/more appealing than the one for your own website (which partly suggests the SEO for your own website sucks), then you should acknowledge that this `behavior` is commonplace and adjust your business approach to accommodate it rather than dig in your heals with an out of date business model.<br><br>There was a game which the author released `to pirate sites` for free including pirate hats or other pirate-related game elements, which the pirates found intriguing and caused some of them to buy copies of the game. That this approached worked (to some extent) makes me wonder why more people haven't picked up this approach for their games.<br><br>Moral of the story - you can't change other people or make them stop behaving a certain way, but YOU can change how YOU respond to it.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I don't think someone looking for a pirate copy is a lost sale, but I do worry that people who are searching for the game and hoping to find my site might get distracted by the pirate links and never find my site (or valid portals), so sales could be lost that way.  Plus, it's just damn RUDE that pirate links push legitimate sites where you can buy it down the listing.  I wonder if the owners of these sites have jobs and how'd they'd like it if someone turned up at their work and said to their boss, "I'll do that guy's job for free" and the boss said OK.

If you aren't succeeding in getting ranked highly enough then there's something wrong with your website and SEO approach. If people tying in `download Holiday Bonus Pirate` or whatever aren't bringing up your website then you need to make a nice landing page to capture that traffic, ie to be more relevant to the type of searches people are doing.
