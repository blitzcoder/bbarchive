XandrOS is very similar to Windows (the usage of Alt-Tab and Windows Key for example), which was part of CorelLinux that was even brought far further in XandrOS.<br><br>I think XandrOS 4, which is said to be comming in the near future, will show the distinction even better. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Might be time to get over it now.<br><br>The problem relates to what are considered derivative works of the Kernel.  According to Torvalds, if a driver module requires a Kernel patch to work, then it is intimate with the Kernel and therefore would very likely be derivative.  <br><br>In most other cases though, loadable Kernel modules would NOT be considered derivative.  This is especially true of most 3rd party drivers ported from other systems, since as ports by definition they cannot be considered as derived from the Linux kernel.<br><br>Basically the issue is that certain GPL zealots choose to interpret the licence and exclusions in the Kernel source in particular ways, which do not seem to mirror the intent of Linus himself (who has stated he does not wish to make judgements on such gray areas as this.)  At any rate the issue is likely to remain legally untested (and probably not enforceable) so I doubt we will ever see anything come of it.<br><br>There are also many ways around the issue if it was pressed.  This is indeed how NVidia have chosen to work with the Kernel, although because their drivers are derived from Windows versions it's not even necessary for them. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
