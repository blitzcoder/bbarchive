A real compiler is capable of taking any programming language and turn it into another programming language... whether that be machine specific assembly, or p-code, or what-ever.  A real compiler will use a grammar to direct it on doing the translation.  I am going to "attempt" to create my own "grammar" template so I can allow this program to interperate many different basic dialects.  Being that 90% of most basic langauages in the last 30 years are more or less the same, it will allow for a very diverse input of source code.<br><br>Of course I will have to decide, almost from the beginning, what graphics options I'm going to incorporate into the program, as well as sound.  I will also have to figure out if I'm going to create my own font and print display, or try to use "LIBTCOD" to simplify most of the printing.  (Brucey is having difficulty with libtcod, so I believe I'll have to write my own....)<br><br>Obviously any programs (C64 is a good example) that try to employ assembly routines will have to be converted with TODO: sections, or just abort the compile.<br><br>My MAIN objective (#1 priority) at this point should be obvious:  To create a compiler that can take all "standard" basic commands into BlitzMax source.  This would include such basic commands as the following:<br><br>ABS, AND, ASC, ATN, CLS, COLOR, COS, DATA, DEF FN, DIM, END, FOR..NEXT, GET, GOSUB, GOTO, IF..THEN..ELSE, INPUT, INT, KEY, LEFT$, LEN, LET, LOG, MID$, MOD, NOT, ON..GOSUB, ON..GOTO, OR, PRINT, RND, REM, RESTORE, RETURN, RIGHT$, SIN, SPC, SQR, TAB, TAN, TIME$, VAL, XOR<br><br>This is not a extensive list, or course.<br><br>I've never really been too interested in graphics, but more in the functions, techniques, logic, and restrictions of a particular language.  It has been suggested that BlitzMax is not "capable" or "suited" for certain programming efforts.  Well, I suppose I could agree with the basic concept, that certain tasks "MAY" be better in another programming language... But to say that something "can't" be done, or "shouldn't" be done, is absurd.  That is the whole point behind programming in the first place.  To take the fight against the limitations and make something greater than anyone thought possible.<br><br>I find that a lot of the "new" programmers in the last 10 years have very much come to depend on the programming language/IDE to do everything for them.  The constraints of memory, disk space/speed, graphics limitations of scale and color... they all have more or less been forgotten.  Too many new programmers that believe they are so smart don't have a clue what it means to program under limitations.<br><br>Sorry for the diatribe, guess I got a little carried away.<br>:) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It sounds like you will have fun doing it, and will learn a lot.<br><br>As for the whole "should I reinvent the wheel or not" debate, and about programming in limitations, I don't think there is a single fit-all answer. There are three important factors to consider: learning, result and fun. Different people have different priorities on these factors, which is why there is so much disagreement about it.<br><br>Learning - if you're programming to learn, then reinventing the wheel is a good way to learn how things work.<br>Result - if you're programming to make money, or produce a working product as quick as possible, reinventing the wheel is a waste of time.<br>Fun - Do you like reinventing the wheel? Then do it! Or don't, if you don't like it.<br><br>Before, while I was learning programming, I wanted to do everything myself, my way. It was good for learning, but it was difficult for me to actually complete a working project. Now, I've decided I want to program to create finished, distributable (perhaps sellable) products, so I'm going from learning to result, and trying to use whatever 3rd party modules I can, to get the nitty gritty out of the way and get an actual game polished and finished quickly and efficiently.<br><br>In summary, consider your own situation and needs, and what you would consider the most FUN xD <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
