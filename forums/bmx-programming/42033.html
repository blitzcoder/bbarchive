Ask Microsoft or ESA/Elspa and they will tell you that next after the PlayStation, Windows is the single most pirated platform in the world. Look at all the rediculous copy protection schemes that have emergerd recently. Just because there is a handful of honest Windows users doesn't mean everyone is.<br>Secondly Windows-buyers are also generally opposed to developing software. Been to "The Party" or "The Gathering" lately? Notice how many people there produce somethingf as opposed to how many people just come to play LAN games. Remember what it was like 15 years ago? Mac owners on the other hand are creative by nature. I don't know why, but the Mac just has a broader appeal to artistic types, and even tho' many creativity programs have found their way to the PC the Macintosh (and Silly Graphics) is still the platform of choice for art studios and advertisemnet professionals.<br><br>So how big is the Windows market really? Yes it's true that the various Windows platforms are used by probably 85% of everyone who has a computer. That however does not nessecarilly make the Windows market the most lucrative, because not everyone is a potential customer. The kind of person who is likely to buy BlitzMAX has to fit a very specific profile, one I might add that in my personal experience isn't very common amoungst Windows users.<br><br><div class="quote"> - Someome always polite no matter what is being thrown at them<br>- Someone who can reply fast and individually if possible<br>- Someone who answers mail  <br></div>I believe James fits the bill on all three of the above.<br><br><div class="quote"> - Mark as head programmer should update his worklog at least once a week and use half an hour at the start of every workday to address the community <br></div>I disagree.

Software design is not something you can do in a commision, and especially not as large a commision as the Blitz community with as conflicting interests as we have here (not if you ever want to ship a product).
