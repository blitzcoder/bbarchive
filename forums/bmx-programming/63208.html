On $800 per year I don't think I would be able to afford a computer at all and would probably do something else in life.<br><br>And yes, Shawn, we do have running water and electricity. :-) And we were using personal computers at the same time when the west was using them. I was programming IBM and HP mainframes way back in the early 70's and purchased my KIM-1 single board computer only a month after it was available in Germany. There was a small problem of smuggling personal computers into the country because communust government in its eternal wisdom did not allow people to import them but it just made it more fun. Smuggling various goods from the west was a national pasttime then... ;-)<br><br>Actuaally... it is rather sobering when one thinks of all the people on this planet who are surviving on far less than $800 per year.

I think you guys have a completely wrong picture regarding car usage in Croatia. Obviously we can't compare to the US (1 to 1 ratio) but when I drive around it looks like everyone has a car and here in Zagreb the traffic congestion is just as bad as in any western city. Liter of petrol is around $1.50 and it never stopped us driving. :-)<br><br>And to answer Swifty's questions:<br><br>- The $800 I've mentioned was after taxes. It's much easier to discuss salaries that way as you don't have to worry about different tax groups. Taxes are 15%, 25%, 35% and 45%.<br><br>- 1BR appartment would be considered two rooms apartment here and rent would be somewhere around $500. A single room apartment would cost you between $250-$350 depending on the location and age of the apartment. But you can't look at it from the same perspective as in the US. It's quite common to find up to three family generations to live in te same house or larger apartment and you must take into account that a lot of people are house owners so renting is actually the least prefered way of living here<br><br>- I've already mentioned cars but to answer your question: yes, average person owns a car and you'll be amazed at the number of German produced cars running around<br><br>- My commute is only about 10 minutes by car and 20 minutes if I take a tram. Which one I'll use depends solely on how I feel that particular day or what I have to do. Trams are quick and nice way of travelling the city if you use them outside rush hours. Otherwise be prepared to feel like a sardine in a (very) tight can :-) If you are unlucky enough to live at one side of Zagreb and have to commute all the way to the other side during the rush hour, expect a travelling time of an hour.<br><br>- Quick meals will cost you anything between $3-$10. A decent restaurant meal will cost you $7-$20. After that, anything goes. In some restaurants you can easily pay $50 or more, especially if you drink bottled wines.<br><br>Barney <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'm sure that some minor googling will unearth a ton of horror stories from people that tried exactly that, and failed miserably.<br><br>Will you fail too? Not necesarily, but it <i>is</i> a major gamble, and not something you should think of lightly. As with any private business, you better make sure you have all your ducks in a row: have a solid business plan, realistic expecations, and be prepared to work your behind off. (That's all assuming you do indeed have what it takes, and can consistently create 'fun', high quality games)<br><br>Keep in mind that even if you are successful  it will still take a significant time before your investments (time, effort, money) will pay off -- so think long and hard before quitting your job chasing this dream -- more than likely, you'll depend on it to pay your rent, food, internet, etc. for a considerable time.<br><br>However, if you ARE seriously committed to making this work, you could look into how much money you actually need to make ends meet, and see what you can do with that. Maybe you can switch to a part-time job, making just enough money to pay your way while also freeing up additional time to dedicate to your programming endeavours... Personally I'd try to get a good head start on things while having a full-time job on the site though -- have a steady, reliable income, and possibly also be able to put money to the side for when you need if you DO take the plunge later on.<br><br>Just keep realistic, and consider the worst-case scenarios as well. Like they say, most business fail in their first year of operation... and I have a gut feeling that that percentage is conssiderably higher among indie game creators. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
