So I figure you'd have to analyse the sequence and try to come up with a `formulae` reproduces the sequence, and this formulae, with a given seed value, would then describe the sequence in question and could regenerate it.<br><br>This is just an idea for data compression. If you can take random data, pictures, files, whatever, and extract a seed and a formula from a small piece of it, that could regenerate it exactly, it would be a really good form of compression. You'd have to probably work on only a short sequence at a time, though.<br><br>I think it's too much variability to figure out the possible formulas and reverse them, too much math, and too much time. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The difficulty, of course, is knowing what seed value is going to give you the best results and to do that you'd need to go through each random seed value, generate n values and then when doing your compression compare the sequence you've got and look for the longest set of values produced by one of the seeds.<br><br>In order for it to be more efficient all you need is for the sequence of values to be longer than the size of the three ints above, what's that 12 bytes?  Not too bad.  Any sequence of 12 bytes that you can't match just put in as it is.<br><br>Then all you need to do is go the list of values and generate a data file.<br><br>The main problem I'd guess, as discussed a number of times before, is different puters producing different values from the random function.<br><br>Goodbye.<br><br>Jes <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The only place where compression stops is where the input byte total is the same as the amount of bytes to store a single code.<br><br>I did try using Max's Rand() function with incrementing seeds, but in an hour-long run period, it only at best found a match for a TWO byte sequence. I tried varying the start point of the seed, it didn't find it at all. Obviously lots depends on the formula.<br><br>I think the random compressor thing is possible but I dont see a very fast way of finding the matches.
