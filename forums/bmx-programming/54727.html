Here the BlitzMAX version is roughly 3 times faster than the BlitzBasic version. Add to that the BlitzMAX version is working on 4 times as large a buffer (480x480 rather than 240x240), and drawing twice as many pixels (as opposed to the BlitzBasic version which only draws every other pixel), and doesn't have an unrolled main loop.<br><br><div class="quote"> If you only have a few hundred particles, you only get a bit of purple. <br></div>Yeah. You need a few thousand. Should get them within a few secs. I'm thinking the culprit here is your 1GHz P3 not being able to do its thing in the ammount of time it's given. Should probably have at least a 2GHz Pentium class processor or better for decent results.<br><br><div class="quote"> You'll have to explain to me how these things have anything to do with a particle's lifespan. ;) (That's what I'm guessing is the problem) <br></div>The code does quite alot of read/writes to and from system memory. It keeps generating more particles as long as the main loop takes less than a certain threshold to execute.<br><br>Apart from "you're running a debug version" (which adds massive overhead), I can't imagine what could possibly cause such a dramatic loss of performance. I've tested it on both the GeForce Go 6800 and Radeon X600XT and both cap out well above 25K particles for the BlitzMAX version. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
