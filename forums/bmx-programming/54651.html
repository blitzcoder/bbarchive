It's something I used to enjoy a lot but haven't done for many years.  Before very recently, the last time I worked on game development was games written in assembly language on the Commodore 64 and in pascal (swapping floppies to compile) on the Apple II.  <br><br>I probably had time to devote 20 hours total to b3d due to being overbooked with asp.net clients for the past year.  That was barely enough time to even learn the basics of b3d, much less do anything productive in it before Bmax came out.  Being primarily a java and C# architect/developer for a living, of course I bought the more OO Bmax when it came out.  It's only very recently that I lessened my client load and started having enough spare time to actually use either one in a productive fashion.  I bought what I perceived as the most advanced product available at the time I bought b3d, but most definitely had I known that a more OO product would be available within a year that was not considered an upgraded version of the current flagship product I would not have bought it.  I'm sure the future Bmax product was probably well-known long ago by people who dwell in these forums, but people who aren't members of these forums can't even do searches here.  Obviously, I hadn't been active in the gaming community for many years so was not privvy to insider info, either.<br><br>As I said before, that is water passed under the bridge and doesn't really matter now.  Anyway, Lenn, it really seems in both of your posts that you're just trying to dig for no reason and bait further argument, so I don't see any reason to comment in this thread any further.
