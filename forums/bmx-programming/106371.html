You can use IncBinPtr and IncBinLen to get the information necessary from the file in memory.<br><br>But this leads to another point that I think supersedes all of this: should you really be worrying about adding functionality to a game engine?<br>- I assume you want to make a game. You have a game design, characters, a story. You don't want to keep modifying tools, you want to make your game exist and move on.<br>- At this moment in time there is no convenient way to get animated models exported to the B3D format. This is like a major red flag. The only way to get animated 3D content to use in your game is unavailable.<br><br>If you look at what commercial engines (be them free or not) do, they have what is called an 'asset pipeline', a convenient way for you to get 3D content from major sources (Maya, Blender etc.) into the engine.<br><br>You need to be very selfish about the tool that you use, you need to demand the best from it, because time is your most precious asset.<br>If the tool doesn't give you a fair return for the time you invested then there is something wrong.<br>It makes more sense to me to learn a whole different framework and language that already have this functionality (and all the other functionalities) that you will need to get your game to exist.

Now, I think I like you is happening in epaquetar aspect of the game files in BlitzMaz , but eventually is a learning process with an excuse to make a video game, but I guess that 's the fun .
