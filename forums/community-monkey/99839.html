There's that hype-is-it-worth-it that comes to mind, there's alot of multiplatofrms now thats the true hype thing to have, most are bad glue with missing. Appcelerator (price per period I think... way too much), app.js and monkey is up there so far for us, but app.js has same as Blitzmax, no mobile, not yet, so its a nono. With you on Monkey, and been thinking a long time. The perfect platform langauge would be web itself, js which has, its and amazing lanaguge and platform when its useed correctly, but its not there yet. Monkey is the best seen so far. Missing things such as opengl 2.0 shaders.. and all native things in platforms... <br><br>Thanks, and appriciating every input <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The language is far better and it's very open and easy to integrate with thirdparty modules. Also, current experimental version should bring some platform specific things to the party, and make targetting plaforms even easier.<br>Also, to the saving data issue Gfk was mentioned, the save based on strings is the true cross plaform way to do it, including html5 on a browser, but you can use the os module to write real files on the os when using a c++ based target such as GLFW, so in case you're developing for the desktop and willing to support file I/O operations, you can do it out of the box.<br><br>The only 2 things I miss is a way to toggle full screen on/off in GLFW and a DX driver for windows, but this is arguabe, as there's a specific windows 8 target on latest version, wich uses the DX windows 8 API for its rendering, so it's sort of solved.<br><br>Also, it's hard to believe that BlitzMax will take the ARM route anytime soon, while this could be trivial for Monkey. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So if you already own BlitzMax, going to monkey does not mean loosing anything, you can add some final bits on BlitzMax (like device configuration) to the game, and leave the rest on Monkey for the sake of being portable to almost anywhere. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The MonkeyMax target let's you use BlitzMAx instead of GLFW. There is already a MiniB3D module which supports D3D11 I read. Again, the flexibility that Monkey provides, is pure Gold. If you are after something that caters you 100% and you are willing to wait for its creator to release new updates, then go with BLitzMax or AGK imho. But we know that BlitzMAX is not getting any new functionality atm. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
