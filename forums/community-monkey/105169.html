Making good progress on my framework. ;)<br><br>Hi,<br><br>I have had a bout with illness (last month or so, all well now) which cut into development, but back on track. :) I have been finalizing my GUI architecture which is a huge factor in designing my gaming framework as it handles quite a lot from managing windows and GUI components to supporting a window draw list that manages text, images and mojo2 rendering. I am happy to say that it is all working awesomely and is 'Very' efficient with each window supporting an Independent list of buttons and GUI components as well as a draw list (draw images, text and mojo2 render). This and other consideration in design make this GUI perfect for gaming. As it stands now the core architecture is well defined and functioning well so it is now time to flesh out the GUI components.<br><br><b>List Boxes and Menus</b><br>Below are a few screen shots of list boxes used in the GUI. I have reworked my code to support '4' images per button, one for up, down, highlight and selected. This makes for really detailed and flexible buttons especially when supported by framework commands like SetHighlightColor(), SetHighlightAlpha(), SetHighlightBlend() and alike. Each button (or list box element) can have a separate button image for all four states of action as well as '4' states of color, blend and alpha. In the first list box image below you can see the highlight element in the list box using BlendMode.Additive as well as a custom color and alpha. When it comes to list boxes you can customize list box button elements as a group or individually and this even extends to changing individual list box button element images. So the up shot here is list boxes are very customizable as well as buttons and sliders.<br><br>I will be using the list box class to support menus. As it stands now list boxes can have a slider on the left or right or no slider at all. So with some small modifications the list box class can support a menu class. The plan is to support at least a first level slider option for menus which may extent to sub-menus. Since the list boxes provide support for element images menus should really function and look sweet. I should add that the GUI loads a resource file to 'skin' and initialize. So all of the GUI components (buttons, list boxes, sliders, more) are ready to go with all of the default color, blend, alpha and images. This allows for a overall theme and lots of customization.<br><br><img src="http://www.phoenixusc.com/Personal_Post_Data/newlistbox1.jpeg"><br><b>This list box (over rendered mojo2 scene) uses customized color, alpha, blend for its button elements. The slider is also customized using list box framework commands (alpha, color, blend). Shown in cursor highlight state.</b><br>.<br><br><img src="http://www.phoenixusc.com/Personal_Post_Data/newlistbox2.jpeg"><br><b>This is a list box using the default skin and framework values. Shown in cursor highlight state.</b><br>.<br><br><img src="http://www.phoenixusc.com/Personal_Post_Data/newlistbox3.jpeg"><br><b>Also using the default skin but shown with the cursor element state in the mouse/button down state. Each button (or list box element) has '4' images for each button (or list box element) state as well as the color, alpha and blend states.</b><br>.<br><br>So I still have a lot to do but I am in the home stretch as it were. With the core architecture firmly in place fleshing out the rest of the GUI components will happen quickly. After I have menus and a list box view in place I will move on to a text area component which will allow in game editing and so much more. <br><br>Off to code.<br>- Rich - <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I have a little screen icon (you can see upper right background screen) which when clicked will cast that window to the background. You can think of it as sort of a bottom-most window (really a bit more complicated). Once cast all other windows will appear above it and work normally. Clicking on the cast window (background screen) activates it and all the GUI components will work normally (with all other windows above the cast window). Super cool and so right for gaming. I'll have a video up here in a day or two (soon) which should give you a good idea of how this works. <br><br>I'm also exploring virtual screens and I think I can make that happen code wise. Anyway, I was so exited casting worked I had to post about it. <br><br>Off to code,<br>- Rich - <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

</textarea><br><br>I also have the background screen casting feature working well and it really solves many issues regarding managing windows. Casting windows to the background is just a sweet feature. It allows any window to be cast full-screen to the background screen and automatically stops drawing the occluded scripted background screen images for efficiency. The same occlusion efficiency is done for maximized windows where any open window is not updated or drawn while occluded. I will have a video of this up shortly here. :) <br><br>I thought I would mention that at some point I want to make this framework available to my fellow Monkey coders (cost? not sure yet). So if you are a fan of what I'm up to you will be able to use this framework for your applications and games. I am planning to release the GUI framework first as it is the core architecture for the gaming framework and it manages all of the graphic user interface, background screen, windows and more and works seamlessly with mojo2 and Monkey (got to love native coded frameworks). Also I believe that this framework is flexible enough to work with existing gaming frameworks (although I have never tried any of them :O ). I will be fleshing out more about how to code for Alien Phoenix and sharing more about it's flexibility along the way. There is so much that this framework does I will have to lay it all out in several posts.<br><br>Personally I am very happy with the results and once finished, I believe you will not find a better, more efficient, flexible and capable GUI framework (gaming) for Monkey-X anywhere (not even third party). :D <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The way MX2 is going to handle certain aspects of memory/data will improve things quite a bit. I will 'go out on a limb' here I guess and project MX2's performance regarding mojo2 will be twice as fast/efficient then it is now with the removal of certain bottlenecks to architecture. I should point out that this framework is being developed in MX1 while I wait on MX2 and it will all be converted to MX2.<br><br>Fortunately all of the above lighting can be faked a bit by rendering it, capturing the scene in tiles (or whatever) and displaying those in a map as a static lighting scene (no lighting just a pre-rendered lighted scene). Something I will support as this framework is up to the challenge. In fact you can see this framework running with no problems (no real-time lighting) on mobile in the first video listed in this thread.<br><br>My point on the 12% CPU load (it's actually lower then that) is that the framework is 'very' efficient and in 'no way' is a factor in bottlenecking development. In fact this is the fastest, most efficient GUE (more then a GUI now) I have ever used with any BRL product by far not to mention capable of features not seen here and all in native code.<br><br>I believe that this framework on MX2 will be surprising in it's mobile lighting/rendering performance. ;)<br><br>- Rich - <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Although I am not pushing it very hard it is performing. The only real issue is the lack of a method to return the collision normal which I would think is solvable. You will also, it appears. have to layer collision. Aside from that it has preformed well and I am still exploring how and what it does. Right now I am able to support two separate scenes with independent collision, impact and other lighting. The AP (Alien Phoenix) framework does support any number of renderer and layer instances.<br><br>The lighting for the collision impacts is using two lights which pulls off a nice lighted impact effect (looks sweet) in real-time. It is quite convincing and the shadow casters really add to the effect of lighted impacts. I have impact animated sprites also showing as part of the the impact effect. So the impact effect is a combination of an animated sprite and a light underneath. Looks just great in real-time and I will have a video up shortly.<br><br>I will be doing more prototyping to reveal the best path forward for lighting, mapping and collision, but I think things are off to a good start. <br><br>Off to code,<br>- Rich - <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In the video I have 5 layers of map spaces all moving at different speeds (velocities) with the larger asteroids (top most layer) moving (inversely) 80% of the player speed and the mid-size asteroids at 65% of player speed and so on. The lighted layer is an additional map space. Together I can achieve a parallax view using this method.<br><br>Map spaces are at the basic level a tree map with an array of nodes that branch to other arrays of nodes. So one root level node branches into an array of child nodes with each representing the display dimensions. From my point of view it is sort of a lookup tree (think lookup table - old school) where I lookup what elements (leaf items/collection) are in the child node based on the players position. So managing layers of map spaces is easy to do as basically all you have to do is create a map space, add items (elements) to it and then draw the map space (which manages what to draw based on position). In pseudo code it would look something like this to set up and use a map space.<br><br><pre class=code>
'Initialize 
map_base:PMap=New PMap  'Pmap is the main mapping class
map_base.CreateMapTree(32,32,32,32,1280,720)   
'CreateMapTree - (root array width, root array height, cell array width, cell array height, cell display width, cell display height)


'Add items in this case images
For Local mapc:Int=0 To 500000
     map_base.AddMapItem( my_image, Rnd(200000), Rnd(200000) )   '(image, position x, position y)
Next

'Draw the map space
map_base.DrawMap(player_x, player_y, window)
'DrawMap - (player position x, player position y, Alien Phoenix window to draw to)
</pre><br>Soon I will be using map part objects instead of images when adding elements to the map space. Each map part object contains all the information needed to provide an image, collision data (if needed) and other information to the mapping system that will be used to essentially copy data from the part object to the map systems tree map. If the map space uses collision then a return from a method or function will indicate a collision has occurred. So drawing a map space with collision enabled as say the top most layer (generally the player level) will allow for collision interactions. <br><br>I am still fleshing out the best ways to approach collision and ways of making the map space dynamic, for example including player objects. As it is now the player/actor object is 'not' part of the map space and I am testing out methods to include player/actors and see what results I get. It should be possible to include hundreds of player/actor objects and potentially thousands of bullet style objects within the map space and support collision for them. Still, it may turn out that it is more efficient to use the map system to compare a player/actors positions to a map cell and the collection within.<br><br>So the basic takeaway here is that you can have lots of map spaces, you can layer them and the map spaces that have collision enabled will provide player/actor collision.<br><br><br><div class="quote"> drawing 1 million map elements simultaneously is the interesting part, not managing them (except handling them _all_ regardless of distance to player) <br></div><br>This is done by looking up the child node cell (based on position) and then getting a list (array) of elements (images and positions in this case) in that cell. I include neighbouring cells (each cell represents the display dimensions) for a total of 9 from which I extrapolate which map elements to display.

This means each laser, bullet, bomb and alike has it's own inertia physics and can be effected by the ship's (ship firing it) speed (velocity) and angle. Essentially if the ship is standing still it will shoot bullet entities as you might see in a stock shump but in a SubSpace style game each bullet entity has it's own inertia physics which adds to the skill and fun. Each physics object loads it's own configuration file with variables on how to act when initialized and can be changed to act in an inertia style or a non-inertia manner. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Even with them not in the map I still have three map space layers (asteroids) going over a static background and it is pretty cool to play around with and has a very nice look and feel.

The map system now uses a parts system that manages all parts for the map system. What is a part? It is an object that holds all of the data needed to be added to the map systems as a map element. So a part object would include the image, alpha, blend, color, collision data and more. The part system loads two text files which hold this data and below are example of the data in these text files. With these two files a part can be described and defined as a part object and then can be used throughout the map as map elements. I'll explain more on this later but the basic idea here is you define part objects and then place or add them to the map space (you can have lots of map spaces or layers).<br><br>I also wanted to mention about the frameworks efficiency and performance. In the above video (post #40) you can see the mapping system running in a full-screen (maximized) window. In that mode the CPU usage on my 3.8ghz quad core is 3% (yes that little) and in the multiple window mode (3 windows in view) the CPU usage is 11%. These kinds of CPU usage numbers are what you need to have a shot at mobile devices. I believe I can reduce the higher 11% number down a little bit further which means CPU usage is not a factor when using this framework and mobile devices.<br><br>As soon as I have the collision aspect of the part and map systems going (very close to having it working) I will post a video of the Alien Phoenix framework running on an Android tablet using the 'exact' same map and 'window based' GUE as is on the PC. Looking around the net I have not seen anything like my approach and if things continue to workout as well as they have this framework will provide the first truly seamless window based GUE/GUI for PC and mobile. This should be noteworthy and I may put together a simple shoot'em up style space game to test the reaction to this unique and useful gaming framework. I think it's cool of course, but I hope others do too. :)<br><br>Part data file.<br><textarea class=codebox name="code" wrap=OFF readonly="true" rows="15" cols="80">

It works nicely on Android and in full screen mode runs at 60FPS. The mapping system now supports collision and although for now it is pretty simple I will be adding vector rotation to it and other needed features. I had to roll-my-own to get the performance I was looking for. So far I am happy with the frameworks performance on mobile and given the features provided by the GUE there is really nothing like it. :)<br><br>Be sure to checkout the last part of the video to see window on window views. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So they were rendered with a fixed "camera setup" or "perspective". The nearer you are to an object, the more the to element's look should change (things should get hidden by nearer portions of the element, some others should get exposed.<br>This is normally not obvious for "cartoon sprites" (which is why parallax works that nice there) but the more "realistic" things get (with baked shadow/lightning in the image) the more your eyes and brain will recognize the whole thing as being "faked".<br><br>I do not have an idea how to circumvent this problem now (except putting many things "far away" - or to have multi-angle-renderings of all sprites).<br><br><br>Again to "expecting real-world-physics": _I_ do not expect something from _your_ game/engine - it is _your_ child and it is up to you to decide what and when and how things happen. I am just trying to express my thoughts on this - with the potential possibility to help your project to improve.<br><br><br>@ 1280x720<br>Do you use batch sprite optimization or so (minimizing texture switches) or sprite atlases (doing the same)? Especially with many GUI-elements (and stretchable 9patch-sprites + Text [even Bitmapfont-text to save on texture switches]) I see framerating being limited a bit in BlitzMax/myEngine/myGame.<br>Am not knowing about the performance of my game on android, but think Brucey once stated it run on his mobile device once he introduced "polledInput"-adjustments (I stored all key-states on each update, "KeyHit()" etc. polled the system each time, resulting in low performance on that mobile device)<br><br><br>I saw that your tablet uses software keys (that "buttons" on the bottom for "back", "context menu", "volume") - I saw that some apps are able to remove them or to style that background - this might allow more screen occupation but honestly: no clue how to achieve that now.<br><br><br>@Performance<br>If you add "sound", make sure you do not load the music as wav into it (memory) - think Monkey offloads its work to the "mediaplayer" library. For BMX-NG you might better play a bit with "bah.mod/soLoud.mod" and "streams" as the default SDL-audio-module only allows for a single stream.<br>I know, audio is not a matter for you now -  but somewhen this is included too.<br><br><br><br><br>I know that I repeat myself over and over but I do not know whether you have read my posts in other threads too:<br>Do not get me wrong when only writing about things "to improve" or "looking odd imho". It is easy to write "looks nice", "gorgeous graphics", "well done" - but this only improves on motivation (which should nonetheless be high if you do things "for joy and fun"). To improve the project, people should come up with some kind of feedback. As I can only judge from looking at the screens/vids I am kind of limited to visual or logical-related feedback.<br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The differences in the two make it difficult to maintain two code bases.
