In other words there have been trolls who put in a pledge and then reduce or remove it at the end of the month and put it back again at the beginning of the next month (or until the bill area has been processed)<br><br>Patreon is not a set amount, it goes up or down and there is no guarantee that amount is what you get until the end of the month. What if (for example) Mark gets 1000 dollars for 2 months and then it drops below 1000, or that person drops their 500, will he stop working on the 3D module, or abandon it if the total goes under 1000? Will he wait until it gets over 1000 again before resuming work on it? None of this is known yet, and since Mark has stayed away from 3D for almost a decade now, I just hope he is up to the job.<br><br>Also, I hope the amount goes even higher and not down, but 1000 dollars from 70 people, that's quite a lot of money from so few patreons. Time will tell anyway.<br><br>I hope Mark starts simple and works his way up, get simple 3D and loading in meshes in first, shaders, networking and some of the other stuff he mentions in his post, he should leave those out for now. Start simple and build stuff up. Don't do a Max3D if all I am hoping.<br><br>PS That 1000 dollars is before Patreon fees and taxes for your relevant country.

There is SO much time that is utterly wasted having to do everything by manual programming, things which 'tools' succeed in making extremely easy. Plus then when you use a tool you can adjust things, tweak things, experiment, and iterate, and be inspired, far faster than having to go into code all over again to write yet another version of specifics. Really, times have moved WAY on past developing games and apps in 'a programming language'. That was like 10 years ago. BRL doesn't need a shinier happier programming language, or more platforms.<br><br>Monkey has been developed as a half-decent platform back-end to abstract away the hardware. It should be left as that. And then on top of it should sit a fully-featured WYSIWYG visual editing tool where you can actually build and edit and test the game close to realtime. Far more time can then be spend on artistic design endeavors and less time on "having to" program yet another huge piece of engine code, or trying to strap on someone's buggy 3D module, or writing another whole entire sybsystem by hand.<br><br>That's extremely old-school development by todays standards. Giving Monkey a 3D module should only be done as a way to have a 3D-supporting back-end to a visual editor, wherein you assemble the 3D game in the editor. You can really imagine ever making any kind of significant 3D game FROM CODE? Any kind of game? You've got to be kidding me. You want to spend a year writing your own 3D engine? Or 6 months trying to implement physics? Or.... like, how exactly are you going to design and implement all of the data that goes into an entire 3D game level of any sophistication?<br><br>You HAVE to have a visual editor. BRL needs to look at what actually is involved in developing a game now... and ... hint.... it's not about programming. Programming should be a last resort to do advanced stuff that you can't do visually and intuitively. Think of the huge amount of time that you'll save having an editor. And... yes. you can program your own editor... from scratch.... in very long extensive code.... over a very long period of time. Have fun with that.<br><br>The fact now is that most developers (using other systems etc) who want to make games have become used to a higher-level workflow, with easy-to-use game editors and user interfaces. This is normal now, for 2D and 3D systems. It is a huge oversight that Blitz doesn't have this. Development has far more parts to it than just writing programs and BRL has done next to nothing to make any of those other parts easier. Adding a 3D module... meh... okay so now I can 'program 3D'? .... really... write programs in order to get 3D stuff to happen on the screen? You know how much time that is going to take and the total lack of any kind of friendly tool that saves time and automates painful tasks, without having to write one yourself? That's where the competition is leaving BRL behind. It's not about languages.. it's about ease of development, and that has to mean an easier 'interface' to the computer, which means visual software editors, not having to write text programs to do everything. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
