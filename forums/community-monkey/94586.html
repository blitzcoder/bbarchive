The operating system by itself is something like £25, and includes Xcode.<br><br>There's also a fee of 100 something ($? £? I forget) to register as an iPhone developer and use the App Store.

In order to compile for you, your friend would need all of your credentials and would have complete control over your account. Anything they did - whether intentional or not - would be tied to you, and since the Apple terms of service expressly forbid letting anyone else have that kind of access, you would be legally liable for anything that person did.<br><br>Deploying to Android/iOS is not really cheap any way you look at it. You need a few different devices to test on because one won't cut it. Android, in particular, has so many gotchas and devices which report functionality that they don't actually have that you just can't easily predict what will work and what won't. On iOS you have different aspect ratios, and you have the retina displays where the resolution is much higher but the screen size is the same. Then you have certain functionality which tied to a particular OS version and you have to find a way to stop people with other versions buying it and rating your app down. It's not something you can really afford to skimp on - even more so if you're contemplating spreading yourself even thinner supporting multiple mobile platforms. If you can afford to do one platform properly, I'd suggest picking one and just doing that one. I'd personally lean toward iOS because it's a lot more predictable than Android. I have no experience with Windows Phone, but there seems to be no money in Windows Phone development.<br><br>EDIT: Although Android is probably cheaper since you could probably get by with three test devices, which would almost certainly be cheaper than a Mac Mini and a couple of iOS devices.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
