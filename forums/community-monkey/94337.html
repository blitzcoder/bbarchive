Supporting properly more than one platform, and also BLIde Plus, and also other non-blitz related project I work in would have been too much. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It has to be done in the native "part" of things, so in this area, Jungle can't provide any specific debuging features. I hope this will change in the future, but I don't know yet. To do so, a Monkey interpreter or something like this should be required. Maybe a native generation of pdb files for XNA would do the trick, but this has to be done first in the compiler side of things. If Monkey ever supports debugging, Jungle Ide will be able to debug directly Monkey code. But not before :D <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Of course! I've been beta testing Jungle inside vmware too, to test it on Windows XP, Vista and Seven. And during the process I've optimized it a lot to be fast also on single core machines, and on virtualized environments. Some of the Jungle Ide testers have been using it on parallels on the Mac, and it's very fast there too. I wish I had the time to make it also Mac compatible, but I don't see this coming any time soon. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

BLIde is the result of more than 6 years of development. During this process I've learned a lot and there are several things you end thinking "wish I did this another way" etc. While I'm very proud of BLIde and I think it works pretty well, I think a brand new IDE framework to build Jungle was mandatory. BLIde is not designed to support overloading or data type inference, and was designed without multithreading in mind. Also, BLIde is not really ready to work without BlitzMax. So all in all, it would be a major rewrite of BLIde.<br><br>Jungle Ide is lightweight, a lot faster in several areas, and smaller. It's designed to be very scalable and has been designed with multithreading into account from the begining. As an example, we do not need any spash window in the IDE while the internal language databases are being loaded. It's fast enough to make this almost instant. This could not have been possible with just a plugin for BLIde. Also, Jungle Ide internally has a sort of "actors" desing where several areas of the IDE work independently (literaly can be spread on cores) so Jungle Ide is capable of editing larger solutions. BLIde can handle properly solutions with hundreds of files, while Jungle is ready to support thousands very easily.<br><br>Also, the internal management of GDI resources has been drastically improved in the new framework. <br><br>There's a small video I did some weeks ago. It is just a small vid, but you get the idea of how fast it launches, how fast it loads a solution, and how many resources are you using (in the example is using less than 10 MiB to operate).<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-X2pL2yPt0&amp;hd=1" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-X2pL2yPt0&amp;hd=1</a><br><br>This video does not represent current version, as the IDE has been improved in several areas. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I don't currently have much interest in Monkey, but if I did, I would definitely be buying your IDE. Blide was one of the best things to happen to BlitzMax, and while I can't remember how much I paid for it, I know it wasn't enough. I don't know if Visual Studio was an inspiration - although I assume it was - but it was definitely very close to being Visual Studio for BlitzMax. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

A Solution is a collection of (at last) one project. So multiple file's project should be accomplished by using a Solution. This way Jungle Ide can provide intelliprompt understanding all the relative/absolute file paths to everything in the project, and can provide much more accurate intellipromt.<br><br><div class="quote"> I have a habit of pressing &lt;enter&gt; for intelliprompt listbox entries. On another IDE I use this accepts the current entry and continues on the same code line, just like TAB key in fact. <br></div><br>Well, on Jungle Ide, intellisense completion is a bit more clever. Let me explain:<br><br>Intellisense on Jungle Ide works the same as BLIde. All operators perform completion, so you just have to press whatever it comes after the word you're completing. Enter included.<br><br>That is, instead of using Enter to close the intellisense popup always, it is much better to just use whatever you're going to write. I mean, if after the word there's a "(" just, write it. If it is a space or an operator or a dot, just press it and, if it is a new line, just press enter.<br><br>This is a way to improve writing speed and this make things a lot easier than having to scroll and select and press Enter as in other IDEs, but you have to get used to it first (it does not take too much).<br><br>If you're so used to use the Enter key to perform completion, that you can't use anything else, in that case, you can modify the default settings in the preferences dialog. I wouldn't recommend it unless you've given it a proper try, it's worth it, but you have to get used to it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
