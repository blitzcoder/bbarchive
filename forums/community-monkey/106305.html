The first is a map tree which is used for the bulk of the map and supports collision and hundreds of thousands of map elements. The second class is map image. Map images are generally used for background/foreground elements in a map and like map tree can be layered. Both systems create a map space that you put elements (parts for map tree and images for map image) into and each map space (or layer) can be drawn independently. This give a nice degree of flexibility when constructing a map. <br><br>The map tree collision can be used independently as well and for example if you want several layers (or map spaces) of collision you need only add map parts defined with collision vertices to a map space. You can then draw the map space, or not, ( DrawMap() ) and then additionally check the map space for collision ( MapCollision() ). Using the physics (simple inertia for now) and collision (also fairly simple but simple is good and fast) frameworks you can pass along a physics objects position using MapCollision() which returns true if a collision has occurred. You can then poll GetCollisionNormal() to retrieve the normal and also GetCollisionCoord() to get the collision coordinates. I'll probably be adding a GetMapElement() to return the map element or part involved in the collision plus other methods to assist in interactions.<br><br>So thats sort of a simple overview of how the map and collision systems work as of now. I'm still fleshing out how I want to approach this but, so far, it is working out well. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In 2 days I ported 6000 lines of code and I already have a GUI window up and running and displaying images. I still have some work to do and some kinks to work out but I am really impressed at how well the MX1 code has ported over to Monkey2. I am also enjoying discovering all the new features that Monkey2 offers. Even in it's early stage of development. The mojo properties style architecture is clean and feels modern. In fact I'll be tweaking my code to better reflect the Monkey2 architecture overall. Just super impressed with what Mark has done with Monkey2 and mojo. <br><br>I will be porting over the mapping system and other parts of the framework next and as soon as I can I'll post a video of Alien Phoenix running on it's new home Monkey2!<br><br>You can get a copy of Monkey2 on <a href="https://github.com/blitz-research/monkey2" target="_blank">github</a> and if you already have Monkey-X you can install it and run it alongside with TED. It is certainly stable enough for you to get discovering and learning what Monkey2 is all about. Also don't forget about supporting Mark's awesome efforts on his <b><a href="https://www.patreon.com/monkey2?ty=h" target="_blank">Patreon</a></b> page.

I can't begin to describe the difference from my old 19". Love it! Aside from a giant screen I can now see way better color definition which is what I need for game art/assets development. Such a treat to work with code on this.<br><br>I also just bought a Zotac GTX 950 AMP! video card . It should be here Friday. :D With the new monitor I can now push forward in development as my current video card and monitor were not letting me get the job done. The Zotac GTX 950 AMP! benchmarks at about 90% of the performance of a GTX 960, is less expensive and has better compatibility with Linux (I use Linux as a development platform) then the GTX 960. It also uses less power with a 90 watt rating (uses a 6 pin connector). So overall a very good bang for the buck.<br><br>I finally saved enough to get what I needed. It's awesome to step out of a 720p world and into a 1080p one and this new graphic card should let me capture video without any issues. <br><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013P30MVK/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" target="_blank">Zotac GTX 950 AMP!</a> on amazon. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The map now supports rotation for all of the background asteroids, so they all rotate (except collision layer ones) in this map. Additionally I have made some tweaks to the parallax layers for better viewing.  I've also added a new planet (larger size) and a new star field background. The new hardware has proven to be nice and useful. <br><br>I've been working on converting the Alien Phoenix framework to Monkey 2 (video shows app made with Monkey-X) which is going well and affording the opportunity to improve things. I've been a little sidetracked by new hardware but that's a nice diversion to have. Anyway, back on track. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
