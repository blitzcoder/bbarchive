This surely is a warranty that a 'common standard' will be implemented.<br><br>Technically speaking I haven't see any major error in HTML5 games in the different platforms (I played with Monkey and there are many other html5-games-sites around): excluding speed differences (due to javascript interpreter or graphics driver support) everything works.<br>And checking Monkey-generated code I didn't see any check for player like in the past for IE or Netscape...<br><br>Of course HTML5 is more than 'canvas'... but at the moment I'm interested in this feature.<br><br>Apple has its own politic: its point of view is correct and logic. Their products, their rules. None is obliged to buy Apple products. If you do, you should accept this, otherwise look around for another solution (Android, Wp7...).<br><br>And about codecs: the 'war' behind the video codecs is - of course - to ensure the Major. Major owns movie rights, they want DRM/control/everything. If you can offer a solution they like, you win and can offer to your customers the 'content'. Otherwise, niet.<br>GoogleMusic is still in stand-by because of this (I presume, and of course because a lot of money...)<br><br>Flash: under Linux sometimes I have problems, so the slogan 'all the platform' is quite optimistic. I have an AcerAspireOne with Linux and when I access a page with flash the netbook 'greyout' for some seconds and everything slow down. When runs Windows everything works without problems, so the problem is not the hardware. They have a very low interest in Linux: fine. So if in the future they decide to drop it? Better have an alternative.<br><br>* Thanks Microsoft - at work - we still need to use IE (and for some old application IE6!) because someone decided that 'internet' was 'the microsoft vision'.<br>And to make things more funny, we pay (from 2010) € 1400,00+VAT at month for a web-application. The only problem they decided to write it ONLY for internet explorer and Adobe Acrobat...<br>So we have many collaborators that have bought tablets (ipad) or smartphone (android) or netbook (with linux preinstalled): they can't use the application... I still remember the day (because I ignored the limit of 'IE'...) when I said them 'you could work from your newest smartphone like from you pc!'...<br><br>I tried everything: Opera, Chome, Firefox, Safari on every platform: sometime I can make the login, I can make some procedures, or the application stop responds.<br><br>The problems are in the past, not in the future.<br><br>In any case better have different solutions! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
