In this regard, BlitzMax is a sinking ship. Notice I didn't say that <b>computer gaming</b> is sinking...on the contrary, I think computers will always be a viable game platform.

Monkey is nice, but I wouldn't consider it for writing games for PC or Mac yet.  For me monkey is for mobile dev only where games are simplier and you don't mind working with a much lower command set.  <br><br>Blitzmax however is far more mature and has several decent 3rd party graphics engine to satisfy most people.  The command set is much more developed and needs less code than monkey to produce some quick games.  As some mentioned early in monkey you have to code things like collisions routines etc.  So there is a lot more ground work to done setting up a decent set of libraries with monkey.  This of course will change over time, but may be stiffled a bit by trying to make the code work on so many platforms.  Take for example today we can't have coloured sprite e.g. setcolor 0,255,0 does not draw sprite green because not all target support these feature.  This is standard in Bmax.  So for desktop gaming Bmax still has a bright future I think.  And for mobile gaming monkey is on the right track.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font><br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There are lots of native specific things that work out of the box on BlitzMax but do not have a counterpath in Monkey, such as Streams, reflection or function pointers. But monkey itself is built on a highly expandable basis and it is very very open and easy to addapt to your own needs. So, taking into account how young it is, I supose it could technically replace BlitzMax, but it's a long way to do it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Microsoft already went 64-Bit-only for their server products since Windows Server 2008 R2 and Exchange 2010, so Windows 9 could be a realistic target for that move on the client. If you still want to run old legacy 32-Bit apps, you might have to launch a virtual machine for that, similar to the "XP Mode" for Win 7. That move would even make sense from a security and stability perspective.<br><br>But Apple will get there faster than Microsoft. With OS X Lion, Apple will drop the support for 32-Bit processors (Lion requires at least a Core 2 Duo CPU) and they will also drop the support for their PowerPC emulator Rosetta. Lion will still run 32-Bit apps, of course, but Apple generally is more radical with dropping legacy support than Microsoft ever could be. Should there be another incarnation of OS X after Lion (which I somehow doubt, I think it's more likely that iOS and OS X will merge into a "new" OS after that), it will probably drop 32-Bit support entirely, forcing everybody to upgrade to 64-Bit applications.<br><br>I don't think that 32-Bit software for desktop computers has much of a future left. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
