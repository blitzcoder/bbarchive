Why reinvent things when you can use proven and widely supported resources. Mark has a lot to do getting the core of Monkey2 going so it is IMHO upto us (leaders in the community) to bring in things like 3D engines. Monkey2 is open source and I think it is time to start treating it that way by picking out the parts of the language where you can improve it by adapting or creating resources that solve some of the issues listed here. There is plenty of time to get going and lots of support to get it done.<br><br>I am thinking of doing this and open sourcing my gaming framework for Monkey-X/Monkey2. It now seems to me to make more sense to support Monkey2 by providing quality and flashy / attention getting resources that add to Monkey2 and help lift it into a wider audience. I know I am serious in my Monkey efforts and so are many others and together (along with Mark) we will deliver a development platform that will be successful. <br><br>It is important to note that those who are helping to drive Monkey2 forward are in large part seasoned coders with many years of experience. Experience that in the end will change and improve the BRL path we have been on. Change that is welcome and lasting. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

End</pre><br>But you may want to 'Using' the namespace. It imports everything from a namespace into the global namespace,<br>with the result that you can use it directly - without always using full name qualifiers:<br><pre class=code>#Import "&lt;libc&gt;"               ' Import a library/framework

Using libc                     ' We are using namespace 'libc' -
                               ' That means, everything from namespace 'libc'
                               ' becomes directly available within the global namespace

Struct Point
    Field x:Int
    Field y:Int
End

Function Main()
    Local pt:Point
    Print("sizeof(pt):")
    Print( sizeof(pt)  )        ' use Function sizeof - we don't need to write libc.sizeof() anymore,

For now I am just releasing the same builds except it has Pyro included for people who want to use it. When I say plan to do more I will first contact Mark if I can help out there first before I will decide to 'do my own'. That is also the nature of open source isn't it?<br><br><div class="quote"> I like Max as I can use oop(bmx version) and make a large project or I could just type <br></div><br><br>After the small initial setup ( Main plus Window class ) the same thing goes practically for Monkey 2.<br><br><div class="quote"> Mojo2 is now available in Blitzmax NG <br></div><br>Mojo2 is not the same as Mojo from Monkey 2. The Monkey 2 version is called plain Mojo and is a different beast. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

With all the mojos it's kind of confusing :) For a beast, I hope it comes with 3D.<br><br>Anyway, if I were to pick on these 2 free and open source frameworks, I'm still gonna go with NG, for now, because it is easier to use and Blitzmax syntax. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
