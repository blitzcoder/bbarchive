I have no idea what Monkey lets me do.  Yes, I know it's essentially a cross-compiler to other languages/platforms, and that's loud and clear.  What else does it do?<br><br>So, let's take a quick look at a few of the pages I would check for information, starting with the front page:<br><img src="http://www.spifftastic.net/skitch/Monkeyfp-20110701-134201.png"><br>The special compiler feature is made apparent in six different places, but I'm not really clear on what else I can do with Monkey.  Maybe it's explained elsewhere..<br><br>Let's try the 'about' page, surely I'll figure out what Monkey actually does there.  Behold:<br><img src="http://www.spifftastic.net/skitch/Monkeyabt-20110701-134430.gif"><br>Nope.  Same deal here, I know what I can compile to, but still not clear what Monkey lets me do aside from target different platforms, which is cool, but what can I make that targets those platforms?<br><br>Alright, third time's the charm.  Let's try the store page.  Surely if I was interested in buying this, they'd let me know what I can do with it by then, right?<br><img src="http://www.spifftastic.net/skitch/Monkeystr-20110701-134643.gif"><br>Wrong.  Same spiel as before, target a number of different platforms to make stuff.  What stuff can I make?  Apps, but what kind of apps?  It's obviously for games, so what kind of games can I make?  Not really clear on that or the capabilities of Monkey's core libraries are (presumably that's what 'Mojo' is, which isn't telling me a whole lot).<br><br>Now, I want to make something clear, I've been around Blitz long enough to know that about the only thing these languages are useful for is games and middleware for games.  The problem here is what happens when some random new person comes along and sees these pages looking for info?  Well, she probably sees a lot about how it targets different platforms and.. isn't really sure what else it does.  Is Monkey just a generic compiler and I have to roll my own everything?  Probably not, but I'll be damned if I'd know that looking at the site.<br><br>However, I have to admit that even though I know Monkey is probably for games, I haven't got a single bloody clue about what I can do with it.  I don't really have time to download the demo and fiddle around with it and try to read what I'm assuming is the traditionally lacking documentation, so what am I supposed to do here?  What does the random person do?<br><br>So, the whole point of this topic was pretty simple: I think the Monkey pages need to be cleaned up and it needs to be clear what Monkey does, can do, and promises to make easier for me/you/her/him.  <i>All</i> of the things it does, not just the compiling-for-multiple-platforms thing, though obviously leave that front and center because it's <i>really important.</i>  Improve the about page, throw up some code examples, explain all the awesome features of Mojo, link to some example documentation in there, do <i>something</i> that helps explain what Monkey does for me other than compile stuff.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You deal with drawing primitives, the details of which are defined by the user's art assets, and you either take control of the whole screen, or you open a simple graphics window and ignore what's going on outside. The same game will usually look the same on multiple platforms if it had access to the same high-level graphics API.<br><br>"Apps", however, require an actual interface. And unfortunately every single operating system has a <i>wildly</i> different idea of how this should work and even the basic philosophy behind it. The base themes are different, the standard button layouts and sizes are different, the standard ways dialogs appear and are controlled are different, even what gadgets you can actually use are different. Go and grab any GTK application for Windows to see this effect in action.<br><br>Your options are: use a common simplified subset, and have your app look equally awful and handle equally badly everywhere; use your own interface, and multiply the amount of work you have to do by ten as well as getting automatically disqualified from <i>all</i> the App Stores for ignoring style guidelines, and ignored by users for being unintuitive; or write a different interface each time and lose the cross-platform advantages.<br><br>There's no reason you couldn't use it to create applications of any kind, but the advantages that make it (and e.g. BlitzMax) good for games simply don't apply in that field.<br><br><br><b>EDIT:</b> I am exaggerating, by the way - obviously Java has made a solid reputation for cross-platform app development. It also has a solid reputation for producing really ugly GUI applications though: it can be done, but doing it <i>well</i> is a great challenge.

I have no idea if it can use the "stuff" from the various platforms or if at the end of the day it is just a canvas with some cool graphics commands for drawing on, purely for  games and nothing else...  Also the lack of proper debug, call stack and stepping makes a lot of these type of things more time consuming than just bashing out a native verision imo (at least when a multi-skilled team is involved). ...and I have seen seasoned programmers reduced to ranting wrecks when they cannot debug.<br><br>Where we are at, it is actually easier to have 4 guys 2 android and 2 ios guys ...(and all experienced in c++/c# so if winmob ever erupts like a pussy boil we have it covered too)... to "make something" than work with "translators" and "halfway houses" - and we have tried -many- of them from titanium to mono.  While the app's core code is easily converted, mapping for the different APIs is the tricky bit.. but is where we all come in, in different ways using wrappings and interfaces. <br><br>Not meaning to rain on any parades, i am sure for normal 2d games monkey is great, but my "scope" goes further than just graphics. For example i may want to write a game that reads GPS coords to generate levels or uses a mapview oe webview in some way. Or simply my bread and butter, which is writing functional apps for companies, academies and other institutions to do what they want it to do.<br><br>These kind of questions are not clear at all and could ultimately confuse. I am trying to give an outside voice, of course the primary scope of monkey is for games, but it is misleading.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You can create classes that act like "drivers" for native classes, that's one of the strongest points of Monkey but this is not advertised as it's not exactly what average indie game coders may be interested in... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
