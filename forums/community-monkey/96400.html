I've added a solution for that to MonkeyGame.java (regarding the out of memory problem) and reported it in the bug forum over there at MonkeyCoder. But all in all it's a good idea to load only currently needed resources and use image.Discard() a lot for images you don't need currently.<br><br>Window phones eat almost everything. :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Oh and then you have to render them offscreen before using them if you like to draw them without delay, another great feature.

Remember the limit is per process not per app so is not nessecarily a total showstopper. They do this to ensure no app eats up so much that it steals too much resulting in a better "phone" user experience.<br>(And if you dont like java, then you do not -have- to use it)<br><br>Yeah development is nice on windows phones. C# is a really nice language to code in. Problem is the user experience is so awful, so i am not sure how well windows is going take off. <br>I have a friend who works for a mobile phone shop and he claims they have sold hardly any (and not just talking about his store).<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
