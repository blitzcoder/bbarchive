An update to BlitzMax (call it 2?) with the new OOP features, some new targets (Android, Ios, HTML5 and Flash) will fill the gap (with the all knows limits - ie: some mod cant' be rewritten to same targets and so on).<br>But of course this is/was a BRL decision, no matter what I/we think about it.<br><br><br>@Skid<br>One point in favour of Monkey: it's still young and 'extensions' can't be compared to all the mods available for Bmax today. In future maybe we have a different situation.<br><br>@Another cons<br><br>MonkeyX IS game oriented. <br>You have no official UI access (like MaxGUI). So the potential of the language is still limited...and thinking the worst if Mark decide to stop developing of Monkey I think this will never be filled (hoping in the community is not ever a good choice) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Many Targets.<br>2. 'Write Once, Run Everywhere' from my experience works 95%. Small tweaks are sometimes needed for specific targets.<br>3. Language is a step up from BlitzMax. Better OOP. More organized.<br>4. Ability to add any native code I may need directly to my project and have it instantly work inside Monkey is huge plus.<br>5. User created targets.<br>6. Modular. Many very easy to use modules. Box2D, Autofit, FontMachine, etc.<br>7. Included 2D graphics 'Mojo' framework works great and is fast.<br>8. Very small filesizes compared to other game creation software.<br>9. Classes, Inheritance, Reflection, Generics.<br><br>Bad Points:<br>1. Setting up all targets can be a pain, but you only need to do it once.<br>2. "Lowest common denominator target features" as therevills mentioned.<br>3. The included default IDE is not the greatest.<br>4. Documentation could use work.<br><br>I exclusively use Monkey for games now. Monkey is really great for a hobbyist like me. I have a job outside of programming or anything computer related so I definitely don't make a living off this. However I have released many small games to the android app store and make a decent amount of extra cash. I don't advertise, rarely release updates, don't need to ever contact anyone or negotiate deals or anything. I simply release and make continuously make small amounts of money for doing absolutely nothing. While I loved BlitzMax, I never made money from it. With Monkey I have recouped everything I've spent on all Blitz products and bought a new PC. And I put in much less work than I ever did in BlitzMax. <br><br>EdzUp, I am not sure when the last time you tried Monkey was, but there has been support to change Desktop resolutions and toggle fullscreen and windowed modes for quite some time on the Desktop and XNA targets. Simply use the SetDeviceWindow( width, height, flags) function. There is also a DisplayModes() function to get a array of valid resolutions. I used these commands in my latest game and it works great! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I know we have no 'rights' about this (Mark did the first 'error' publishing that post...), but for possible new customers (or like Gfk, for who is choosing a product for future development) is not a good behavior.<br><br>@EdzUp:<br>your point (SDK download and configuration) is something already said. I have no doubt Mark could create something in less than a day to resolve that (that is the FIRST - and maybe more frustrating problem for new Monkey's customers).

Yes the IDE is getting work maybe maxgui but tbh I can't see it being majorly updated unless brucey does it but then it becomes 'third party support' which will put some people off once again. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
