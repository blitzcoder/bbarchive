Mark's got an office now and is in %100. Hitting the $1000 goal allows him to work fulltime on Monkey 2 and 3D. He lays it out in his blog really well I think. Monkey 2 has had a great start and with the right kind of financial support quite a lot can get done developing it.<br><br><b>About Monkey 2</b><br>Monkey 2 is a seed change in almost every way compared to previous BRL languages. Frankly, in my humble opinion, Monkey 2 is 'not' oriented toward previous BRL coders per-se, but instead aimed at everyone else. What I mean by that is Monkey 2 embraces modern programming techniques and support for third party libraries. This provides support and familiarity to those who code in Java or C/C++ or whatever. Embracing this larger audience is a foundational component of Monkey 2. Monkey does this with an eye on the past, allowing many of the same / similar commands and class structures that you use now. I have converted thousands of lines of code from Blitz Max to Monkey X to Monkey 2, possible because of a basic level of support for legacy syntax and structure. <br><br>I hope that the doubters look at the totality of Mark's path. Monkey 2 really shows off his experience and what he has learned from the past. His efforts on Monkey 2 have been for the most part spot on and well thought out. Monkey 2 offers you a path forward, where you have a voice in it's development. It has an open source code base that allows you to contribute and is free to use. There is a lot of potential for Monkey 2 and it exist in an environment that allows for growth, developer input and wider acceptance. I recommend giving Monkey 2 a try. I can't think of a better language project to back. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

He comes across something "working not as expected" - and has to either circumvent it - or to fix the issue it bases on.<br><br><br>Next to 3D modules and the like it would be better to work on a good IDE - eg. by building a plugin for IntelliJ or so (so you do not have to build the editor but rather the language-support). And no, TED and that "TED GO" are no "IDEs" - last time (1 month ago) that TED GO put me off from even trying more with its unnatural GUI behaviour (modal dialogues). With such editors you can surely do things, but it just is not a "wow factor" for new users. And yes, there needs to be a freely available editor which does support all features the language provides (debugging, target options ...). Convenience things (assistants, intellisense, ...) could be provided by 3rd party (like jungle, blide, ...). If doing the IntelliJ-plugin-thing you get intellisense and the likes "for free".<br><br>For now you have the engine of a car but instead of a steering wheel you god some cables which you need to connect manually to steer left or right. It needs a wheel (or similar thing) to make the car "useable". Making a 3D-module is like adding air condition or a new hifi-system.<br><br>Yes, it is good to have "good audio" (or 3D-graphics) and it surely is a "USP" but the basic features have to be existing to make it a "serious" choice for new users.<br><br><br>Re: IntelliJ<br>For the language inventor it should not be that hard to write the lexer part (and what is needed in addition) so it works with such an editor as intented.<br>Instead of trying to get the m2-editor be able to work on all supported platforms, it should concentrate to work on the platforms a developer uses to type his code.

What I mean by that is Monkey 2 embraces modern programming techniques and support for third party libraries." ....<br><br>Really? You think that 'everyone else' wants to actually write source code programs in order to develop games? Times have moved on big time. <br><br>The glaring gaping hole in the Blitz toolset now is the fact is does not have a visual, easy-to-use, time-saving editor. It's got nothing to do with what the language does or how its written or whether it supports libraries or whatever. Being the right programming language is not the way to go. Game development isn't about writing lots of code anymore.<br><br>Go look at almost all of the competition, Game Maker, Game Salad, Construct, MultiMedia Fusion, and also Unity3D, Unreal engine etc. Look at what is involved in making a modern game of decent quality. It's not all about programming. You've got art assets to manage. You've got levels to design. You've got tons of objects to play in the environment. You've got physics to assemble. You've got 3D stuff going on all over the place. You've got modern screen effects and shaders happening effortlessly. And then when you can't do something that the editor provides, you've got third party add-ons that provide extra workflows. And then if you exhaust those, THEN you can dip into some 'scripting', which is typically slow, painful, complicated and advanced.<br><br>But the fact is, programming now, compared to using a visual editor, is a huge pain. It takes an extraordinary amount of time and effort. A visual editor isn't just there to give you a different way to make games it's there to AUTOMATE tons of tasks and to give you a much easier time saving way of iterating creatively, experimenting, polishing etc. Do you really want to try to do that in source code? You want to go back to source code in order to implement a complicated 3D animation? You want to go to sourcecode to build your basic AI or collision detection? You want to spend weeks or months having to build either an engine or a 'tool' to try to save time? <br><br>Blitz should really focus on getting a solid backend - Monkey should be the backend, MAYBE with 3D (and maybe 3rd party 3D), and then cover this all over with a thick slab of WYSIWYG editing. So that you barely have to ever 'program' anymore. See then just how productive you become, how much time you save, how much less painful it is to put stuff together. Because really, this whole paradigm of 'programming games' is significantly limiting and holding back ALL developers who are trying to make games this way. It's archaic. This is how things were 'hot' 10 years ago. The answer is not another 'better Monkey' or whatever..... totally totally missing the point.... totally out of touch with the general game-development audience. Not going to win many fans any time soon when people can go get a visual editor that makes it EASY and saves a ton of time.<br><br>I think if BRL is so obsessed with 'making languages' then BRL should focus on making the backend systems - Monkey - the script language - and hire or partner with someone else to make a glossy user-friendly front-end. The language should not be the front end, or where all development happens. It should be a backend feature for 'advanced users' to do more complicated stuff if they really need to - i.e. if the editor isn't flexible enough to do what they want. But almost all development tasks can be automated and turned into tools and workflows that save time and effort and headaches. It's a no-brainer. Programming games in a language is going to gradually die and be replaced with tools. It's already happened.<br><br>Quite literally the 'game' has changed. Development is not about writing programs all day anymore, for the vast majority of would-be game developers. Its about the higher level tools. That's where BRL has to go, and if they don't, which they haven't, they will just continue to gasp for air in a crowded market. I love BlitzMax and Monkey seems clever but ... really... its 2017 no 2000... we need time-saving visual editors now, not more elegant ways to spend weeks on end trying to do even the 'basic' stuff that all the other engines can do in 5 minutes. Leaving 'tools' up to the user is a major fail in my opinion. Now you have to spend tons of time writing a half-baked pretty ugly tool that barely does the job, AND THEN maybe you can start saving some time. Maybe you'll make up for all the time it took to make the tool in the first place.<br><br>Higher level editing. That's what the people want. And someday we're going to be just talking to the computer and have it auto-generate the game of our dreams in a matter of minutes. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There is active development. If you don't need one of the many things Brucey made possible for Max/MaxNG, you could check out monkey2. A active community could help bringing things together too.<br><br>c) Audio and 3d are very important. More important than implementing nerd editor heaven, no one will ever see in a final product. I would rather drive a sports car with two wires only than having a great steering wheel but without a reasonable motor experience. 3d dev is highly driven by what you can get out of an engine. If you can have both (a balanced experience), that's even better.<br><br>d) Ditching Unity, without knowing it, is stupid and so &lt;= 2015. In most cases Unity's IDE is a big time saver. Unity combines accessibility via its editor with the flexibility coding offers in order to make things easier and faster. If Mark had the resources, he would go for such an approach too. Unity suffers from its bugs, size and ancient mono-core/garbage collector but is highly optimised in many aspects where BRL products don't even offer a bad solution.<br><br>e) @Simon Armstrong: You could relax more often or not moderate a forum as you sometimes don't show the right temper/character.<br><br>f) A 3d engine is a critical part of a game engine, therefore many devs try to come up with their own solution, mixing it with middleware for certain aspects, in order to have control. It would be great if Mark could come up with something within a year or so.<br><br>g) There doesn't exist a big market for a Blitz3D like engine with bump maps and shader support (most of you probably will never touch twice). Either you stick with the BRL audience or you need to offer something more competetive (like a modern focused 3d engine, Unity light). 3d is not 2d. 3d is more about performance, up to date concepts/hardware and visual quality.<br><br>h) Ted2Go is just plain awful. It looks wrong, it feels wrong. If you're complainging about Unity's IDE, try to use this one.

Regardless of a lack of financial feedback, you should try to be aware of staying on track without ignoring users' needs.<br><br>j) BRL products always had an emphasis on games and you could utalise this power for other field of applications. Supporting tons of platforms as a focus on apps would overload the one man show and there is no chance that Mark would be able keeping up with all platforms. If you want cumbersome support of many platforms, see how Monkey-X failed. If you're serious about apps, you want to utalize each system's pros and go native. Weird looking outdated gui apps aren't competitive and internet apps aren't in BRL's (or its users) focus either. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

A.o. I wanted to test the behaviour of concave (not available, so faking with springs) and convex poly collisions.<br><br>In monkey2: open monkey2, write/open a generic setup, add code for loading and offering images, look up the docs for chipmunk options -&gt; no examples -&gt; browsing through the official chipmunk doc-&gt; write code to add the physics definitions for the sprites (for poly collisions you need to define a convex hull with the related vertex data, so either a) download a tool which gets such info from the images or write one on your own and copy&amp;paste the data into your code or b) measure the pixels in a paint program and gen the vertex list with the coordinates), write code to update the simulation, write code to link the physics to the sprites and display them, write code to free memory, write movement code, compile and run a few times in order to tweak parameters and get the desired result, finish.<br><br>In Unity: open the editor, select a 2d project, drag the images into the asset area, from there drag them into the hierarchy, position the sprites properly in the scene, add 2d physic components to the sprites (collision hull is automatically generated), edit the properties, gen a script, write some c# movement code, drag it into the hierarchy, less tweaking of the parameters for getting the desired result needed (due to the wysiwyg game view in the editor), finish.<br><br>You could do this by code as well (more work).<br><br>The IDE is good for managing data, editing properties, game specific customisations, setting up/tweaking the visuals/sound ... This procedure is faster for a typical setup. Obviously procedural generation benefits less from such a workflow, except for exposing realtime parameters to the editor. The beauty is about striking the right balance. Sometimes you're more into an editor, sometimes you wanna go by code. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Talking about ingame-gui, resource-management-via-configuration-files (xml or so), sprites, sprite-atlases, versatile text formatting (block text, hyphenation, mixing bold/italic/embossed/gradient...whatever you like and [b]bold[/] and [/italic] in one sentence) ... <br>Nowerdays developers want many things - and you will have to provide them all this right from start. This is not possible that fast - which is why I suggested an extension/addon-system for the editor. And once you think about such things, you might end up using eclipse/atom/intelij for already providing such systems (at least I think so).<br><br>If the language exposes properties correctly - so the editor is able to tell what options to provide to a user, then these things could be presented to the coder in a dialogue box - but I do not know if M2 is capable of doing this (yet).<br><br><br>Nonetheless: Of course an editor providing features for all the "basically provided things" would be a nice thing. You want to play a sound? "Menu -&gt; Add -&gt; Simple -&gt; PlayMusic", Dialogue opens and provides a dropdown of already loaded music-URIs and also a file browser. Now the coder selects an existing file and only the "PlayMusic(existingVariable)" is suggested (might still fail if the user intentionally renamed/refilled the variable content). If the user selected a new file (via file browser) then it is also the file-loading-code appended to the sourcecode.<br><br>But these things only work if you have centralized "onStart" or "InitResources()" hooks. Things in which the music file could get added to get loaded. Without that - read it is totally up to the coder when and where he loads resources - such helpers are not able to take off that much work load from the coder.<br><br>So you will have to place some "rails" for the projects to traverse on - and as long as they follow that "rails" the tools will be able to help.<br><br>For everything else you have to fall back to real basic helpers (font-choosers with font previews, image previews, sound previews, color choosers).<br><br><br>I would be interested to see how many (commercial) games were made with BlitzMax and the default framework - not utilizing custom framework code (TEntity, TParticle, TSprite, ...). There might be some, but the more complex the gameplay gets, the harder I think a "click-your-game"-solution would be for a "visual editor". Same for staying within the "predefined-framework-code".<br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I don't want it to be complex and bloated. There is something about staying slim whilst offering the right aspects. People are happy when their worlds are clearly arranged. Unity tries to offer everything, that's not where Mark should try to go. More Sublime, less Eclipse. Mark already started offering some data preview (images and sounds) in ted2. More integration and additional options wouldn't hurt.<br><br>Many of the IDE-nay-sayers fail to see, that it's not about to replace coding in the first place. It's about a reasonable shift where to use code and where something more appropriate, like using an editor, makes sense. Normally you don't want to paint your textures by code, you use an image editor because you want to experience what you paint, you want to use a wacom, you want instant feedback, you want it to be flexible. Same goes for a composing music, you use an instrument, a tracker or whatever but you don't limit yourself by editing bytes in an array. This might be nice for a demo compo but not how it works best for most use cases.<br><br>And the same is valid for certain further tasks in game development (or 3d/2d media). It makes no sense editing your lighting when you can't see it. It's mostly cumbersome defining a 3d world (i know that ray marching with distance fields is cool) by code and you can't imagine how materials look like without realtime feedback. Somehow this goes back to the C64 when it took a night to render out a fractal. The more direct and intuitive you can edit a project and receive feedback, the better.<br><br>The editor in Unity and the access to the engines offer one way of shifting some of the (meta) data away from code in order to making it easier (also causing less errors) and faster setting up things. Live representation of code is cool too and also helps making you less blind. Fast compilation times help as well. There are multiple ways to enhance the situation.<br><br>Ultimately you want results and you head for the workflow which offers the best experience. If a mouse driven OS is better than DOS then there is no reason to stay with DOS. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
