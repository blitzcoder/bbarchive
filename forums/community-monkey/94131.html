(If the communities for the older languages are anything to go by, Max itself is not going to disappear any time soon.)<br><br>I don't know to what extent it's been discussed already, but what are the odds of things like a homegrown 3D engine appearing? Rather small I would have thought, because it sounds like it would be far more complex to force to fit with the many platforms. So for a large subset of more demanding games and applications - which BlitzMax has shown it handles very well - there won't be any real advantage in moving to Monkey (e.g. Leadwerks will still be Windows-only or whatever it is). I would naturally expect the Monkey community to tend towards only developing more cross-platform libraries, too.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Somehow, I doubt that.<br><br>BRL now has FOUR languages on sale, and I wonder how such a small company is going to support them. My guess is that three of those products are now in COBOL - read: maintenance - mode and only Monkey is getting serious attention for the time being. And that is until BRL decides to create a new product, and then the cycle starts all over again.<br><br>I think there are two problems at work here. <br><br>One is BRL's business model of "buy once, get all upgrades for free forever". Once the saturation point is reached, you need to come up with a new product to keep the cash flowing, and with limited resources, this can only mean that from then on the already existing products only get the lowest possible minimum of attention from the company that created them.<br><br>I guess the second problem is interest - or lack of interest, to be more precise. Maintaining the same product over years becomes BORING, and you just need a new challenge after a while. Thus goodbye BlitzMax, Blitz3D and BlitzBasic and enter Monkey. And I guess in three to five years, we will see the next new language coming from BRL and Monkey will then enter the COBOL phase.<br><br>I cannot say that I blame BRL for that, I can absolutely understand it from their perspective. But from my personal perspective, I currently have some difficulties evaluating this new product and its possible place in my own little world. I am also not so sure about my willingness to buy into yet another new and most likely rather short-lived endeavor. I wonder if going for one of the competing, subscription-based products might not get me something more reliable on the long run. <br><br><br><br><div class="quote"> Some people see black and white. I can see a whole rainbow of opportunities! <br></div><br><br>Yes, sure. But BlitzMax had exactly the same opportunities, it's just that the decision was made to invest into a new product instead of adding all those features to the one with the great potential that was already out there. For example, Mark very specifically said that BlitzMax wouldn't ever get 64-Bit support, and a couple of days ago you, Brucey, posted that Monkey obviously could be used to create 64-Bit code. Well, since it "only" translates to other languages, this is hardly surprising, but still noteworthy in this context. We've also repeatedly heard the rumors that an ARM-back-end for the BlitzMax compiler was on the drafting board or in the works. Now Monkey can do it; it cannot talk to a database nor does it know how to do multi-threading , but at least it can create mobile phone games. <br><br>But which BRL product do you use when you want to create GUI apps for the desktop and a mobile phone? Unless Brucey decides to take Monkey to the next level by releasing his Qt port and porting a bunch of his other valuable modules, Monkey won't be an option - not even for non-games mobile phone apps.<br><br>Anyway. I think we've had similar discussions before, and the answer can only be an individual one. Personally, I'm not (yet) sold on Monkey and its promises. Its only interesting aspect for me at this point is its ability to create mobile phone apps, and here I must admit that I find the Corona SDK much more convincing. I haven't bought either product yet, and I will sit it out for a few more days. (I've also very recently bought a new house, and that project currently has a much higher priority anyway.)<br><br>I have an emotional weak spot for BRL products (and I like Zombie Trailer Park), so even if I think that Corona SDK looks more mature and complete, I probably will eventually still go for Monkey anyway.<br><br>Well, let's wait and see what will happen. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

New front-end, no back-end. Backends are hard to develop and not very interesting to most people (I don't know what Mark enjoys doing, but from the other products front-end seems like a good bet). Front-ends are where the real fun is, and are a lot easier to write; not only that, but he's developed six products by working on one rather than having to redevelop the same thing six times with little ability to share implementation details. This is a big deal.<br><br>2) Which end do users care about? It's true that the BlitzMax compiler was an order-of-magnitude leap forward from Classic Blitz (term I am going to use from now on for +/3D), but people who use it mainly do so because of the friendly syntax and large variety of modules. Front-end stuff.<br><br>Combine this with the fact that no matter how good Mark is, he's never going to write a compiler that can compete with GCC on the -O3 setting, and it becomes obvious that the effort in writing backends is largely not being appreciated by the intended audience. Instead... how about giving the people what they actually <i>ask</i> for (constant arguing over properties and operator overloading), and let GCC and other extremely mature compilers (that already have backends for every hardware platform more complex than a lightswitch) do the heavy lifting in the background.<br><br>It's not cynical, it's a good design decision that takes advantage of existing tools.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Pascal was one of the strictest languages (and for good reasons) that I've ever used, but even Niklas Wirth didn't believe that his language should also be case sensitive. I don't see that necessity either, especially not when the language itself is case-insensitive and applies case sensitivity only on identifiers. All other case sensitive-languages that I know enforce that case sensitivity everywhere for consistency. I think mixing case sensitivity and insensitivity rules in a language is a bad idea -- either be strict all the way or not strict at all.

The two axes of static vs. dynamic and explicit vs implicit declarations aren't connected:<br><br>Dynamic typing is where variables have no type discernible at compile-time. JavaScript is an example of this: you can put an int, a string or an object with any fields into any variable at any time. The only restriction being that some operations might not be legal; the compiler won't stop you putting floats and objects in the same variable and you might get bugs like trying to access a field of a float.<br><br>Static typing is where the compiler tries to enforce type-safety at compile time, which usually translates to "strong" or "weak"-ly static. Blitz languages and Java are moderately strongly-typed, because there's no possibility in normal code to make actual type errors: you can't end up with the bug described above. C and C++ are not strongly typed (even though they <i>are</i> superstrict) since they allow infinite type casting in infinite combinations, and thus the compiler's type checking can easily be defeated.<br><br>Finally there's inferred or implicit type. In C# this is where you declare a variable with "var" - but this <b>isn't</b> dynamic. The variable will be strongly typed to the type of whatever you put in it at initialization, and cannot hold values of other types. The only advantage this confers is so you don't have to write the signature out again if it's something long like a generic type nested five deep. SO this is just a syntactic sugar and has no connection at all to the dynamic typing of JavaScript, Python or Lisp.<br><br>Some languages like Haskell take this to extremes: by having very strong typing they actually make it unnecessary to declare types for the vast majority of variables simply because the behaviour for the values is so well-defined that the compiler can work out the types of variables and expressions on its own (look up Hindley-Milner type inference). Again, this has nothing to do with dynamic typing, even though no type is visibly declared.<br><br>I think we're on the same page about Blitz though. If you want an int, declare an int.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So implicits (and definetly dynamics) are most certainly not my bag! :D<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
