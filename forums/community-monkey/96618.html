But... Hasn't Java been trying to achieve this goal for one and a half decades now? "Java: One language for all platforms, and one platform for all hardware architectures." And isn't the Mono community trying to do the same thing with C# and their implementation of the .NET framework? And then there is Python.<br><br>But in the end, for some strange reason, all the great successes are still using... C and C++.<br><br>Anyway. monkey's feature set looks VERY small when compared to BlitzMax and its third party ecosystem, and monkey, at this point, really is just a solution for pure game development. If that's all what you want to do with a programming language, then it's probably a good choice. But if you want to do more with it without writing all the wrappers yourself, then monkey is still in its infancy and not the way to go.<br><br>Personally, I would have preferred more platform support for good old BlitzMax instead of yet another "new" language. But that's just me, looking at it from a remote perspective. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Java has loads of things that Monkey has and it has cross platform capabilities with most platforms as well.<br><br>Questions like these are really chicken/egg things where no matter what is added to something there will always be something missing that a programmer wants, for me monkey would benefit from networking, decent sound systems and then it will be complete enough for prime time. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But then you are on C/C++/ObjC/C#/Java(script) level anyway. <br><br>It all depends what you need and for which platforms you want to develop. Monkey is VERY open.

They then recreate the target on all of the supported platforms. Subtle but important difference. The languages that target a single runtime on top of many platforms will always be more consistent, stable, reliable and extendable, but also less efficient. It's a matter of priorities.<br><br><div class="quote"> all the great successes are still using... C and C++ <br></div><br><br>All the <i>great</i> successes don't attempt to use a single language for projects.<br><br>This is probably the most important principle to learn in the field of applying languages to software problems: use the right tool for the right task. A large project isn't one monolithic task, it's several tasks that can be addressed separately. Every large-scale game project has an integrated high-level scripting language, so that the parts that don't have to be fast can instead be written clearly and without bugs. Business projects may have more layers with multiple tiers of abstraction.<br><br>Actually this is in my own opinion one of the long-term obstacles to BlitzMax and Monkey's maturity: they actively discourage this sort of planning in an attempt to solve the whole problem with one tool, which inevitably isn't really as good at either aspect of development. You more or less have an artificial upper cap on project size and complexity as a result. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
