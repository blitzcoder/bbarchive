I realise it varies between hardware, but I'm finding that the exact same code runs quite a bit slower on Monkey than it does on Blitzmax. I've taken a simple sprite test, and run it on the same machine on both languages, and BMX seems happy to run 3000 sprites without any issues, but Monkey is slowing down a bit with that many.<br><br>I don't think it's a major issue anyway, 2000 sprites is enough for any game and it's worth it to have a game running in a browser :)<br><br>Or maybe I'm doing something wrong? Are other people able to get BMX performance with Monkey?<br><br>Secondly, just a minor question, could somebody link me the documentation for the Include statement for Monkey? It crashes whenever I hit F1 and I'm being forced to use Import, which is causing a bug in my code (not sure why). I think using Include would simplify it at this stage.<br><br>I should point out I'm using the demo, which seems quite a long way out of date. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

For most purposes this *should* be equivalent in speed or potentially as much as twice as fast as BlitzMax, at the language level, because current C++ compilers have obscenely powerful optimisers, and thus produce excellent code.<br><br>You also have to consider the effect of the platform used to run the game. C++ and Flash targets should be constant across different systems and mainly affected by the hardware, since C++ of course compiles to native code, and Flash has only the one implementation. But there's a huge gulf of performance difference between the .NET and Mono implementations of the CLR, should you get adventurous with the C# backend; there are several different Java implementations in common use (although this would require some tweaking since the Java target I believe is intended solely for Android), and of course HTML5 performance will be determined primarily by which browser the user tried to use, and how the browsers are competing this month.<br><br>Consider also that CLR, Java and JavaScript all make heavy use of JITting, polymorphic inline caching, dynamic recompilation and other buzzwords that completely change the performance <i>characteristics</i> of the result program, as well as the performance average (i.e. usually means they will start slowly but have the potential to accelerate to C++-speeds if run for a few minutes). I don't know for sure but I assume that Objective-C and C++ targets are using reference counting rather than garbage collection, as well, which will make for more reliably consistent performance without necessarily making them faster overall.<br><br>In other words, yes, but it depends what you set out to do, and what you want to build for; and it's not really a fair comparison in a lot of cases. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I guess one way to look at it is, if it runs 2000 sprites on my PC, it should probably run fairly well with 100 sprites on most platforms. Unfortunately I don't have access to any other platforms to make tests - I should probably grab hold of a cheap phone or something to play around with because I think they're much slower than PC's in general?<br><br>Regarding the Include/Import issue. It's occured to me that I don't actually understand the difference between the two, even in BMAX. I just use Include because that seems to do what I want, i.e split my program into smaller chunks. Not sure why it doesn't work in Monkey, although it's probably just a bug in the demo. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
