My personal favorite is Firefox 4, but all three are great browsers and if you develop web applications, you should have them all installed anyway for testing purposes. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If they kept adding new bits to XP until 2014 people would still be making full and active use of it. We're into the cooldown period now: Microsoft's main concern with XP support is keeping it safe and stable, but they shouldn't be encouraging users to see it as something that will stay competitive by adding features or new software.<br><br>Anyway, Microsoft have to deal with not just lock-in but the support culture they've built around themselves (although the philosophy of eternal backward compatibility is a damn good one - but that's the opposite thing). The ridiculously long lifespan of their products (Windows 1.0 was still officially supported in 2001. That's the <i>21st century</i>.) has taught people that upgrading is an unfortunate inconvenience, to be avoided if possible, not something you do every six months as part of your automatic system update. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Irresponsible, really.<br> <br></div> Probably because the latest lightweight versions of linux can run on almost 20 year old hardware (if more than a little slow!)., and major release upgrades are freely available.<br><br>The difference is,  XP is totally capable of running "IE9" chrome and firefox alone testament to that. If anything the only possible -genuine- reason (other than making money of course) is it  is due to bad design by intergrating the browser so heavily into windows. If it is about money then there are to be honest FAR better ways of "forcing" users to upgrage by denying services, rather than sacrificing security.<br>Ok so you have to draw the line somewhere, but when half the planet are still using your OS you do not just cut them off (at least where security is concerned). No you wait until it is a good minority.<br><br>As for apple, i am surprised they are not yet charging by the click.
