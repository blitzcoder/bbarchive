You can't use C instead of C++ in complex applications, because C++ is designed to be C for complex applications. It's just as fast as C, since no human can optimize their code in C to match the C++ compiler optimizations. The same is exactly why C was developed: no human can optimize assembler code in the way how a C compiler optimizes it. C# was made up by Microsoft who don't care anything about elegancy or technology, they just want to rip the money from people. And the C# language was developed for people who make everything wrong all the time, that's why it's a managed language with garbage collection, and the end user has to suffer from the bloatedness and slowness of applications because the developer was not skilled enough and/or chose the wrong language. I don't support that principle, so I don't support C#.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

And it's not very efficient to have a slow performing program because garbage collections happens randomly in the most time critical places. There is absolutely no need for garbage collection when the language has scopes, like C++ has. Everything is freed immediately and from the stack, not from the heap only. The stack is about 4-20 times faster than the heap memory, and only C/C++ supports the stack memory.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That would be close to ideal for me (well, Monkey is missing few crucial things for my needs but still).<br><br>Now, to answer to the question, Unity or Monkey. My thinking is:<br>- Unity, if you want 3D (and don't mind the way Unity is coded). Unity has free version too so you can test it out and see it yourself.<br>- Monkey, if you want 2D (and especially if you like Blitz/basic type of syntax/way of doing things)<br><br>Also, it's worth considering:<br>- BlitzMax (for 2D, if you want more features - but less porting - than Monkey can offer)<br>- Leadwerks (for 3D, although it comes with a cost: right now it doesn't work on low end computers, you must have a pretty decent Graphics card. For example, all laptops cannot handle it, but all laptops can handle bmax, monkey, unity)<br><br>The thing is, there's always "I'd want to see feature A, B and C and then it would be perfect". That will never stop. What one must think that which features are ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED, and draw a line there. First write down what type of game you want to do, how much money you are willing to put to buying engine, how much time learning to use it and so on.<br><br>So, saying "which tool to choose: Unity or Monkey" depends what you feel are important. For example, it could be said that "3D" is a good thing, but if you want to do 2D, then actually Unity's "3D" is not so useful. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Said low-end machines would never be able to handle complex scenes anyway... to look at it from another angle, any program that can run on a low-end machine isn't an appropriate program to be developing in LE. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Therefore Unity will do whatever is needed to succeed in these areas. If a certain graphical feature is hip, it will be in Unity. If a bigger clients needs or a majority of the users want certain enhancements, they will be done. What you won't get this much is love to detail in areas which make sense but which aren't backed up by many users or aspects they just don't understand, like the joy of a beautiful language. Seriously they aren't tasteful enough to care about it. It took them more than five years to finally come up with an OnDestroy event or better array support in Unityscript.<br><br>.features<br>Unity today is a feature monster and it will continue to grow in this area. The good thing is that if you're more mainstream minded you'll be very happy. If you're more selective and beside of the mainstream it can happen that you don't need 70% of Unity's features whilst you will be waiting for years to get those 30% you badly want, did i say softbodies?<br><br>.bugs<br>Compared to others tools from the gamedev corner Unity is one of the more professional tools which you can still afford but it's also not as professional like many more serious applications. There are still tons of bugs inside Unity and they don't squish them all. If you aren't important to them and can't properly reproduce an error, it's of no interest to them, sometimes it even is if you can. They prefer fixing those which they can find easily. Only in cases where it turns out to be a showstopper they take care of it. Otherwise they lurk around in Unity. And Unity isn't even responsible for all of those bugs as many are inside the middlewares Unity uses.<br><br>.filesize<br>For the web Unity can, and once Allegorithmic's baby will be integrated, produce the smallest files available on the web. Once you have the plugin installed there is no better way to deliver your content but due to all the Mono components and so on, files distributed for iOS/Android or computer systems come with this typical MB bigpack on top. You can't produce small apps with Unity for these devices. No issue if your assets exceed those MBs with ease but it is an issue if you have to deliver lightweight apps.<br><br>.pricing<br>Unity wants you to get familiar with the product and buy Pro. That's the core of their business strategy, getting $1500 (plus 25% taxes) from you. From there on you can buy your way to other platforms for another hundreds (limited splash screen Indie) to thousands of dollars (full pro). The pricing for consoles isn't officially available. And this isn't a lifetime licence, so you need to renew these licences for every major version. Depending on how many platforms or licences you own this can get quite costy. On the other side they also add features very quickly. Obviously there also exists the Indie version but due to the limitations and if you're coming from a generous liecence like BlitzMax, chances exist that you won't like it.<br><br>.unity<br>Now beside of this tasteless greedy money sucking bug monster i described, Unity can be a lot of fun as well because as i wrote above compared to many other gamedev tools, it's still quite professional and many things work which aren't available or even more buggier in other tools. If you can ignore the ugly way to code then Unity has a lot to offer as well. The editor is extremely customiseable, Unity can deal with many formats, you can play around with shaders, you have a good 3d engine, physX, fmod, ... Whilst all components aren't perfectly integrated, you'll always find something to like and something to hate Unity for. Unity just isn't, let's do 10 things and let's do them right, that's Mark in my opinion. Unity is, let's do 100 things half baked and improve 70% of them over time. Still the best 3d app i own these days.<br><br>.2D<br>Now whilst it's known that 3D is their real baby, Unity will in its V3 product cycle also introduce a 2D engine, i guess sometime later this year.<br><br>.monkey<br>I already love my monkey! I won't give it away. :O) I think it's safe to say that this is the best application i purchased in 2011. But then again i'm not mainstream as well. As a sidenote, i haven't played a single really convincing Unity game so far. Obviously i don't question Unity's capability to be able to but for some strange reason it hasn't happened yet but i'm sure some day it will happen.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font><br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Not to diss it at all, it's pretty nice at doing what it can do. It probably is still better at 2D than Unity is, out of the box. But because it has a 2D pipeline it has always been struggling with 3D in which Unity shines.<br><br>Monkey looks quite nice, again for 2D, and it's neat how it can now get things to run on other platforms, and is cheaper than Unity for getting stuff onto the handhelds. But then it is missing so much that Unity offers.<br><br>The Unity editor is pretty nice, programming in Unity Script is not quite as nice as in Blitz but still pretty straightforward. The Unity documentation is far superior as is their all-round level of support. Their tutorial projects are excellent. They have their own yearly conference and show up in various other events. You can get games onto closed platforms through their Union program and they're constantly looking to add new platforms to their already wide selection.<br><br>They now have over 100 employees working on it and have experienced massive expansion in a short time. AND they care about proper promotion and marketing! The software supports 3D very well including shaders and deferred rendering and rendering to textures and shadows and lighting and physics and all that good stuff. The editor makes it easy to do things like creating terrains and focussing on the game design rather than programming, which can be a major drawback with Blitz - so much more has to be written by hand. Unity is a real time saver. Like Unity claims, they really do take a lot of the pain out of development.<br><br>At the moment, overall, I think Monkey/BMX have more of a handle on 2D and Unity is more focussed on 3D but there's some crossover for both of them. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Neither do i think that their tutorials are good and cover what you need to know to use Unity in a reasonable and effective way. There isn't any documentation on the coding languages. The once promised brick by brick video material is still missing. Easy exchange of the projects can be an issue.<br><br>Unity can take away a lot of what you otherwise would have to code on your own but this only is a benefit if you also need those features. Secondly after doing quite some projects in Unity i also think that you aren't saving this much time because on one side you save some time but on the other side you're spending more time on aspects which you otherwise wouldn't care about. And you can see this in the projects done with Unity. If properly done they all shine on certain aspects but boy do many of them lack in gameplay and design. Unity so far breeds exactly the games many of us were sick of by the big boys. And the best part is that those who were moaning about how the industry sucked are stepping into exactly those footsteps and they either don't care as they feel that they are now a part of it or they don't even recognise it.<br><br>And regarding the marketing that's true but this is a two sided sword as on one side this can open you some doors but on the other side you'll have to tolerate the same marketing crap on yourself when they are selling the highly anticipated whatever as gold to you. Unity for my personal taste is too much business, the founders, the company and a certain percentage of their user base. Now Mark could use some more marketing but hey better no signal on TV than a selling show 24 hours a day.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You can't use C instead of C++ in complex applications, because C++ is designed to be C for complex applications. It's just as fast as C, since no human can optimize their code in C to match the C++ compiler optimizations. The same is exactly why C was developed: no human can optimize assembler code in the way how a C compiler optimizes it. C# was made up by Microsoft who don't care anything about elegancy or technology, they just want to rip the money from people. And the C# language was developed for people who make everything wrong all the time, that's why it's a managed language with garbage collection, and the end user has to suffer from the bloatedness and slowness of applications because the developer was not skilled enough and/or chose the wrong language. I don't support that principle, so I don't support C#.<br> <br></div> I completely disagree. C# is actually a language hybrid made up of mostly refined Java standards.  Originally developed by MS, nowadays "C#"  is a cross platform and ISO standard, and the language &amp; .net's core standards are no longer controlled by MS at all. Plus it is not a case of people programming wrongly, it's a case of next generation programmers wanting to get stuff done quickly, reliably and cost effectively. If C# was still only in MS's camp i might agree, but with the open source implementations it has made it much more attractive.<br>I have said it before and i will say it again, if your core processing bits (eg 3d engine etc..) are written in C++ (which in this day and age is what it is best and good for) then who cares what you code with? <br>Writing ENTIRE apps in C++ is becomming as pointless as programming in pure ASM.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

What Unity offers like almost any other 3D engine out there is a orthogonal camera mode with which you can implement you own 2d engine.<br><br>So, can you do a 2D game in Unity? Yes. Can you use commands or a 2D engine which helps you doing so? No. Best you can do beside of writing all this on your own is to buy some third party extension for Unity which does that for you to some degree. But as written a few times before a 2D engine for Unity has been announced, whatever that means exactly. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
