Oh yeah, and design a project directory structure and maybe a front end with a 3rd party piece of software. There is a little company called (cough) microsft that I've been using for some front end-age, only coz I'm oh-fay with it.<br><br>The bonus about devving on phones is that it won't be so easy for me to sit there and ponder about 'I wonder if I can do that in B3D', invariably the answer is eventually yes but my ponderings are leading me to dev apps which take longer &amp; longer to reach fruition, ah well.

It's a joy to use, and obviously the app selection is tops. I am a cheapskate but it really is worth the difference.<br>Android: It's really neat, and I love the open concepts. However in the real world there are always problems that I just can't live with. Battery life, manually HAVING to manage your applications or your batter gets eaten even faster. The interface is designed for people who love linux, not people looking to get things done on a Phone, too many menus, it's very cold and digital feeling. The browser is a little choppy compared to iOS in actual use, etc. It is a fantastic system but it's no where near as polished as iOS.<br>RIM: It's a sinking ship, the app support is horrid, I don't like my data passing through their servers, I personally don't like their keyboards (which is the main draw), I see no point now that there's iOS and android devices.<br><br>Developer:<br>iOS: You need a mac to develop for it, but the returns can honestly make this trivial. my toy side projects paid for my phone, my dev account, a mac mini to get started, an upgrade to my phone, my dev account renewal, an iPad, and a mac pro to replace the mini... that's 2 crappy $1 apps I threw together just to familiarize myself with the SDK... the market is there, huge and hungry. the games side is quite busy but it's still THE place to be as a developer. Getting started can be daunting because Objective C syntax can mess with your head until you're used to it, but now it's totally natural. The community (official and otherwise) is very active so getting help is generally very easy. The documentation is very complete. Basically it's the leader on all fronts for a reason.<br>Android: The barrier of entry is technically much lower, free dev kit, don't have to use the market if you don't want, and it's only like $20 instead of apple's $100 to get into. More device selection. And you write java which is easier to get your head around, no approval process, just upload and you're online. the flip side is the turnover on the market seems FAR lower than iOS, you can't expect to make nearly as much money as easily. The market is quite hostile to developers compared to the apple's app store. Users can return your software easily, the market is generally very hard to navigate so being found is much harder, etc. IMO Java is a terrible language for mobile devices. The Garbage collector kills system performance and resource handling. Java is inherently slower than highly optimized fully compiled C family code. You can mix in C++ via the NDK but in my attempts it's just not even worth thinking about, I was better off re-writing everything in Java. On top of that Android can run on different processors so if you compile C++ it won't always work because the processor might not be arm, it might be x86... Then there's testing. the simulator is awful, crazy slow and doesn't accurately simulate the hardware so anything beyond GUI elements might cause it to fail totally. Then hardware, there's SO many android devices and they're all different, there's no way to vet your code, you just have to do your best, test on as many devices as you can, and hope there's no problems on stuff you can't try. 8+ screen sizes without factoring in tablets, not all devices have touch screens, etc. you have to do lots of untested contingency planning. Documentation for the SDK I find confusing an un-informative. The community is all over the place so getting help can be tricky.<br>RIM: Don't have a TON of experience here but it's JAVA based like Android, only the SDK is a mess. There is no community to speak of. Most RIM owners don't know there IS an app store. Just as many hardware fragmentation problems as android... unless someone is paying you there really is no point IMO.<br><br>All opinion. Regardless of what you go with for personal use iOS is THE platform to develop for, a used iPod touch is probably the cheapest way to get started, and because of apple's consistency it's technically all you need. The simulator can even get you 90% of the way there if you want to put off purchasing hardware. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

However you can use that mac to develop everything (ios and android, bmax for mac and windows, dual boot into windows for anything else...), and the app store will pay more than android market place if you're looking to turn a profit...<br><br>The startup costs IMO are worth it, but they VERY much are not trivial assuming you're starting from scratch.

But since then, Windows in any version is more likely to disgust me than any other platform - and I use Linux and Windows at work and OS X at home every day. In an ideal world, I would be using Linux for everything - but since it doesn't run apps like Photoshop or Aperture, it's only a great server platform, but not an option for my daily desktop needs.<br><br>The problem with the Mac keyboard is easily solved. I use a Microsoft Natural Keyboard 4000 and a Microsoft mouse with my Mac and both work very well. The only problem that I face now is the Display Target Mode of my 27" iMac: I have hooked up my Xbox 360 (with a Dr Bott converter) to my iMac, and only the original Mac keyboard  can switch the input between OS X and the Xbox. THAT sucks. ;-)<br><br>From a commercial perspective, none of this matters. At the moment, the only truly successful mobile platform is iOS, and if you want to write for iOS, you have to use a Mac. End of story.<br><br>I don't expect Android tablets to take off before the end of next year. And even then the question is if the industry really wants to consolidate on Android at all. It appears that all manufacturers are also working quietly on their own platforms like Bada, WebOS or even join the Microsoft train again. The market is fragmented and apparently still not going anywhere. iOS devices are the safest bet at the moment. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The reason being that other than Windows mobile (which is total cack) it is the only afaik one that is not bound to a specific manufacturer (unless HP have this model for Webos).  A multi platform OS is kind of attractive in itself to manufacturers in the same way that PCs being "Windows compatible" has been attractive for so many years, it means you only have to compete at a hardware level and not have a unique OS to push  that you hope to god succeeds as well (because if that fails your hardware, no matter how good.. fails too which i suspect was one of nokia's biggest problems -among many others).<br>-That is until something better.. or more importantly "more popular" comes along :D<br><br>PS: you can use photoshop on linux in wine (CS2 runs out of the box and i -think- CS3 can be made to work, dunno about the others) You could always use a photoshop autoloading VM (which is what i used to use until i discovered wine could do it).<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
