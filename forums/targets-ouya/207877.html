This image is used on the OUYA's main "Play" and "Discover" menus. For controller support you don't need the ODK because each button is mapped out to be treated like bluetooth keyboard strokes. But the OUYA "O" button isn't the "O" you would find on a physical keyboard, none of the buttons are the same letter as the keystrokes so Google which keys are equivalent for the OUYA buttons and you should be good to go.<br><br>I don't have more than 1 controller so IDK but you might need the ODK for multiple controller/player support. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.<br><br>I'm not certain how to use the joypads as they don't trigger a keyboard simulation like everything else does. This too might require the ODK.<br><br>I have, however, submitted a game to the OUYA store about 2 months ago that doesn't use the joypad (the D-pad instead) and it has no multiplayer and they approved the submission it has had over 100 downloads since I initially submitted it. So this does indicate depending on what you want your game to do, you won't need the ODK for anything other than the icon which is a pain in the butt.<br><br>If you'd like to see my OUYA game, it's called "Real Men Wear Pink HD" just search your Discover menu on your OUYA.

There's a nice banana he provided showing the use of the controllers. Check it out under banana\mak\joytest\joytest.monkey<br><br>The OUYA is very much Android, and as such, it follows most of the same rules. Using the ODK, you would get the benefits of IAP, and the naming/use of the controllers in OUYA. The OUYA controllers DO NOT map to keyboard commands. They follow (somewhat) the gamepad Android uses; however, I have seen discrepancies between other Android controllers and them with mapping differently. Mark did a great job getting the controls mapped to work as expected with Monkey's JOY*() command sets. You CAN use the KEY*() commands for the directional gamepad, but not the analog sticks.<br><br>I have 4 controllers on my OUYA, and I can use all of them at the same time as flawlessly as the OUYA allows them to be. There are some lag issues (I have the Kickstarter Limited Edition, so mine are flawed with much latency), but the newer controllers were updated to reduce the lag the originals experienced. I think I may have even wore out one of them already tho. :| <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The HOME button just killed the app and returned to the main menu. <br><br>There are many small issues that were discovered early on, but OUYA fixed or at least made them better.<br><br>1) Increased memory to 16 GB<br>2) Spent several revisions focused purely upon giving a way to the user to move files from the OUYA and put them on the USB storage. These games could also be launched directly from the storage device.<br>3) Improved the controllers and reduced the lag (especially the time it takes to link controllers to the OUYA)<br>4) Added a double-tap and single-tap to the HOME button that allows the programmer to use the Home button as a way to get to their own custom menu. Double-Tap quits the app.<br><br>The way I see OUYA is that they have listened to their users and responded with positive changes. They have done quite well making these changes despite the negative hits they have taken on while they worked on them. I think OUYA will stay around for quite a while even if its not the top end. They have hundreds of games available, all of which can be tried before buying if not free for the taking.<br><br>I use my OUYA quite regularly and almost more frequently than either of my XBOX ONE or 360. It runs quietly, and sips on power, all while never over-heating. I have no complaints about it functionally; however, I DO wish it could allow more than ONE user to login at a time. I use a 64 GB USB memory stick that has all my games installed upon it. It just works. <br><br>I agree that the biggest complaints today are the game selection... I'm really hearing Triple-A style games that are missing. There are TONS of low quality games, but that would be expected given that its as open as it is. Anyone can build something for it. There are several gems out there on it, you just have to look.<br><br>That's my two cents worth. You either like the device or you don't. I'll stick with the OUYA. :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

With Monkey-X, you should be able to directly connect the OUYA via mini USB to the PC USB port and fire up ANT.

I had to save up just to get BlitzMAX. It was a very good investment. I code in Monkey-X and BlitzMAX as a hobby. Eventually I'll release something on the OUYA. I don't use Windows much and do ALL my Monkey coding with Mollusk on a Mac. I'd love to see Jungle ported to Mac, but that won't happen. Ziggy uses VS.NET and Windows centric features.

Turn that on.  You'll have to do that every time you power cycle the device though, since the setting doesn't stick.  Then, on your Mac you run two commands from the command line:<br><br>adb tcpip 5555<br>adb connect 192.168.1.2 (or whatever the IP address of your Ouya is)<br><br>Once you've done that, when you compile to the Ouya target, after a few seconds the game will pop right up on the screen. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
