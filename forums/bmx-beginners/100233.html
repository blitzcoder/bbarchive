Part of this was counting how many times an object was constructed and destroyed and I came across this problem that I am curious about.<br>I have a menu function that returns an object that contains various objects to use in the game, yet when I pass these objects owned by the menu result object to other functions, the menu result object never gets destroyed even after setting it to null.  Here is the simplest example code as a runnable program:<br><br><pre class=code>
Type Interior
End Type

Type Exterior
	Field i:Interior

	Method New()
		Print "Constructor"
		i = New Interior
	End Method
	
	Method Delete()
		Print "Destructor"
	End Method
	
	Method GetInterior:Interior()
		Return i
	End Method
End Type



Function InteriorParameter(p:Interior)
End Function

Function CreateExterior:Exterior()
	Local e:Exterior = New Exterior
	Return e
End Function

Local f:Exterior = CreateExterior()
InteriorParameter(f.GetInterior())
f = Null

While(1)
	GCCollect()
	PollSystem()
Wend

</pre><br><br>CreateExterior() creates an exterior object that contains an interior object. The interior object is then passed to InteriorParameter() function, when done the reference to the exterior object is made null.<br><br>Even with the infinite loop at the end to stop the program ending before the garbage collector does its business, the f never seems to be destroyed. Take out the InteriorParameter call and everything works as expected. <br><br>Actually when typing this I discovered, it gets stranger, if I add the following function outside of any class<br><br><pre class=code>
Function ExteriorParameter(p:Exterior)
	InteriorParameter(p.GetInterior())
End Function
</pre><br><br>And I change the change the InteriorParameter(f.GetInterior()) line to ExteriorParameter(f) , everything get created and destroyed as you would expect.<br><br>What is causing this?<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Matt <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The program never ends so I had to terminate it.<br><br>I'm not sure how PollSystem works and thought maybe the OS needs more time. So I added a "Delay 100" to the final loop. Now "Destructor" did get printed. Maybe the object was being destroyed but for some reason the output wasn't shown.<br><br>After that I took out the Delay, so the code was again in its original form. This time "Destructor" was displayed. And that's with the same code which did not produce any output the first time.<br><br>So to summarize, I have no idea what is happening. But the endless loop with nothing but GCCollect and PollSystem feels wrong. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The fact that one of these situations still leaves it available for GCCollect is probably caused by a hidden factor (presumably something to do with total code size).<br><br>Two of the general guidelines about GC in any language are that finalisers are 1) allowed to run <i>when the runtime</i> decides they should, and 2) therefore may never run at all. The fact that it doesn't run immediately on the last reference being nulled is not in itself a bug, it could well be an optimisation; either removing a call it reckons is unnecessary, or pooling a bunch of small dead objects to free in one go later on.<br><br>You might be tempted to argue that this means the program has improper behaviour, because your destructor has an observable side effect which might never appear or might run at the wrong time - it doesn't; rather, this is a demonstration of why important stuff (certainly anything with observable effects) isn't supposed to go in finalisers. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That being said your code does use the variable with passing it into a function and so it will be created properly.<br><br>As Jesse already said, the inner workings of the GC do make it seem like it doesnt work properly especially with small examples like this.
