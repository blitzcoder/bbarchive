They are essentially the same as a global somewhere else, except that they happen to be better organised by being associated with the rest of the related stuff. Variables declared as "field" form part of each object - each <i>instance of</i> the type - that is created by calling "New thing". If you call "New" three times ("a = New thing; b = New thing; c = New thing"), three objects have been created and there are three sets of the <i>instance</i> variables (fields) "name" and "x", but all three share the <i>static</i> variable (global) "XSTART". If one sets it, the change is visible to the others.<br><br>Functions and methods are analogous to this. Functions are essentially the same as functions declared outside the type definition, as with globals. Since they aren't attached to a specific instance, they can't see instance variables (fields), only static ones (globals). They are usually used when you want to perform an operation that affects the static parts of the type (i.e. all instances), or when you want a custom object creation more interesting than just "New" (since making a new instance means you can't send a message to an existing instance).<br><br>Methods on the other hand operate like fields: conceptually, each instance gets its own ones and they exist within that object's scope. Therefore, they can see <i>that object's</i> fields, and modify them. The methods of the same name on two different objects exist in two different scopes; once can see the fields of the first object and one of the second object. This means that a method of object A will not necessarily do the same thing as a method with the same name of object B, as they are each affected by a different set of variables that they can see and modify. (Later you will learn that they can also have different executable code, which extends this same concept - that methods <i>belong to</i> individual objects - significantly.)<br><br>In other languages (if this helps you), these two concepts are referred to as "static methods" and "instance methods" respectively, because the first only operates on the static parts of the type-as-a-whole (it belongs to the whole type, or is shared by all instances of it), whereas the second operates on individual instances (it belongs to only one instance, and cannot affect others directly).<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

  Field name$
  Field x:float

Function Move( this:thing, distance:Float )
  this.x :+ distance
End Function</pre><br><br>Functions aren't "owned" by objects and therefore if you want one to manipulate an object, the object has to be passed in manually. Methods get access to their object automatically.<br><br>Note that the above example is only equivalent to your first code block in very simple cases, because it presumes from the outside what you want to happen when you send the "Move" message to a "thing". Because methods are "owned" by an object, it's entirely possible for the "thing" in question to actually run a completely different method body depending upon which implementations it owns (this is called "polymorphism", and is ~99% of why OOP is useful - but you'll get to it in due course).<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This is fundamentally different from procedural code (so it's natural to be a little confused), because in procedural code the data objects are passed to, or through, procedures that <i>act on</i> them in a kind of outside-in way. OOP is the opposite of this.<br><br>Perhaps you'll find it simpler if you forget altogether about functions and methods being related. It happens that they're <i>implemented</i> that way in BlitzMax, but conceptually they're not the same thing at all:<br><br><pre class=code>'Procedural:
ACTION (x) WITH (data object y)

'Object-oriented
(object y) PLEASE DO ("x")</pre><br><br>See the difference? Procedural code structures actions together to form algorithms. Object-oriented code doesn't do this: it merely asks objects to handle things internally. (In practice, all BlitzMax code is &gt;85% procedural, but we're being theoretical for a moment here.)<br><br>How (x) is handled in the first example is laid down by the algorithm. It might be possible to pass some modifier in as a flag or function pointer, but fundamentally it is a separate action that is applied <i>by the code structure</i> to the object. In the second, the algorithm doesn't incorporate (x), it merely knows that (y) is capable of handling it, and it makes the request to (y) to do so (in this case, by name, to emphasise the fact that the algorithm doesn't "have" or "own" (x)). (y) will then do it on its own terms. Importantly, this means that in the second example, the code structure <i>doesn't know</i> what code will be run as a result of the request: that code belongs only to (y); whereas in the first, even if it's variable, the code belongs to the outer structure.<br><br>So what a method really is is another kind of property of the object. It is distinct from a procedural function, which is a property of the code structure. You don't "call" a method like you call a function: you tell the object that you want <i>it</i> to either call the method or at least respond to it in some helpful way.<br><br>BlitzMax merely lets you define methods in a way that looks a lot like functions, because most of the time you'll use them in an interchangeable way. But it is important that you understand that they aren't the same thing at all.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
