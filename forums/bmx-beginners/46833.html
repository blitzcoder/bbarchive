There are various libraries and so on that Blitz has to access to build your executable file, which would be installed under the relevant operating systems.<br><br>You can't, for example, use the Mac version to build a Windows or Linux executable. It would be a really nice feature, but would presumably be a lot more involved.<br><br>What you can do is buy one version of BlitzMax, e.g. the Windows version, then you need to go and download also the Mac and Linux versions which are separate archives. You get all three versions for the one price so you don't have to pay extra - just have to do the extra downloads. You can keep them on your PC but if you want to use them to build Mac/Linux apps you will need a Mac or Linux operating system to run it in. You would then compile within that operating system to produce an exe for it.<br><br>So to make versions of your app/game/whatever for all three platforms, you do need access to all three platforms on which to compile it. Presumably you could install Linux on your PC as well as Windows which makes things a little simpler. I wouldn't be too surprised if it isn't long before we begin to see people offering `compilation services` to those that don't have the respective platforms they are targetting. I for one will probably have to contact my cousin to get him to compile the Windows/Linux versions.<br><br>I hope you aren't too disappointed to find out that you can't do it all from one IDE on one platform. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There is no install and if the application fails to launch a) try again tomorrow, b) get hold of a programmer and ask him to build one for you. I want them to be able to grab the latest developer version off the version control software, and the nightly build off the website, drop them in the same directory, and be able to see how much progress the programming teams have made - in terms that a graphics person can relate to. After all, working software is the primary measure of progress.<br><br>Once the game is done, yes by all means lets go through a thorough cross-platform testing phase. But <b>until then</b> could we please focus on getting production ready code and content?<br><br>As it is now we have to have seperate Mac and Windows boxes running behind the Linux box, serving no other discernable purpose what so ever, except checking out the project, compiling the source and uploading the binary to the FTP site once every 24 hours. And it's just not particularly cost effective to have two additional systems running 24/7 working a grand total of maybe 3 minutes every day, just for a nightly build feature. It's a waste of perfectly good resources that I'm sure could be put to better use. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
