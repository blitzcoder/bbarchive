So I started using "Self." before each field in each method but that was annoying and there was no guarantee that I remember to put that.<br>I saw some code that used underscores for fields of a type, and that code looked really scary to me do I didn't do that. I'm wondering whats the best way to do this? What does it mean if there is a underscore after the word? What about 2 underscores, I think I've seen that too.<br><br>What if fields required a "." before their name, when coding in methods? Wouldn't that be a good way to solve this problem? Of course I can't make the preprocessor work like that, but I was just wondering. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I should probably put my globals in types. I made an abstract type to hold globals and it worked but it didn't show their values in the debugger so I assumed that I am not supposed to do that. Could be a bug though.<br><br>Also a lot of my problem right now is that I have a lot of fields in my types, and when I make locals in methods I have to make sure that there isn't already a field with that name.
