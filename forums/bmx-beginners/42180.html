I ask because it used to be a very popular feature of games to DO something or show something while data is loading, e.g. a spinning disk, some small animation, or even continue with the full gameplay like in Swiv. How would somebody spool level data from disk in realtime while a game is still running? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It doesn't have to be fancy thread stuff. Then you can spawn a process to load files to a given memory buffer or whatever and meanwhile your game can continue doing something more useful.<br><br>If GUI's had no multithreading you'd be sitting waiting all the time for things to happen, rather than the GUI code being given a higher priority than other things. It wouldn't be responsive. In my view of software design, delays of any kind are unnatural and unacceptable. There is a lot of wasted time inbetween useful code that is wasted, as far as the user is concerned, waiting for stuff.<br><br>Indeed, another example would be that you have some intro animation thing which gets loaded then executed, and while it's running you should at least be loading the level data for the first level. Rather than waiting for the user to make selections in a menu you should be pre-empting their likely decision and loading stuff ahead of time so that their actual actions produce immediate consequences. It's actually dam annoying waiting around several seconds for something to load and being able to nothing about it. If a software publisher is not interested in how streamlined the file loading is and how often the user has to wait, I wouldn't use that publisher. And if it is a widespread attitude that it doesn't matter - maybe people need to do something to change that attitude. Until you show them how it can be done differently they might not even expect that it could be better.<br><br>Time spent looping through a little routine waiting for the user to click on a menu button could be better spend doing all kinds of computations and loading of data.<br><br>For BlitzMax, all you'd really need is a way to have data be loaded a little bit at a time and then be able to pause to do some processing. Streams sound ideal and maybe that's all we need. After all, if the disk access doesn't work with DMA (direct memory access) it will use CPU time. Even if you make things multitask with multiple processes or threads you still, actually, are probably only using 1 CPU and timesharing it. So you really only need a timesharing system between spending a little time reading data and spending the rest of the time doing stuff.<br><br>I remember the shootemup Swiv on the Amiga which got a lot of attention for being able to continuously load level data and gfx without ever having to stop, for continuous scrolling action.

(Since compilation time for the most part will be 0 as everything is already compiled).<br>c) Large scale multiplayer games, should create seperate threads for each client connection.
