To receap: BlitzPlus used an internal List to keep track of all types. In BlitzMAX this is no longer the case, but a linked list datatype (TList) is provided for you. If you only wish to use a single list to store a single type of objects this is possible too, James already has code that emulates the "old" Blitz way of doing things. (Basicly a Singleton Factory.)<br><br><div class="quote"> ....Its all going to take such a huge performance hit <br></div>Lists insert at constant time complexity, and itterate at linear - it is not possible to create a faster data structure for these two purposes. Added to that that BlitzMAX is nearly twice as fast as BlitzPlus, I seriously doubt you will have any external constraints on your performance. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
