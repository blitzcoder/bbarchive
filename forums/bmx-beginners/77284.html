Its also useful for speed tests, to find out the quickest way of doing something.<br>    I knew about Flip, but it also flips the front and back buffers, I just want to wait a Vertical blank, or a number of vertical blanks. Old Blitz used to let you do VWait n, where n was the number you wanted to wait.  I thought BlitzMax was meant to be an improved version of BlitzPlus, not a feature-reduced version? I guess there's ways round all these problems, but why not give people the choice? Its like the whole Gosub thing. I thought Gosubs were faster than functions and you don't have to worry about globalling variables and stuff.  Good for getting things up and working quickly as well, I always feel happier once I know I can actually do something, then I tend to function things later. What was the reason for taking them out?

I can't find this in BlitzMax (yet!)<br><br>This is old school thinking and is not something done now days on PCs. Your main loop should be time independent using MilliSecs() as a counter to time your movements, animation. If you just want to see how fast your main loop is going in ms, you can do this:<br><br>start = MilliSecs()<br>logic<br>render<br>speed = MilliSecs() - start<br><br>3. What is the equivalent of the Vwait command from the old Blitz (waits for the next vertical blank)<br><br>Research the Flip() command. You can run your main loop with no vsync waiting (which could cause graphic tearing) or with vsync on which causes the system to wait for the vblank before drawing anything.<br><br>4.

(especially in terms of drawing images and collision checks). Has anyone done any benchmark testing?<br><br>Brute code speed I understand it's faster or equal to most languages. Render speed is something totally different, Bmax used DX7 and there is no way to say "its faster or slower" than any other language. Internally there is no batching going on, so if another engine/language has batching support it will have a slight edge over BMax. But.... it's 2008, modern day cpu/gpu's should be capable of handling anything us Bmax coders throw at it.<br><br>Modern day PC game coding is a bit of an adventure, you're at the mercy of hardware, background apps, system hiccups, etc, etc. The best scenario is code for the worst case scenario and hope for the best. ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
