While Blitzmax would give you more flexability, RPGMaker is way faster at creating the FF-Style game you want (FF6 and prior) In fact one indie developer makes games with RPGMaker and sells them:<br><a href="http://www.amaranthia.com/" target="_blank">http://www.amaranthia.com/</a><br><br>Also, with RPGMakerVX you can customize just about anything if you understand the Ruby language.  You can even make a shmup with it!<br><br>With BlitzMax you don't have a map editor, nor do you have a fancy ingame gui module.  You'll have to make them yourself or most likely buy one (there's a lot of nice gui modules for blitzmax that would be GREAT for RPG's)  For an RPG You'll want some framework done for GUI/Maps and probably some other things as well.<br><br>As far as licensing goes, I'd contact BRL. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'm missing a finished path system, sound management, particles (although I'm considering timeline for that), Game GUI, a state system...<br><br>Right now theres boundless multi-later tiles, parallax and scrolling effects on any layer, gravity, friction, collision, actors with animation control, destructible layers, and a basic map editor.
