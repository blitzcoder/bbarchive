Perhaps it was Blitz3D I was reading about, because there don't seem to be any rudimentary functions native to all 2D game design, namely tile based scrolling, collision detection, and map rotation (All of which I had already been able to do with DarkBasic.) I asked if anyone knew of these things in another thread and was underwhelmed with the response. We should not have to re-invent the wheel every time we want to do these things, these things should be STANDARD in any "game design" language... Am I crazy? I asked if anyone knew of an example of a scrolling tile-based engine where the environment rotated around the player, and received a resounding "no." This is directed at the whole community.

That was not a good way to start, basicaly the package didnt do exactly what you wanted straight out of the Box, but as has been stated this is due to the lower level of the langauge as a whole. (As an asside you will find that a lot of ppl dont even use the functionality there and go to an even lower level, ignoring the functions and going straight to the objects)<br>It was not a good thing to do within your first dozen posts, on any board language. On TGC, people do the same and say things like, "Dark AI wont let me make an AI to play chess properly" or "Why isnt there a jetpack in FPSC, without it I cannot make my mega whatever".<br><br>If you have chosen to buy Bmax, then you realy should have looked at what the language could and couldnt do. If you get the hang of it , and (Which is probably more important), think that its the level that you want to program, then you will quite quickly come to see that being able to have your own code to do these things is a lot lot better than being stuck with someone elses.<br><br>If your "Right Brain" creativity, (That is going to come back and haunt you), means that you cannot get a grip on this level of programing, then simply move upwards on the programing ladder, until you find one that you like. This would include Modding, which athough looked down apon by some is a level that requies a very High level of creativity to make different from what you are modding, but it means that the full engine is already there. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Thats one of the reasons I implemented the DrawImageArea command quite fast because it is needed for some optimized things (tilemap for example with "binding" textures all the time is suicide. Doing it with batching is horror for pseudo depth sorting as BM does not support a depth)<br><br><br>Image buffers are a problem because of the OpenGL side, at least theoretically. It is not part of OpenGL 1.2 which is what BM set as base although it is that stone aged that it definitely would benefit of getting 1.3 (4) / DX9 as base instead of become more and more incompatible to current gen cards and systems. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In BlitzMax you have do do some more work - but that way you can optimize to a particular game and you get much better results.
