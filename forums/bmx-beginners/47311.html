Not exactly my intention, but when I see 'newbies' (I hate that word) posting saying "Let's make a game for fun and experience, oh my god it'll be, like, dude, so cool!", it just makes me want to jam sticks through their eyes.<br><br>So don't let me stop you, but be forewarned that nobody I have ever known has yet completed one of their "'newbies' join together and make a game" games.  So, the sooner you get over your inane ambitions of working with other 'newbies' to produce a game for fun, the sooner you can become jaded and evil like me.  And who doesn't want to be jaded and evil?<br><br>Edit: Let me try to explain why this is inane.<br><br>The concept of new users working together to create a game for fun is bad.  Now, you may think that the miniscule experience of each new user is added to the next, and so the experience builds up and you get a team of people with a large amount of experience overall -- this is incorrect thinking.  Experience is done via multiplication -- your experience multiplied by the other new user's experience detracts from experience overall.<br><br>So, let's say your experience is under 1.0, say 0.25.  Now let's say someone else's experience is 0.5.  The experience goes down, not up, whereas if you somehow illogically think in terms of additive experience it will go up.<br><br>Anyhow understand that illogical crap I just spewed? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Rather than experience being simply a number, simply a percentage of total blitz knowledge available, experience is a sector of blitz knowledge known.  Now I wont deny that there is some inefficiency when developers work together, sometimes alot of inefficiency.  But each developer has different experience, and the less experience each developer has the more chance that it doesn't overlap the experience of the other, and thus there is a great amount of rapid experience gain for each until they each have the same experience, which is the total area covered by each developers experience.  That was long, and makes sense in my head (i'm imagining some weird venn diagrams) but its 1:15 AM and Im not sure it will make sense written.<br><br>Anyway, Im not that bad of a Newbie, I've coded other things in other languages, and I've taken 4 weeks out of school to work on a blitzmax project so far (thats right, i didn't go into school for 4 solid weeks :D and just did blitz all day), I know there's allot I have to learn, but Im past the hard part of the learning curve and I can definitely hold my own in a standard blitz project with veteran devs. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
