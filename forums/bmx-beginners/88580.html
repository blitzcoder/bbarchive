Kind of like how you could read HTML to figure out what a page might look like but it's not exactly easy or obvious. When I come back to something months later, maybe on a bug hunt or expanding features, I don't want to have to remember or figure out what each part is doing.

I do this with each part of the game but in more detail after I finish making the general "map" of the game.<br><br>But at this stage I am not worried about programming at all. Once I have the most important features of each part of the game in a nice draft, I grab another piece of paper and start writting the programing requirements, all in a very general sense, without worrying too much on how I am going to code it, that part I do it while I am programming.<br><br>If I know I am going to need a method or type in the future, I just writte it on the code as a placeholder. The thing is, once you have decided on how the game is going to be, start working on it as fast as possible.<br><br>I found that this is a very agile way of programming, doesn't leave time for analisis paralisis.<br><br>The most important things to have in mind is to think that it is allways best to make re-usable code, so always think in modules. And also aim for getting to the prototype as fast as you can, if the game is not fun, no amount of good programming is going to save it. You have to balance this with the thought that you are going to keep building on top of your prototype though, but if you have this in mind it is not that hard to re-do parts of it to improve the prototype into a better game.<br><br>Of course, experience is the thing that is going to help you the most, so don't be afraid to make things badly at first, be bold enough to make mistakes and learn from them, do not worry about making everything perfect, rather aim for production, the more things you produce, the more you'll learn in a short period of time, I'm thinking about making lots of games, the more games you make, the better games you can make in the future.<br><br>I hope that helps.

Knowing exactly what you're going to do beforehand reduces the number of bugs you'll encounter and makes the tedious parts of the process go by much more quickly.<br><br>For my current game project, I'm not going to release the source, so I'm applying a lot of acronymns that I always use. (for example, I always use xx and yy for going through an array of coordinates, dx and dy for drawing stuff at coordinates, rot always stands for a rate of rotation and ang for an actual angle, etc.) I don't comment a lot, but instead I keep my variable names very consistent. I've never gone back to look at code I've written since I grew out of my "newbie" stage of coding and wondered what any portion of the code did. (Yet I am truly lost when looking at anybody else's code, no matter how seemingly simple its function)<br>However, in this game I'm making, moddability is a huge factor in quality so I've already begun minor documentation on it, even though the format's not 100% set in stone. This also helps me to remain concentrated on where I need to head.<br><br>I think documentation is an absolute requirement for anything the user is expected to do - even the smallest things as immediately obvious game controls. However, if you're the only one who's ever going to see your code, just keep a constant system so that you can tell what any piece of code does in only a few moments, even if you don't comment it. Though if you do something new, then you should definitely use easily comprehendable comments.<br><br>Also, if you're like me and value the fiished product over seeing the little things along the way, always start with the ground foundation and mundane code so you can focus on the actual game without worrying about coding these smaller things later.<br><br>Here's what I do to maximise efficiency when I program:<br>First, I spend no less than a week just coming up with a final technical concept on paper or in type and prototyping code. <br>Second, I get the basics - type strucures and the like - coded so that I don't need to worry about them later, aside from minor bugfixes.<br>Third, I get the gameplay functional. I don't know about others, but I always code the engine first, and then add the game content. I don't finalize or polish the game at this point, but I get it started and weed out all the bugs. Some of the media for the game (images, audio) gets done during this stage.<br>Fourthly, I spend some time deciding exactly how the game should play and look and feel, if I haven't already. Then I get to work on the content, which is always the fun part, at least for me.<br>Then, lastly, after I've finished the game, I playtest thoroughly to eliminate the last of the bugs and I try to get others to test it as well. I also polish the little things to turn it into a completely presentable game.<br><br><br>Yea, I know. I haven't got a whole lot to show for this method, but that's only because few of my games actually end up seeing public release for one reason or another. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
