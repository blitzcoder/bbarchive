It's very easy to make bad music (just as easy as badly making any other type of art, really).<br>I can only say, try to listen to a lot of game tunes that sound the way you want yours to be, and try to understand what makes them catchy. Is it the rythm? the harmony? the melody(ies)? also, count the number of instruments used in each track to get you some reference.<br>Then try to <a href="/posts.php?topic=87722" target="_blank">reproduce that</a>, but giving your twist of course. Seek freeware or commercial sequencers and start gathering [good quality] samples and soundfonts.<br><br>Remember to search for sources of information and articles regarding electronic\game music composition (or just simply "music composition". Composing for games is a specialization); there are a few good ones at Gamasutra, and there is a full forum section at GameDev.net reserved for Music and Sound effect <a href="http://www.gamedev.net/community/forums/forum.asp?forum_id=19" target="_blank">development and discussion</a>. <br>Some people who frequent there have actual professional experience in the matter, and can give some <a href="http://www.gamedev.net/community/forums/topic.asp?topic_id=472884" target="_blank">nice advice</a>.<br><br>Remember that no matter the number of instruments used, it's their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qYTV9X4lzs" target="_blank">interaction</a> that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irKUttTwp_Y" target="_blank">makes things</a> sound <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkp4GcOoP70" target="_blank">great</a> (all these tracks were sequenced by professionals for the N64).<br><br>Seriously though, you can't just go and make something sound wonderful. If you don't study hard, it just won't come up. <br>You can't draw if you never draw. <br>You can't paint if you never paint.<br>You can't compose if you never compose.<br><br>It's a matter of lots³ of practice, rest, and carefully listening to professional works; rinse and repeat.<br><br>Man, I should follow my own advice :( <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

At least MPlugTracker can export both MODs and render WAVs.<br><br>You can also try sequencers like Cubase, Cakewalk or the one I recommend the most: Fruity Loops (actually, it's being called FLStudio now). For these you'll have to spend money.<br>These work with patterns, piano rolls and you have much more control over mixing and plugin FX like flanging, phase, reverb etc.<br><br>As for samples...I can only recommend you seek for <b>General Midi soundfonts</b>. These are SF2 files that contain the entire range of 128 MIDI instruments, but with stereo samples and [generally] high quality - these go from a piano to woods, brass, strings and pop instruments. <br>IIRC, you can use these with the MOD\IT\S3M trackers (I use sfonts with FLStudio).<br><br>With soundfonts, it generally goes by the rule that the bigger are better, although there are some 200 MB ones that sound like crap.<br>You might want to google "best free GM soundfont" so you can view some forums where people have reviewed some of them.<br><br>The good thing about soundfonts is that instead of having to worry about tons of separate samples, the samples are all embedded in a single file and the best ones usually have multiple velocities for each note. It's much easier to use. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
