If that variable exists from the start of the function, it doesn't hurt anything, it just goes unused until the code reaches the loop. If another loop also has an inner variable it would presumably overwrite the same space, and no-one would be the wiser.<br><br><i>Some</i> languages will reallocate the loop's subframe each time, but that's usually because they support lexical closures (i.e. call frames are objects) and past iterations may need to persist (e.g. Scheme's "named let" does what you're thinking of). BlitzMax doesn't need to do that. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Anything else would just be inefficient.<br><br>Anyway, unless BlitzMax uses a radically unusual method of allocating call frames, the difference is irrelevant because locals are put either on the stack or in registers; you don't really "allocate" stack space, because it's already there; you just move the pointer for the current frame up beyond the locals of the previous one (note that this effectively means that you don't really allocate locals at all - they're just "there" in the space beyond the current top of the stack). The GC never kicks in at all, because call frames aren't objects, and don't need to be freed.<br><br>The short answer is that Mark would have to go out of his way to make the first option any less efficient; and in fact in the few cases where there's any difference it's likely to be the more efficient option because it gives slightly more opportunities for sharing space.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Do you fully understand types in Blitz?<br><br>User-defined types create objects. These need to be allocated on the heap when new ones are created with New. Therefore, your latest examples involve one piece of code where an object is created once, and one piece of code where an object is created ten times, and each time the new <i>reference</i> - a pointer to the heap object - assigned to the variable.<br><br>In the original examples in post #1, <i>no objects</i> are being created at any point. Integers are passed between variables <i>by value</i>, and don't refer to anything allocated on the heap. Therefore in those original examples, nothing new is allocated each iteration of the loop, only copied. Local variables are <i>not</i> allocated on the heap either. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
