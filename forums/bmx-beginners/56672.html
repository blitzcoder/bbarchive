Now however I'm completely into the whole bmax type stuff. ^_^"<br><br><br>Oh I use types, all the time.  But it took me several days to "get" them, because the examples provided weren't very good.  I think I understood they were like structures in C fairly quick, but I didn't get the whole "linked list" nature of them.<br><br>Speaking of which... Blitzmax does still do that linked list thing with types doesn't it?  Please?  Oh... I have a bad feeling about this.  I hope Mark didn't decide  to get rid of those.  That would mean every program which uses linked lists to maintain lists of things would have to use different variable names to iterate through the list, and that's not very nice when I want someone to be able to access my list of particles and iterate through it.  I guess it would be less wasteful or memory maybe, but... :-(<br><br>Also, another gripe:  In the Language section of the docs it says "types".  When I click that I get the different data types, not information about how "types" work.  Maybe Mark should have called them classes instead.<br><br>I see the Type entry now though under Blitz Runtime... And I see EachIn... But that doesn't seem to relate to types.  But rather, some kind of array.<br><br>And the code there is comfusing and doesn't explain itself:<br><br><pre class=code>
Local a[]=[0,5,12,13,20]

for b=eachin a
	print b
next
</pre><br><br>That a[] is clearly an array.  And those numbers are clearly being placed into that array.  A convenient feature that C and Pascal both had.  But there's no number in the array to indicate its size.  Does Blitz make the array whatever size is needed to fit the data being assinged to it?  And are the arrays accessed starting at 0?  And if I have an array with 10 elements, does it go from 0..9 instead of 0..10 like in all other versions of Blitz because beginners don't realise they're supposed to start at 0 and Mark is holding their hand? :-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So why would I need something that forces me to put that method into each of those functions?  Either I put a call to that in my code, and it errors during compile and won't let me run the program, or I don't, and it doesn't matter that I haven't added that method to one of the types.<br><br>The only thing I can figure on is if you were wiritng a lib and didn't actually call your types, you might want to have that to make sure you didn't forget one.
