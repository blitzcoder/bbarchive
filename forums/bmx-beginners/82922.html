You never did tell me how they're defined though.<br><br>I thought they might be defined as, for example, people who buy and play games on Steam, but from their hardware survey, between 45% and 65% ( depending on where the 20% of "others" fall ) of Steam users don't have a graphics card which meets the recommended specs of the engine you're advocating, so I'm thinking that must not be the right definition. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you have massive requirements always be aware that you also better have the required quality or you are dead targetting your game. And HD AA+ content isn't exactly cheap ... 10+ artists 1+ year ... so take that 1M++ into your consideration when comparing to "real games" because shit games with high requirements just sell shit as Crysis has proofen once and for all.<br>And as a small indie you are not in the position to cut 90% - 98% of the potential userbase.<br><br>And if you went for higher end tech pure OpenGL, you would use the C4 engine, it at least has crysis comparable features with its visual shader editor and the voxel 3d terrain system.<br>Otherwise take TGEA or Unity3D (soon on Windows)<br><br>but back on topic: BM is a great language if you don't want to spent forever learning highly complex languages and all of their core libraries.<br>It might not have direct 3D support but something like Flow3D or Xors3D definitely compensate for that and in both cases they are easy to use and run on a large amount of systems while still offering you higher end features for the more powerfull systems. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
