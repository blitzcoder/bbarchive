Enemy1 is not a type, it's an instance. I assume what you're trying to do here is get the same instance created earlier and assigned to the variable Enemy1 that was local to the function EnemySpawn2. Let's just say you don't do it like that - after the colon can only ever be the name of the <i>type</i> of object. It cannot be a value. Leading into...<br><br>2) The variable Enemy1 is <b>Local</b> to the EnemySpawn2 function. It is a slot created on the stack when the function is invoked, and eliminated when the function returns. If the function were to call itself, the second invocation of the function would have a <i>different slot</i> that it referred to by that name; and using that name outside the function either refers to a completely unrelated variable that just happens to have the same name, or is an error (depending on whether you declared it in the outer scope). Scope is <i>the</i> most important thing to learn in procedural and OO programming, so... you might need to scale back to a smaller example if you haven't got a handle on it yet.<br><br>3) The <i>whole</i> point of functions is that they operate <i>on data</i>, taking parameter values and doing something to them before returning a result value. Your DamageTarget function can't work, because... it has no target! The list is completely irrelevant to this: what you want it to select the target by some means unconnected to the damage procedure, and <i>pass in</i> the target as a parameter:<br><br><pre class=code>Function DamageTarget(tgt:TEnemy)
    tgt.TakeDamage()
End Function</pre><br><br>(Let's ignore for the moment that if you can get tgt, you can just call the method on tgt: that's a detail of what DamageTarget happens to do right now.)<br><br>A function without parameters is crippled and essentially can't do its job, because there is no way to pass data in! (A method is just a function with special syntax for passing the "self" parameter in automatically.) If you didn't know about declaring parameters... that revelation may have made a few things a bit easier. A useful function should <i>never</i> have to guess the thing it's supposed to operate on without context, which is why this question is so hard to answer: to be brutally honest, the above approach is not even close to the right way to do this.<br><br><br>You've identified the problem through experiment, i.e. you can't easily pass data between scopes. I would very much recommend you take a big step back and try to get comfortable with functions, parameter passing, returned values, and local scopes, <i>before</i> you try to make something involving a large and complicated type hierarchy (since types are a theoretical extension of function scopes, they'll never completely make sense unless you understand functions first).<br><br>(Sorry if I come across as brusque. It's just that there's quite a lot to learn here: you'll want to break up the relevant topics into two or three "things" to cover separately.) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Constructive critique hardly offends, and when asking for help sometimes tough-to-hear advice is best. I was trying to consolidate a lot of spaghetti code I made into something that was less 18 pages and Global x=value for 50 lines.<br><br>The thing is I actually understand how to manipulate most the data I want to, but it seemed Tlists were an easier way to do things like update() and manage certain params in the gamestate.  TBH the spaghetti code was actually better, while less efficient, it did what I wanted it to do.<br><br>I have a SelectEnemy type Function setup that will put the next enemy in focus. It will just look through the enemy's stats based on the number of enemies. Then I can run Damage() that will subtract health based on the enemy selected or whatever function I want because it's all Global at that point. I was trying to put all of the enemies in a list, because... it seemed like the right thing to do but it hid all the data from everything.<br><br>I'm guessing from the responses, Lists was just making it overly complicated, but I started playing with this idea because almost every single example in the tutorial and built in source examples, uses it somehow, somewhere, which perhaps was a bit misleading. Consider I'm not passing any data where 'real-time' or FPS is concerned (turn based game) then I don't guess being uber-efficient with storage is going to make a huge impact on the game.... 16 enemies with health and a couple stats, really isn't a huge amount of variables but it sure did look like a lot on the screen.<br><br>Much like I've learned from music production, there's always a way to do things in an environment with guidelines representing core ideas ,but then there is a BETTER way to do it.... just trying to approach this on how to do things better than what I've done already.<br><br>Thank you though for the explanation on orientation a bit more.

That's why you can add a local Enemy1:TEnemy inside a function. This Enemy will live also outside. His name "Enemy1" is not longer connected with him, but he lives.<br><br>That the reason, why you can do that:<br><br><pre class=code>For e = 1 to 5
     EnemySpawn(e)

Function EnemySpawn(e:int)
	Local Enemy1:TEnemy = New TEnemy
	Enemy1.Health=123

	List.AddLast Enemy1
End Function</pre><br><br>at the end you will have 5 enemys, all created under the name Enemy1, but all are independent. The ID is only for you, so you can identify each of them.<br><br>If you now want to substract something from fields of the enemys you can do it like that:<br><br><pre class=code>
For Local locEnemy:TEnemy = EachIn List
	locEnemy.Health=locEnemy.Health-10
