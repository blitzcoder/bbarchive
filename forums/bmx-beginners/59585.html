I get the functions and methods, it's more the concept I'm struggling with. I know that a list is less than ideal for what I'm doing, but without proper documentation, I have no idea if TMap would be better.<br><br>Am I right in thinking that the Key might often be a string, and that the string is used to look up entries in a map? Kinda like an index in a book? What else might I use if not a string? Any UDT? <br><br>Could it, in fact, be used to resolve my other problem posted in this forum regarding "instanced" types? IE: Post the key as the image object and the value as the new image object, when it is replaced. Then simply tell all game objects to look up the value attached to the key they already have and replace the image ( currently the key ) with the value ( the new image ) ?<br><br><div class="quote"> everything else can be found in the module sources.  <br></div><br>Yes, I'm going through the module source now. However, I feel obliged to mention that reading through source and figuring it out for yourself is fine when you're using a freeware product, but a bit much when you've bought a commercial product. And one that's been out for a pretty long time now. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But it would need testing to see if it is fast enough or if a simple list within a new image type would be a better idea. (the list then would hold all instances using this image)<br><br><br>I'm not sure that TMap was meant to be used from outside ... It was needed for some internal things ... So it just got not documented.<br>As I'm using Hotdocs I don't mind much if it is documented or not as the OO part is not that documented anyway. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I understand Wave's example just fine, but it's too basic and only covers the stuff I figured out on my own. GMan's example covers a lot more, and I see what he's doing, but I don't quite see the purpose of the enum stuff.<br><br>But I think I understand enough to use these to fix my graphics reloading problems, and it will be completely seamless once I abstract the load and unload functions, which is great. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
