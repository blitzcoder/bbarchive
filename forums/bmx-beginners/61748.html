Why it have 'color' attribute then ? (waste memory, break clean object attribs)<br><br>2. I have my 'own' system, which do something. I have 'myClass' and 'myClass2'. I want myClass2 to support 'image' - how ? I can't derive from '2' basic classes ! (the only lang can do it is c++ and it brings nmany problems). Delphi (pascal), c#, java , ... none of this langs support derive from 2 ancestors (he can argue only by interfaces, which are *NOT* deriving - even C++ can implement<br>interfaces on deriving layer - but jsut because yuou can have 2 paretnts - and as I say, no other lang is known to me :)<br><br>3. what happends, when I will add in MY object "rotation" - and later, in new version, author of original base class will also add "rotation" - to *ALL* objects -&gt; it will conflict with my own declaration and program will stop work<br><br>4. what will happen, when multiple 'version' need to be used as DLL's ? This is not big problems for interpretting langauges, but for c/c++ like langs this is killer problem - all versions need to be EXACLY the same<br><br>5. if object needs 10 colors, you can't just use 'color cols[10]' because you need to fuck around with 'color' - many other part of system could reference 'color' -&gt; another complication<br><br>6. with deriving, you have no control over usage of yourself - any1 can override methods, change things, ... -&gt; in longer time terms (more ppl, bigger projects) -&gt; problems [and some pubpic/private/... is *NOT* enough !)<br><br>7. sharing variables is very dumb - if you expect somethign to be nto change during 'some call' - you can't rely on that... and you have no control -&gt; the bst way for deriving is to not share varaibles - but jsut methods (some programmers using derivating acknowledge this is to be the only good practive) -&gt; you lost one of biggest advantages of deriving<br><br>------ ------ ------ ------<br><br><br>imagine you have 'file' class<br>it ahve methods like<br>read<br>write<br>you know, file is *SLOW*.<br>so, I will do<br>type cached_file Extends  File;<br>and now I will show you, how easily inheritance goes to ass.<br>I defined some methods which 'enahce' file about 'cache'<br>eg,. you called "read"<br>it reads BLOCK<br>from 'base' class<br>and 'reads' from that 'cache'<br>so, both objects have 'read'<br>but<br>cached_file read reads jsut 'aray'<br>and if array is 'empty' then it calls<br>'read' of basic class (file)<br>everything works fine.<br>but there are 2 problems:<br>(big one)<br>let's say I will add NEW method to 'file' - eg. "search"<br>it searchs file and set position to 'some' specified place.<br>but I dodn't modify "cached_file"<br>so what happends ?<br>base class searchs &amp; seek but 'cached_file' didn't update it's buffer.<br>so, if you use 'cached_file.find' (which you have from base class !)<br>your code no longer works.<br>another problem is, <br>if you use 'cached_stream' as "base" class.<br>and do<br>base.read<br>which METHOD will be called ?<br>cached_file.read<br>_or_<br>file.read<br>this is BIG problem./<br>this one can be solved - usually using 'virtual' methods (here you can see, it REQUIRE special implementaion frmo language !!!)<br>and first problem ?<br>can't be solved !<br>and this is the most pissed thing on deriving:<br>if you setup 'base' classes - you can't change them too much anymore......<br>you never know, how ppl use you.<br>so, if you are the only programmer, do not share anything, deriving could be acceptable options.<br>in any other ways, deriving failures for MANY reasons.<br></i><br><br>note that I can't really comment on inheritence, it's not my thing.. so these are his words, if someone reacts I'll redirect him to this thread and post the reply..

End Type</textarea><br>What Im am doing is defineing the most basic things LEDs need, and then inhereted these to make each of the subsequent types. As you can see I dont have to worry about all that changecolour or rotation crap, because the TLEDAlien already has them (from TLED), I could easyerly make it a field, and then either write draw calls that call the fields draw, or call the fields draw directly. BUT TLedAlien.draw and TLed.Draw, are the same routine, so no extra work there<br><br>Your Points<br><br>1) If B doesnt need any colour, then you shouldnt try and inheret from a class that has colour. (This is a planing problem, not an inherent problem with Inhereting)<br><br>2) Type A<br>   Type b extens A<br>   Type c extends B<br><br>3) a) they are my base objects, so Iam the author, and I dont do that (well not very often)<br>   b) Unless the rotation method is really stupidly done, you can just override it<br><br>4) Dont know. I wouldnt know how to do that in any languge.<br>But my understanding is that its the interface of the object that is important, and that has no relation to inheriting or not. Its surly, (If a problem at all), a problem about compilation<br><br>5) I have no idea what hes trying to say? If an object needed 10 colours, it needs 10 colours. (I think this was an argumnet used against useing types at all, rather than an argument against inheriting)<br><br>6) Errr and, thats not an arugument against you useing inhereting, is againt letting anyone else inhereting your stuff.<br><br>7) Is that about "Unions" cos it is totaly irrelivent to inhereting. Again I think that was an argument against types full stop.<br><br>And that entire monologue. He just need to learn how to use super. The entire monolouge is infact againt overriding in inhereted classes, and not inhereting in of itself<br><br>EDIT: In fact after reading you post again, and flash scanning the links, I think that your stance is against OOP, and not against inhereting. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

As I say, the only<br>lang (from mainstream) who<br>support multiple ancestor I know is C++, where it btings many problem in<br>imp[lementation<br>(VTBL offest, moved 'this' accross method calls, multiple method bodies<br>across classes, ...)<br><br><br><br>&gt;3) a) they are my base objects, so Iam the author, and I dont do that<br>&gt;(well not very option)<br>&gt;b) Unless the rotation method is really stupidly doen, you can just<br>&gt;override it<br>Sure, I can override, but if someone extend MY class - it could count<br>with ORIGINAL 'rotation'.<br>This is really common problem, and if you know a bit C# versioning, you<br>can check how deep<br>this problemis in real projects. I don't know other lang than C# who<br>solves this problem<br>generally. And I agree - (a) is not a option.<br><br><br><br>&gt;4) Dont know. I wouldnt know how to do that in any languge.<br>&gt;But my understanding is that its the interface of the object that<br>&gt;is inportant, and that has no relation to inheriting or not. Its<br>&gt;surly, (If a problem at all), a problem about compilation<br>There is a implementation layer problem. Generally only byte-code and<br>interpreted langs<br>could solve the problem. In C/C++/... and other 'compiled' languages you<br>are strating<br>having troubles with field aligemnt, method offsets, etc. (I mean 'real'<br>ones).<br><br><br><br>&gt;5) I have no idea what hes trying to say? If an object needed 10<br>&gt;colours, it needs 10 colours. (I think this was an argumnet used<br>&gt;against useing types at all, rather than an argument against &gt;inheriting)<br>I want to say, that any 'ancestor' or 'other' objects could assume I am<br>working with<br>field 'Color' - but I am not using it. I have 'Colors[10]' array. So, I<br>have to<br>use 'Color' and 'Color[9]' which complicates code a bit (note: this is<br>from real projects,<br>where because of deriving was ppl forced to create various 'stubs' just<br>to make other<br>classea around happy with presumtions).<br><br><br><br>&gt;6) Errr and, thats not an arugument against you useing inhereting, is<br>againt<br>&gt;letting anyone else inhereting your stuff.<br>That's a BIG argument. As author of some 'stuff' I need control usage of it.<br>Many problems are caused by non-planned features/behaviours, which are not<br>initially planned. If other starts using them as 'features' - you have<br>to accept it<br>or break the system. Deriving don't give you control about methods -<br>that they will<br>be called as YOU expect. Eg. if I will do method, which is allowed to<br>derive, but<br>you define, user have to call base one, you have *NO* control, it will<br>work that way. So, it is not forcing ppl to use only for things you<br>designed system for, but force them to use WAY yuo expected/design.<br><br><br><br>&gt;7) Is that about "Unions" cos it is totaly irrelivent to inhereting.<br>&gt;?Again<br>&gt;I think that was an argument against types full stop.<br>This is. Inheriting typically says facts about speed, usability etc. It<br>holds only<br>if you share variables. As I say, many OOP programmer (generally) don't<br>use sharing<br>variables (for that reasons). It's again about control. You can assume,<br>that some<br>varaible is CONSTANT during some algorihm. If you call user<br>event/callback somewhere<br>inside, variable may be changed. our algo can goes to hell. Sure - you<br>don't need<br>to share variables and use 'methods' - where you HAVE control over own<br>internal state,<br>but then you loose one of most nicest thing on deriving - speed &amp;<br>simplicty. With sharing<br>methods only, you are more near compoennt based programming.<br><br><br><br>There are several way, which way one can write code. There are many<br>articles about OOP, COP,<br>procedural etc. I don't know any mainstream lang, which implements OOP<br>(generally) way, I would<br>like &amp; use (and company here). In most cases, well written procedural<br>programming could be<br>faster, better &amp; more ready for futre than typical OOP.<br><br><br>With OOP you have no control over your own usage. If tenths various ppl<br>uses your classes,<br>you need to have control. Not about 'where' and 'for' they use you, but<br>if they use you<br>as YOU EXPECT. THat's why where are many things like COM, COM+, DCOM,<br>CORBA and many many<br>other system, which are mainly about deffinig COMUNICATION - rules. Not<br>just giving your<br>own internal state into hands of others.<br><br><br>I saw too much projects in state, where no-one was really abble to<br>change some of base<br>classes. Because if you will do that - other will stop work.<br><br><br>And yes, I am "typical OOP" sceptic and I don't like it :) As someone,<br>who talk with CS_TBL<br>about these things, I tried to explain him another ways how to work. I<br>fyou are intereating,<br>you could take a look at some other ppl with similar meanign like me.<br></i><br><br><br>Personal note: he tries to do so since 1999 orso, I just mess around with code like Dory swims ...

But again, I feel Im defending inhereting, and your<br>&gt;attacking deriving.<br>Basically yes. OOP is 'geneal' term, and it was used by me and CS in<br>'deriving' context. I think it is most used (or most seen meaning).<br>Generally, OOP could be reprezsnted by:<br><br><br>- procedural programming<br>- asm<br>- inheriting and tree of classes<br>- components<br>....<br><br><br>Many other things. Sure, orthodox "OOP" ppl will completely disagree<br>here (talking about security/encasing of members, ...). But generally<br>OOP could mean anything. Its' (at my opinion) way of coding, rather some<br>concrete language/syntax/...<br><br><br>I hate deriving. On the other side, I approve some other OOP ways. On<br>the other side - I prefer procedural OOP rather pure deriving &amp; tree of<br>classes.<br><br><br>&gt;b) I agree, we do need multiple inhereting<br>Never say this ahead of orthodox OOP ppl :) They could kill you for<br>that. Multiple inheriting brings many many implementation problems. If<br>you know a bit C++ compilers (generated code, how it works), you know,<br>how complicated are 'virtual' members, virtual ancestor (versus<br>non-virtual ones). You could check typical C++ streams - ios etc. Their<br>implementation (from deriving POV) really SUX. And generated code is<br>also much more complicated, than using 'standard' ancestor - these<br>thigns need to use "virtual ancestor" (this is C++ terminology, but it<br>means, there is "more" ways how to derive)<br><br><br><br>&gt;c) Here is were we diverge as to what we are as programmers. Im a lone<br>&gt;programmer. No one but me as access to my types. (You maybe right in a<br>&gt;big organisation)<br>Sure. What is good for one, doesn't need to be good for others. But... I<br>personally think, that even for one, another ways of doing "OOP" could<br>save many lines of code -&gt; time.<br><br><br><br>&gt;d) Again, cannot see relevence to problem.<br>You will feel the problem, when your system will support 3D and you will<br>have to do millions operations per seconds. Until you have just hundreds<br>sprites on screen, you don't feel difference. When you will start doing<br>transformations, ... in more complicated scene, you may start feel how<br>things are implemented. I wanted to say, that at certain point you are<br>starting feel with "compiler" (interpreter...). There are thing, which<br>can't be processed simpler/easier.<br><br><br><br>&gt;e) Ahh, this is the same as the second codebox, simply dont inheret in<br>&gt;this situation. This tho is not a problem with inhereting, just an<br>&gt;indicator that you should derive<br>If I will not inherit, I can't use other things. And it sux. While you<br>inherit, you can't "select" what you wish to inherit, what to inherit<br>but process by yourself (but let ancestor freely use), etc. And it is<br>the point. You are pretty limited. You have no control/selection. That's<br>why nearly every 'deriving' based system tracks many unneeded things. Or<br>because you don't need 1 feature, you will not derive and lost 10 other ?<br><br><br>&gt;f) Ok I see your point. But its a point for a stronger keyword "Final"<br>&gt;than against inhereting<br>Not really. Final doesnt' help. Try to think about few "use cases". And<br>if you started using 'final' - you break inheriting principles. With<br>inheriting - you could use final everywhere then :) No really, really<br>few langs could solve this issue, even not using inheriting. With<br>inheriting, this issue just raise 10x more.<br><br><br>&gt;g) Ahh, yes ok is see what you mean. But isnt that a problem in any<br>&gt;language that allows me to pass a pointer to the variable? (Or to the<br>&gt;type)<br>You don't need pointer to raise that problem. But allowing 'remember'<br>instance (store pointer) also raise this problem. Like previous - with<br>inheritance this issue is 10x raised. Nevertheless, many of inheriting<br>troubles could be found in other langs - even they don't have inheriting<br>by itselfs.<br><br><br>&gt;If this was a disscussion about to use object or not, then I would<br>&gt;hardly mention inhereting at all. It isnt about that. Its a, "If you<br>&gt;are useing OOP", should you use inhereting<br>As I explained, I used OOP in most used term - inheriting. When OOP was<br>"discovered", one of most propagated advantages *IS* inheriting. Check<br>any book for Java, C#, C++, ... any OOP-like lang (I used like, because<br>none of these lang is *really* OOP in right word of meaning) promote<br>inheriting. One of "most used" features. So, that's why me (and also<br>many others) use OOP very often as synonym for inheriting.<br><br><br><br>&gt;Whislt your points might be hard to rebuke in the first argument, they<br>&gt;are not relevent if you do concider that is a disscuion for "after" you<br>&gt;have desided to oop.<br>What I discussed with CS wan't "procedural OOP" but "component based<br>programming" - which is pretty different in designing/thinking from<br>inheriting-OOP. There is not much languages, which creates good<br>enviroment for COP. There are few things, like COM/COM+/DCOM, which are<br>hacked "C" basically. Few better (CORBA, ...) but none really COP. It's<br>like saying C++ (or Blitz) to be real OOP. Both langs are far from being<br>OOP. If so, you will end up in languages like LIST<br></i><br><br><br>and<br><br><i><br>&gt;Could you elaborate on that?

And still you will end up in<br>global/static instances, because you have just 1 CPU, etc.<br><br><br>My personal view on OOP (deriving based) is very similar to ppl, which<br>wrote articles I posted somewhere above. There are many common "lies"<br>regarding OOP.<br><br><br>I am personally into clean component worlds. Components is not component<br>in view of class (eg. TComponent in Delphi and similar enviroments), but<br>it defines something, what could internally contain anything (you don't<br>care) and you communicate throw known interfaces. It it not just list of<br>methods, like interface in most component OOP (COM, java, C#...). It<br>much more. It setup of rules, when/what/who/how. Mapping of methods and<br>objects is 'internal' thing of given component, and you have no way how<br>to review that. You don't need to.<br><br><br>Components allow mass code-reusing, without poke along history rock. You<br>can easily implement caching/streams (somewhere above I posted small<br>use-case). Many ppl call that aspect oriented programming<br>(http://aosd.net) but this is just a small part of it.<br><br><br>Also, I don't see objects as 'this' instance. I see objects as tree<br>structure itself (you could have 3 'this').<br><br><br>There are many things I see different from many other ppl. It's another<br>story, and if we want to seriously discuss that, it could be very long<br>thread.<br><br><br>To be open, there is not yet any language, which fit all me needs.<br>That's one of reasons I wrote 'hack' for C++, which creates something<br>like COM+, but pretty different way. But still it's far from ideal<br>state. So, in the way, I started in free time doing own small project,<br>which can prove or destroy what I am saying. Many ppl I have talekd<br>about that goes with me, because these problem I am talking about are<br>pretty common.<br><br><br>So, there is really many things I see differently, nut just deriving.<br>But deriving it 'top pissed feature' in OOP I think. I there will be<br>some vote about "Worst OOP programming way", I will put my 10 cents for<br>deriving, as it is implemented in most languages (delphi, blitz, c#,<br>java....).<br></i> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Like<br>- OOP tends to have history rock problems - like:<br><br><br>1. member names (adding later on childs/parents/...)<br>2. impossibility to change anything, coz you risc system failuring<br>3. redundant members, which are used in SOME 'childs' and ancestor CAN<br>work this them<br>...<br><br><br>So, instead of trying to minimize this problem (on lang/design layer),<br>MS (and others) found solution: HUGE versioning system, which could<br>solve all these illness. But it doesn't mean, you have better system.<br>You just have way, how to cut down impact of that.<br><br><br>Similar to other things.<br><br><br>Sure, you can find similar problems in other OOP too, or non-OOP. But in<br>deriving OOP, all problems, we were talking about are biggest ones.<br><br><br>This thread have one small problem: if discussing ppl never meet<br>deriving OOP based project, in size (at least) ~tenths of thousands<br>lines with hundreds classes, they will probably never see these points.<br>At certain point, I belive every1 will see.<br><br><br>I guess you know refactoring. It's another 'nice' thing, how to make<br>results "better" while keeping system bad :) Refactoring could also<br>repair many things, but it just minimizes fallenness... It doesn't cure.<br><br><br>Like CS. Until he wrote code (1 file) up to 5K lines, he was "lazy" to<br>do many things, which you should expect to be in code. At certain point,<br>he found, that it's not possible to remember everything. He wishes to<br>reuse some portions of code... He found, simulating 'instances' throw<br>array wasn't soo clever as it looks in the beginning :) That's why he<br>stared this thread.<br><br><br>But before ? He would never belive you or me :)<br><br><br>Or me, when I was starting programming (asm @ C64 - nice machine :) I<br>was same like he was. It was long time ago..<br><br><br>At certain point I changed my mind. And srated writing code to be<br>'readable' - I found my brain is to weak to remember all in ASM files,<br>which had 20.000 lines... Same happends later with deriving based OOP. I<br>love it :) Really. Until first big project grows, grows, more and more<br>ppl have to work, ... Even I was 'more open' at that time already, as<br>far as we reach point of no return, I have preferred deriving based OOP.<br>It becomes slowly.... It happens -8 years ago if I remember well.<br><br><br>So, that's why these kind of threads are long and both sides need to<br>have mind open to "different" things - if not, we will cycle around few<br>points, like happen here.<br></i><br><br>------------------- -------------------<br>Note: the instances in an array is long ago, pre-Blitzplus even. The problem I have is that I'm usually the user of my own tools, so because of creative reasons I tend to rush things in order to be able to use it yesterday. And since those tools are unique in some way, I can't use alternatives. Since B+ I hid my stuff privately in banks, and since BMax I hide them in types. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This would be more work, and to be honest I again wont do it. If a want a variable structue with one more variable than a structure I already have, then I am definatly either extending the first structure or "field"ing it.<br><br>One Giant calss with redundent variables, capible of being all my variable structures? Well thats spectrum basic, in reality no types at all.<br><br>I apprechiate all your strong opinions about the problems of oop, and extending in particular, but I think you are simply highlighting pitfalls that can then be avoided, as apposed to showing an unpassable chasim in the road.<br><br>I also think that there are alternative solutions to programing that dont require oop, but to say that because oop isnt perfect you shoudnt use it, is illadvised.<br><br>On the westen/easten medicine thing, the west has always tried to fix the body, whilst the east has always tried to keep the body from needing fixing. In the end a best system would include them both? (Bear in mind I have not been saying you "should" inheret all the time, yet you have been saying you should never, and you see that the analogy supports my stance)<br><br>Have a go at the retoric if you want, but the question is what needs anwsering.
