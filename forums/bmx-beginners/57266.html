However, if I put this command right before I create the image I am rotating, it rotates from the centre (which is what I'm after). Now - according to the docs - <br>'When auto midhandle mode is enabled, all images are automatically 'midhandled' (see MidHandleImage) when they are created. If auto midhandle mode is disabled, images are handled by their top left corner.'<br><br>So surely if I set this at the start of my code ALL images thereafter should be handled from the middle?<br>Thanks <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It does this WHEN you load or create any new ones.<br><br>The reason for this is that the TImage Type has HandleX# and HandleY# properties (they might be called something slightly different) that keep a record of the handle to use when it comes to drawing them.  By default, this is set to 0,0, unless you have AutoMidHandle enabled, in which case, it will become the centre of the image.<br><br>For the behaviour you were expecting, it would either have to go through all your images and reset the handle (not a good idea) or over-ride any handle settings when it comes to drawing your images.  But why would you change it for any image once it has been created?  Surely you'd want the handle to remain in the same place.  However, if you do want to change it, there are other commands that handle image handles.<br><br>I think you just misunderstood the docs, as the clue to its action is there...<br><br>'When auto midhandle mode is enabled, all images are automatically 'midhandled' (see MidHandleImage) <b>when they are created</b>. If auto midhandle mode is disabled, images are handled by their top left corner.'<br><br>Anyway, just a little explanation there.
