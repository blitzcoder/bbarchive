First impresions count and I`m sure that I`m not the only one who wishes that something so simple could be given a few hours to sort out properly.<br><br>BMax is a great program and I really enjoy using it but for other beginners like me it is a lot harder to learn than I think it needs to be.<br><br>Please sort this out BRL or pay one of the many talented people on this forum to update the docs so that they reflect the true quality of Bmax.<br><br>Jason. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

As well until recently there has been hotdocs, a documentating system that was especially powerfull when you wanted to program on OO level as it documented everything not only the "officially" documented features (the rest is not meant to be used by 0815 users) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
