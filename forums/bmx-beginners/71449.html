A 8MB zip file to download and a program that installs and takes up 20MB  of disk space.  Or a 11MB zip file to download and installs and takes up  13MB of disk?  The downloaded file is on your hard disk for a very short time, the uncompressed may be there for a long time.  Takes this a step further to a large game with many MB's of graphics.
