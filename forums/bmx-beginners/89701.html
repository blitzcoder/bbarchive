I am currently working on an "RPG Maker" type program, and I am still in the planning stage.  Here is what I have so far (pseudo-code):<br>(the entries in the arrays would be repeated based on how many objects were specified by the user)<br><pre class=code>
gObject Array[ object( can a be tile, the player character, an NPC, an enemy, etc.) ]

Rem
create a hash table from the gObject Array beforehand( making sure that there are NO duplicate
entries), store it, and "map" it to the other arrays (i.e. object at position [5] in the array (starting
from 0, so the 6th) will reference the "data holder" array starting at position [35] for it's data, so
that the object need not be re-referenced( for specific values) within a loop or otherwise, with
the object's x and y values only needed to be "read" once( maybe from
a loading screen--however short) from the object and stored in the array for future
checks/calculations, being referenced by array position in the future instead of using object
methods

a gObject would store images and other things
EndRem




String Array[ switch( can be "on" or "off" (will skip ahead to next switch if "off")), type of
condition, number of arguments( depends on condition type), arguments ]

Rem
use a Select...Case block with each Case being a different type of condition, passing values
using the "number of arguments" from the appropriate array index

also, depending on the type of condition (i.e. whether it takes place before the game really
starts), the conditions should be added into the String Array by the editor according to
importance
EndRem




String Array[ variable name, value of variable ]

Rem
create a hash table of all of the variable names beforehand( so that they can be set up and
referenced appropriately) but do not provide for dynamic creation of variables for
now (unfortunately, this does not seem to be something I can circumvent)
EndRem




Int Array[ object type, x position, y position, image handle, drawing layer, degrees of rotation ]

Rem
so, 6 parameters per object for the "data holder" array

when an object is deleted from the gObject Array, you must update the "data holder" array
EndRem
</pre><br><br>Eventually I just want to have all this stored as XML, and just read it back as "opening" a "project file" in the RPG-Maker-clone editor( <i>if you haven't used it then, well, let me say that the user specifies almost <b>everything</b> beforehand, then compiles it into an unchanging 'game' (you can see it's help file <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/23263415/rpg2003-hlp-converted-to-PDF" target="_blank">here</a>)</i>), and I would just build everything off of that.<br><br>Would I just make different Functions for all of the different types of my game, and, depending on the 'conditional type', feed them values from the 'conditional' string array?

That should work well for using the same variable more than once, but if you're only using it once in an equation (or passing it off) you needn't do that. Also, you'll run into issues if you want to pass that 'variable' off to another function to (potentially) make changes to it.. in that case you would either have to pass the object or a pointer to the object's value. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
