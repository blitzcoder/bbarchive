Please tell me you don't think that documentation is an optional luxury for a programming language.

I really got the buzz for coding again (especially after I left my day job and didnt have to code to keep a roof over my head) and spent many an all nighter coding until dawn. Now I've moved over onto a Mac as my primary platform I was rather hoping for many more such nights with Bmax but sadly, as yet, it's not quite there. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
