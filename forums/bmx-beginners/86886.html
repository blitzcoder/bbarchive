There is always something we don't like about every thing. There are things we wish it had and there are things it has and don't even know how to use. Ultimately one person puts a product on the table for sale to make a living and it's up to us to decide whether it's good for us or not. Best we can do is suggest to the author/seller what we think it should have, be removed, or fixed about the product. if he/she cares or is smart enough the changes will be made, if they are worth the effort. If he/she doesn't, he/shell'll come around when everybody start going for the competition. Simple law of supply and demand. you can't fight that. just go with the flow. <br><br>Tantrums are just childish attempts at getting attention.

The earlier versions of Blitzbasic were more like BASIC, but as the language evolved over the years, it became more like a modern language that just didn't follow C-style syntax. The reason why Strict is non-standard, was to improve compatability with code produced in earlier versions of Blitz in which there was no such thing. Nowadays I agree it should be default, but in the first days, I guess it made sense to ease the transition.<br><br>As for the "stupid shortcuts", I didn't even know about $ etc for long while :P (I knew they were in earlier Blitz but I thought they were superceded by :Int, :String.. if you don't like them, you don't have to use them :P)<br><br>About the fact there lacks an unsigned int or long (or signed byte or short).. this too bugged me, but after a while, I realised it's not really that big a deal!
