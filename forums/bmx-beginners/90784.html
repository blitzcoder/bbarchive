My last project was done entirely in one source file, and was generally unorganized.  Being my first real project it was pieced together as I thought of things and made to work piece-by-piece, rather than outlining the project and writing abstract code that could handle my tasks, only to later be dressed up by specifics to the game. <br><br>It was a huge pain having to do a "Find" string constantly when I wanted to edit a block of code in a huge source file.  I was wondering: how does one use things like header files in BlitzMax IDE properly (including them, what goes in them, etc.) and in general how do you split your code up to make it more manageable?  I would really like to make this project as organized and lucid as possible, and I think having header files, source files, etc. will aid in this.<br><br>-muffins <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The code tree in maxIDE is enough for me to quickly move around. It depends on the amount of lines and/or the structure of your code and/or the amount of types. In my case I had around 4 large types and nothing more worth mentioning. These types are around 600-1000 lines each, so that's already rather big<br><br>But if you really want to split up your code, then I'd make a file per type, including <i>related</i> things like globals, instance create functions, user event definitions etc.) I would also make an include file for global functions.<br><br>You could at least try it, but in a way there's little difference between clicking a type in the code tree and clicking a file tab. An advantage of tabs is that you can keep the focus on a certain line in tabs while working in another tab, but I'm not sure how often this situation happens.. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

For me, this method of organization splits the file up into chunks that make sense to me.  While it may not be a huge time-saver, it helps me organize it this way so that I can quickly get to a type, function, variable, or main loop which are the 4 big things in this project.  Your method of organization breaks these files down further and sorts them by their relevance (graphics, logic, maths, file op, etc.), so I will probably adopt that scheme.  However, it is broken down further than what I have, and I still can't even get this method of organization to work :[ <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
