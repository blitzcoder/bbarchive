&lt;h1&gt;Arrays&lt;/h1&gt;

Arrays are used to store sequences of variables, or 'elements'. An element within an array is accessed by 'indexing' the array with an integer offset.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The general syntax for indexing an array is:
&lt;div class=syntax&gt;
&lt;font class=syntax&gt;Array&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font class=token&gt;[&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font class=syntax&gt;Index1,Index2 etc...&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font class=token&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Creating Arrays&lt;/h2&gt;
The most common way to create an array is when declaring a variable:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre class=demo&gt;
Local int_array[10]
&lt;/pre&gt;
This will initialize the &lt;font class=ident&gt;int_array&lt;/font&gt; variable with a 10 element array. You can declare an 'empty' array by using &lt;font class=token&gt;[]&lt;/font&gt;:
&lt;pre class=demo&gt;
Local int_array[]
&lt;/pre&gt;
An empty array is identical to an array with 0 elements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Something to remember about arrays is that they are zero based, that is, the first element of the array has an index of 0.
So if you declare an array with 4 elements, they will be indexed from 0 to 3.
&lt;pre class="demo"&gt;
Local int_array[4] 'Create an array with 4 elements (the default type for the array will be &lt;a href="datatypes.html"&gt;Int&lt;/a&gt;)

int_array[0] = 1 'put the number 1 in the first element of the array.
int_array[1] = 2 'put the number 2 in the second element of the array.
int_array[2] = 3 'put the number 3 in the third element of the array.
int_array[3] = 4 'put the number 4 in the fourth element of the array.

print int_array[0] 'print the first element
print int_array[3] 'print the fourth element
&lt;/pre&gt;

Arrays may also be created 'on the fly' using the syntax:
&lt;div class=syntax&gt;
&lt;font class=token&gt;New&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font class=syntax&gt;ElementType&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font class=token&gt;[&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font class=syntax&gt;Dimension1,Dimension2 etc...&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font class=token&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
This returns an array of the specified dimension(s) with each element initialized to &lt;font class=token&gt;Null&lt;/font&gt;. For example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre class=demo&gt;
Local int_array:Int[]
int_array=New Int[10]
&lt;/pre&gt;
'Auto arrays' may be created using the syntax (an Auto Array is simply an array with predefined values in each index)&lt;br&gt;:
&lt;div class=syntax&gt;
&lt;font class=token&gt;[&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font class=syntax&gt;Element1,Element2 etc...&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font class=token&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
This returns a 1 dimensional array containing the specified elements, for example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre class=demo&gt;
Local int_array[]=[1,2,3,4,5]
&lt;/pre&gt;
Each element of an auto array must have exactly the same type. If necessary, you can use type conversions to enforce this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Arrays provide a &lt;font class=token&gt;Sort&lt;/font&gt; method and a read only &lt;font class=token&gt;length&lt;/font&gt; field. &lt;font class=token&gt;Sort&lt;/font&gt; takes an optional &lt;b&gt;ascending&lt;/b&gt; parameter that defaults to true. Here is an example of sorting an array:
&lt;pre class=code&gt;Strict
Local arr:String[]=["some","random","strings","in","a","string","array"]
arr.Sort        'sort ascending
Print "Array in ascending order..."
For Local t:String=EachIn arr
        Print t
Next
arr.Sort False  'sort descending
Print "Array in descending order..."
For Local t:String=EachIn arr
        Print t
Next&lt;/pre&gt;
To copy or resize an array, use a &lt;a href=slices.html&gt;slice&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Example of resizing an array using slices:
&lt;pre class="code"&gt;
Local myArray[10] 'create an array with 10 elements (0..9)
myArray = myArray[..20] 'increase number of elements in the array to 20
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Multi-Dimensional Arrays&lt;/h2&gt;
To create an array with more than dimension, you can specify indexes seperated by commas:
&lt;pre class="code"&gt;
Local int_array1 : Int[4,4] 'create a 4x4 array
Local int_array2 : Int[3,3,3] 'create a 3x3x3 array
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can then refer to them like so:
&lt;pre class="code"&gt;
int_array1[0,0] = 100
int_array2[2,1,0] = 1000
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Multi-Dimensional Auto Arrays&lt;/h3&gt;
This is a slightly more advanced topic and as such, beginners may at first find it confusing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It is not currently possible to create normal Mult-Dimensional Arrays AND auto-initialize them.  You can however cheat a little:
&lt;pre class="code"&gt;
Local string_array:String[][] = [["Bob","Kate","Percy"],["Cecil","Edmund","Elizabeth"]] 

Print string_array[0][2] 'this will print Percy
Print string_array[1][0] 'this will print Cecil
&lt;/pre&gt;
What the above actually does is create an &lt;font class=token&gt;Array&lt;/font&gt; of type &lt;font class=token&gt;Int Array&lt;/font&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
If you were to attempt to refer to it in the conventional manner it would cause an error (Incorrect number of array dimensions).
&lt;pre class="code"&gt;
Local string_array:String[][] = [["Bob","Kate","Percy"],["Cecil","Edmund","Elizabeth"]] 
Print string_array[0,0] 'this line would cause an error
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;BASIC Compatibility&lt;/h1&gt;

This section covers some of the differences between BlitzMax and 'classic' BASIC, and introduces features that help overcome some of classic BASIC's shortcomings.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Strict mode&lt;/h2&gt;
Classic BASIC allows you to declare variables 'on the fly'. For example, consider a program consisting of:
&lt;pre class="code"&gt;
For k=1 To 10
	sum=sum+k
Next
Print sum
&lt;/pre&gt;
This program automatically creates 2 local variables: 'k' and 'sum'. However, this behaviour can often lead to unexpected bugs. For example, if you mistyped one of the 'sum' variables, the program would not work as expected. No error would be given - a new variable would simply be created.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
By default, BlitzMax will allow you to automatically declare variables like this. However, you can use the &lt;font class=token&gt;Strict&lt;/font&gt; command to override this behaviour.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font class=token&gt;Strict&lt;/font&gt; must appear at the top of your program before any actual program code and puts your program into 'strict mode'. 
Strict mode forces you to declare all variables before use. For example, rewriting the above program in strict mode results in:
&lt;pre class="code"&gt;
Strict
Local sum,k
For k=1 To 10
	sum=sum+k
Next
Print sum
&lt;/pre&gt;
If you were to mistype one of the variable names in this program, you would receive an 'identifier not found' error when compiling, allowing you to easily find and correct the problem.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Arrays&lt;/h2&gt;

Blitzmax does not support the Dim statement for array creation. Instead, arrays in BlitzMax are real types - they can be passed to functions, returned from functions and placed in variables.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To create a classic BASIC style array in BlitzMax, use a global variable. For example:

&lt;pre class="code"&gt;Global my_array$[100]	'create a 100 element string array&lt;/pre&gt;

Also note that arrays in BlitzMax are not '1 bigger' than their dimensioned size - the 100 element array above contains 100 elements, numbered 0 through 99 inclusive.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
BlitzMax also does not support a 'Redim' operation. Instead, you can use &lt;a href=slices.html&gt;slices&lt;/a&gt;. For example:

&lt;pre class="code"&gt;Global my_array$[100]		'create a 100 element string array
my_array=my_array[..200]	'now a 200 element array!&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Goto and Gosub&lt;/h2&gt;

BlitzMax does not support the Gosub command. Use &lt;a href=functions.html&gt;functions&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The Goto command is supported, but only in non-strict mode. Goto labels should be prefixed with a &lt;font class=token&gt;#&lt;/font&gt; character. For example:
&lt;pre class=code&gt;For k=1 To 10
	a=Rand(10)
	If a&lt;5 Then Goto LessThan5 
	If a&gt;5 Then Goto GreaterThan5
	Print "a is equal to 5"
	Goto AllDone
#LessThan5
	Print "a is less than 5"
	Goto AllDone
#GreaterThan5
	Print "a is greater than 5"
#AllDone
Next&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Data, Read and Restore&lt;/h2&gt;

Data, Read and Restore are supported but have been renamed to &lt;font class=token&gt;DefData&lt;/font&gt;, &lt;font class=token&gt;ReadData&lt;/font&gt; and &lt;font class=token&gt;RestoreData&lt;/font&gt;. Data labels must also be prefixed with a &lt;font class=token&gt;#&lt;/font&gt; character.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Object handles&lt;/h2&gt;

BlitzMax allows objects to be assigned to integer variables, and integer variables to be passed to functions expecting objects. This is mainly for the benefit of beginners, as it reduces the size and complexity of code, but is also great for lazy pro's! For example:
&lt;pre class=code&gt;Graphics 640,480
image=LoadImage( "an_image.png" ) 'returned object is converted to an integer handle
DrawImage image,0,0               'integer image parameter is converted back to an object
Flip
WaitKey&lt;/pre&gt;
This is achieved using an &lt;i&gt;object handle&lt;/i&gt; system, and such handles should be released using the &lt;font class=token&gt;Release&lt;/font&gt; command when they are no longer needed. For example:
&lt;pre class=code&gt;Graphics 640,480
image=LoadImage( "an_image.png" ) 'returned object is converted to an integer handle
DrawImage image,0,0               'integer image parameter is converted back to an object
Release image                     'image no longer needed - release it
Flip
WaitKey&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Failing to release an object handle will result in memory leaks. However, all objects are released at program exit anyway, so for quick 'n' dirty jobs you don't have to bother.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Type tag shortcuts&lt;/h2&gt;

When declaring variables and function return types, BlitzMax allows you to use BASIC style 'type tags'. These are as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Shortcut&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Equivalent type&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font class=token&gt;%&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font class=token&gt;Int&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font class=token&gt;#&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font class=token&gt;Float&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font class=token&gt;!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font class=token&gt;Double&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font class=token&gt;$&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font class=token&gt;String&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
For example, a string variable can be declared in two ways:
&lt;pre class="code"&gt;
Local a_string:String
Local another_string$
&lt;/pre&gt;
Mac users whose keyboards do not feature the # character should use 'Alt 3'.

&lt;/body&gt;

Then, add a page for each function, and add it to your module's category ('[[Category:MyAStarModule]]'). You should just name the pages the same thing you name the functions. Unless you think that it could interfere with another article later on, you don't even need a suffix, etc. If you decide you do, just use your module's name (e.g. "AStarFunction (MyAStarModule)"). As for upload a zip file containing the module, I'm getting uploads enabled, so you can just upload it and place a link on your module's category page. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

For instance, here's what bmax properties would probably look something like:<br><br><pre class=code>Type TImage

 Private Field _width,_height'Errors atm

 Property Width

  Method Get()
   Return _width 
  EndMethod

  Method Set(value)
   ?debug
    Print "width set to "+value
   ?
   _width=value
  EndMethod

 End Property

EndType</pre><br><br>Then, you do this:<br><br>img.Width=50<br><br>And it'll print the message and set the private variable.  You can also have only the get or only the set defined, so that you can only do that, while having the syntax of a variable.  So, basically it is a variable except that you can change the implementation without breaking stuff.<br><br>This is super low on my list of things that should be in bmax.  Private members in types, and method/function overloading are at the top. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
