I'm pretty much in the same boat, coming from years of C++ and directx it's a breath of fresh air.  I used the demo version to check out a few things before I purchased though.  I would have brought Greys framework had he not withdrawn it, but as a start I wanted to avoid external modules for fear of bloat and instability (with no external mods i'll know the bloat and instability are my fault :) )<br><br>Even so, within a couple of weeks I had;<br><br>[] A really simple gui (buttons/text labels and input text lines)<br>[] Animated sprite handling (using GraphicsGale)<br>[] Scripted 'animators' that can be attached to objects to manipulate their scale/rotation/position &amp; alpha values<br>[] Bitmap font handling using MikeWeirings bmfont code (the only external code I'm using at the moment) and the AngelCode font generator<br>[] An application framework with loading screens, automated flow between modules, scripted resource loading and handling<br>[] a locale handler to exchange strings at runtime for their locale specific versions (works with filenames as well as text strings, so if you draw a texture with english writing on it, it can be swapped at load time for an alternative filename)<br>[] 2d particle effects<br>[] my first game well underway (it's the best way to develop a framework and test code!)<br><br>Basically all the stuff I spent years developing in C++ so I might have a stable base to develop games off.  And, all this will just compile and run for mac and linux?? (I'm prepared for some tweakage if and when i get that far).
