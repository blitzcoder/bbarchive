I think an "ideal" (asin what I think is pleasing), would be everything in a type.<br><pre class=code>Global ReturnValue:Int = 0

Personally I think that's a great approach, since it doesn't force OO on those who don't want it, but allows it for those who like it.<br><br>As for me, I'm big on OOP.  One of my few problems with the otherwise-great Blitz3D was how functions were unrelated to their data, and how there were no static locals (i.e. Globals within a Type in Max), forcing the use of program-wide Globals for what should be limited within a Function.<br><br>BlitzMax fixed all that wonderfully while not <i>requiring</i> OO use.  I'm quite happy with it, and once 3D is added, it should become the greatest language around for those who can appreciate it! (That's perhaps a bit over-the-top, but it's how I feel &lt;g&gt;.)<br><br>So program with whatever amount of objects that you like.  It's your code, and whatever level of objects works best for you, from none to near-total, BMax is ready to provide. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So it's really just a matter of what you feel comfortable with. I really wouldnt bother with questions like 'Is this bad programming?". It all comes down to personal peference really.<br><br>In the end the only thing that matters is that your game gets done and in the most efficient and fast way possible,so you can get the best possible performance out of it. Whether this is achieved through procedural or OOP design, is entirely dependant on the type of program you are creating.<br><br>The only thing you need to watch out for when combining the 2, is that you have a coherent structure to it. Being consistent is the key here, because otherwise you will find yourself in a maze of unfathomable garbage when you read it back in a few weeks. As long as there is a clear structure to your way of doing things, then it really oughta be ok. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
