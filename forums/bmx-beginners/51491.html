</pre><br><br>That's about as straightforward as the graphical text-entry can get.  You need to understand that once you start getting into real-time graphics work, a lot of things that seem trivial aren't necessarily so--but they're not necessarily complex, either.  You just need to customize behavior to your own needs, as there isn't really a good analog for the "Input" function in a graphical realm; there are simply too many factors to consider and too many different ways in which any given programmer might want to implement text input. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I think you need to redefine what you put into the term "programming language". <br><br>To give an example; If you were to ask a couple of progammers what would be the easiest language to start with, chances are that they would tell you Visual Basic. But the thing is this, doing what you are asking (eg accept a number input) in Visual Basic isn't really easier than doing it in BlitzMax. The difference is that if you use Visual Basic you get an editor suite (Visual Studio) that hides a lot of the implementation in Controls. I.e. It's really easy to add a textbox to a widows form that lets you input your number. But if you were to look at the code behind the textbox Control, you'd pretty soon realize that it is far from simple. The difference is that someone has already done the work for you. That's all fine and dandy if you wan't to do it the way that someone at MS thinks you should do it. If you want to do it in another way, I'm sorry to tell you, it gets pretty complex pretty fast.<br><br>BlitzMax does not have a fancy editing suite (I think most users of this forum agree that the IDE is as 'barebone' as it gets). The main reason for this is that the focus of the BlitzMax is creation of games. It is not very likely that two different game devlopers want their textbox to look and act the same. Hence the 'if you want it, build it!' mentality often displayed in these forums.<br><br>The important thing is: You need to separate 'programming languges' from 'programming tools'. On that note I'd say that BlitzMax *is* an entry level programming language but it hasn't got a lot of tools (Actually, if you start looking around the site you'll realize that there actually are a lot of tools, in the form of code archives etc. They are just not as nicely presented as in some other products :) )<br><br>So I guess all you have to do now is decide what you want to do. Do you want to learn how to program? Well then it's time to roll up your sleves. Do you want to assemble applications from prefabricated bits? Then you probably should look at other products than BlitzMax.<br><br>So stop whining and join the fun!<br><br>//PetBom <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

As far as experience goes, it's true that a lot of us are more experienced, but you've gotta practice to get there--we've all put in our time doing stupid little things like making a white ball bounce off the edges of the screen.  We've all done the "Big Bertha" style target game to practise physics.  We've all done the "guess a number" game.<br><br>It's fairly basic to write any of the above examples, but you're still looking at a good number of lines of code to do it--and to be honest, if parsing keyboard input is posing this much of an obstacle to you, you need to set your sights a little lower for the time being.  I'm not saying this to be mean or snide; rather, you're going to set yourself up for a whole lot of frustration unless you start out by tackling very basic, boring, move-stuff-around-the-screen stuff.<br><br>I <i>strongly</i> recommend you pick up a book or two on game making if you haven't already.  I've heard good things about Maneesh Sethi's books (http://http://www.maneeshsethi.com/), though I haven't had a chance to check them out myself.
