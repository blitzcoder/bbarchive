I was excited with the 3 short-and-simple demos, but hey, they were cool, nice fx, and seemed simple to code, powerful, etc. At that time I thought that would be a good purchase...<br><br>I began coding and seeing the 'C++ like' scripts and the 'easily-extendable' (to make your app you must overwrite the 'pseudo-gui' code or expand it... what?? that's what they mean by easily extendable?) ... in general the coding philosophy in T2D is, IMHO, not very well oriented.<br>I'd rather code in plain basic ... it must be a hell making a complex game in T2D (i.e, doing it in a smart way, not just throwing bunchs of lines of code into a script).<br><br>Later I saw Bmax and... here I am, and not even thought I made the wrong decision. What's the importance of having so much 'power' if the language itself is a hell to code, follow, debug, expand, etc?<br>I prefer looking at a code and saying 'this is surely the way it should be done' and having to expand its 'power' by writing libraries, using user mods, etc... than saying 'oh man will this really work?' and crossing my fingers so I'm lucky and can see that hidden 'power'.<br><br>Sorry if I seemed a bit rude, I don't have anything against the company that develops T2D, nor its other products which I haven't tried (and would like to do someday); but T2D was a great disappointment for me :/ I was expecting a lot more of it <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Theres a short tutorial and documentation is quite bland (not that the current BMAX docs are any better). Frankly, after playing with it a while, I got sick of the Torque script implementations and shoved it on the shelf next to my Torque3D.  Perhaps I'm not the big fan of point and click type stuff since its not entirely flexible and I can forsee a lot of "workarounds" to do anything complex with it. <br><br>A couple months later I purchased the PC version of BMAX and have been using it since...... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Bmax's engine and T2D's engine is vastly different.  The scripting syntax is a lot different and more complex than blitzmax's...  The graphics engine is vector based so that the graphics you toss at it can scale for any size screen (which is a big turnoff for me as I like pixel perfect control over what I display), and it uses a totally different coordinate system if I remember right (0,0 being in the middle of the screen).  The networking that torque is famous for has been promised for months now but still isn't in the product...  The "early adopter" release that is currently what you buy is far from finished and it's been quite a while since it was updated last (though it's been a month or so since I've looked...  I basically gave up on it.)<br><br>They are two vastly different products.  The torque networking code was my big draw and we're still waiting for it.

There are limitations that are annoying and cumbersome in T2D such as collision scaling and so forth. What if I wanted the collision area smaller than the object? I would have to make yet another sprite and scale it smaller, attach it and make it invisible. The author doesn't even see this as a problem to be fixed in the scale collision code! Thats just one problem and I am at THEIR mercy.<br><br>Did I mention that C++ takes far longer to code in? Then debugging with the Torque console. Okay you asked for it:<br><br>Torque 2D doesn't even come with an IDE! You have to supply your own. And where is strict? Yep thats right kids, there's no strict so your variables are prone to error. This usually isn't a big problem but read on....<br><br>Say you do make mistakes? these are almost impossible to track down due to having to use the console to check for errors. And often it won't accurately tell you where the error occured. And it'll still run even if a fatal error occurs...<br><br>This is because of Torque Script. In T2D (which is actually pretty hard to modify in C++ ... at least I think so) you don't have a choice. You're limited to using the script pretty much.<br><br>Conclusion:<br>--------------<br>Blitzmax games are roughly twice as fast under most conditions to T2D games, and where pathfinding or other techniques are involved then you will need to use C++ with T2D to create an external command as torque script is interpreted.<br><br>You are forced to use their directory structure, find your own IDE, and work their way through development. If you want to make an editor this involves either using the Torque GUI and script or C++. This is a good and a bad thing. A lot of C++ knowledge is needed.<br><br>Eventually I thought why the @#!* am I doing all this C++ ? what is the POINT of rapid development like Torque if I'm gonna do all the work anyway? SO I moved to popcap.<br><br>Popcap is brilliant, but if you put popcap next to blitzmax, blitzmax actually beats it into submission for 2D games. And that is what popcap's for.

There's no need to keep re-stating <i>"Use what is available now. If Blitz3D isn't good enough, abandon BRL immediately because they're never gonna release Max3D and it's gonna be worse than some of the freely availible engines anyway so just shut up."</i> Now that may seem a little exaggerated, but it's the general impression I feel Evak is being given.<br><br>BlitzMax is a very good language and I believe it will become a extremely good development tool, partly because of it's speed, power, and expandibility, and partly because of the great syntax.

I think it can become excellent over time with the addition of 3D and GUI modules, plus some better high-level tools.<br><br>I do think there is an important place for make it `easier` to create games or whatever kind of software, especially if that means having to do less programming or low-level stuff of any kind. Whether it be map editors or graphics tools or game designers or whatever, I think those can and do help a lot for a number of people and its an area that should be branched into for BlitzMax to really complete the picture.<br><br>I think the language itself is very good and overall easy to use. I wouldn't want to have to program anything in C or C++ and have avoided ever learning anything about those. They are very mainstream, plain and ordinary, in my opinion, and BlitzMax is much more suitable for making games in particular. I don't think a C++ based system can compare to a system like BlitzMax where the language is crafted specifically to make it easier to make games. There's a lot of difference there and it's an important one.<br><br>I do think there's some features `missing` or that would in general help a lot of people, be it 3d, gui, reading pixels, palette options, more sound or music support, whatever.. but I am sure these WILL come eventually. But in spite of those things it's already very good and I think it can really shine once there are more Max-specific applications/helpers/utilities are released. At the moment people are focussing on adding functionality, 3d engines, etc, but once you have that, you will then need a really good 3d map editor, a cool audio package, great new IDE's, etc... these higher level things which make our whole development process that much more enjoyable and less drudgery.<br><br>Those are the areas that I'm focussing on right now, personally - the higher-level tools, finding ways of automating more of the monotonous aspects of creating stuff, and using the computer as a helpful assistant rather than just as a passive recipient of key presses.<br><br>So I guess Torque has some things going for it if it has map editing and that kind of stuff, but C++ - a definite no no. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Now I'm taking it very seriously, and am ready to make my first game.  I've bought DBPRo (I hated it, honestly I did) and bought BMax.  BMax is awesome and I'm learning its functionality very fast.<br><br>Because I am lacking in physics and other forms of advanced mathematics Torque2D seemed appealing to me.  Anyone who is in my position wants to have the most creative freedom possibile in game creation, and they want it EASY as possible too.  Althouhg Torque2D would make soem things easier I have decided to pick BlitzMax because I do not want to have to STOP and learn C++ in the middle of programming when something doesn't work they way *I* want it to.<br><br>BliotzMax (er BlitzMax) may not be done yet (thats cool with me) but atleast its easy to use and I dont need additional software knowhow to use it (C++, etc)<br><br>So yeah, I'll take BMax thank you very much!!  I appreciate all feedback. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Back in the good old days, you couldn't stop Mark from talking about all the wonderful and cool ideas he had for Blitz. It was like listening to a very smart child explain why christmas is awesome.
