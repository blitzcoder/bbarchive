I noticed your other thread about programmers vs artists and I somewhat comiserate with you. I don't think that people saying you are whining is very compassionate and you have every right to be frustrated. Given that you spent a lot of time working with a very simlar but different product - Blitz3D - it's not really any surprise that you are having troubles transitioning. You no doubt have built up habits that are difficult to undo and part of you is probably thinking you're still programming in Blitz3D, only to find that something changes. I'm sure that can be pretty confusing.<br><br>For me, having been out of coding entirely for 4 years, and having only used Blitz Basic 2 minimally in the past (did mostly 68k coding), it hasn't been quite so difficult for me to pick it up. There are some new concepts that take a little  bit of learning but it's certainly doable once you get used to it.  I think you probably have to `unlearn` some of what you learned and have more patience with it.  You have every right to want to give up if that's what you choose, but I don't think BlitzMax is inherantly wrong or bad, you are just having a personal problem with transitioning from what you're used to in your personal history. I think that BlitzMax overall is good.<br><br>So anyway, there you go. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I've learnt enough in a week to make a simple game, and I can see how powerfull it is, but its a pain in the arse to learn anything as there is no documentation for beginners.<br><br>Almost everything I've learnt came through tutorials for other BRL products, unfortunately not being able to post in other forums that have topics that re more relevant to beginners makes things harder than they need to be.<br><br>It's only been through a huge effort and a little help from Antony and Waves recent tutorials that I have gotten anywhere at all as far as learning more Bmax specific areas of coding.<br><br>Some things are definately harder, and others missing entirely, so you can't allways follow basic tutorials easily, even simple tutorials about input, and printing input on screen is a chore as commands like Getkey and equivalent simply don't exist.<br><br>Bit odd that I learnt most of my Bmax skills from Blitzcoder, as currently thats the only place that allows discussion across languages, and easy access to information suitable for beginners. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I had forgotten even the most basic things. declaring variables, functions and types were completely alien to me initialy, and without simple knowledge like this I had to rely on Krylars beginner articles for Blitz2D to understand the basics of Bmax. <br><br>It took me a while to figure out how Blitzmax knew what X and Y were, even though I could see it was working I found the whole thing pretty confusing, and I obviously still didn't quite get variables and how they worked with commands, despite the fact that I had been using them in working code.<br><br>Anyway, I finally got it a few days ago, and am finding it a lot easier now that I realize how simply a computer thinks. And how linear the computers processes generally are.<br><br>I'm going to persevere, Partly because I paid the $80 but also because when you understand the concepts behind a game, and a lot of the technical aspects behind how an engine works it's frustrating having to wait on other people to do things for you, and then not having something done as well as you would like for whatever reason. My hope is that in the future I'll be able to help with the basic setting up of a game design and do some of the things that are important to an artist like myself but often prove tedious to a engine coder that focuses more on the technical side of things.<br><br>All I can say is that its damned hard to start with, but it does get easier, and I think with a  mature IDE with more user friendly functions and proper debugger will help a lot and make things easier still. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
