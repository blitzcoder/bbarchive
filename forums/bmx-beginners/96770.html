I'm working on an overhead shooter where every sprite is rotated, every frame, and am wondering if I should optimise that? The only way I can think of is to make 360 copies of each image and pre-rotate them at the start of the program, then use those images instead.<br><br>I'd test this myself and check the FPS, but I don't actually know how to make the pre-rotated images. Presumably I take the initial image, draw it, rotated, to some buffer, then grab it from there? Been looking through the docs but can't find the correct commands.<br><br>I suppose the question is, is it worth it, or is rotating so fast now that it won't even speed up the program? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The same for scaling*.<br>What does pose a difference:<br>• The amount of shapes you send (relates to the amount of 'drawcalls').<br>• The quality of those shapes (relates to bandwidth, the amount of polygons in the shape and the cost of pixel and vertex shaders).<br>• Other state changes (having hundreds of different blend modes used every frame, or changing texture for every single sprite - texture size doesn't impact performance but the changing from one to another does).<br><br>So you can rotate and scale as much as you will. Post that shooter later on, on the Blitz Showcase! :)<br><br>(and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7VRWpr1UHw" target="_blank">listen to this</a>.)<br><br>*One could argue that scaling does affect performance in that it can potentially affect the fillrate - a big sprite covering the entire screen with some sort of blending is much more expensive than a sprite scaled down to a single pixel.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

(Fun games too)<br><br>I am very interested in the details. I like programming little games just for fun, and I've had an idea which I think will be quite fun to play, so as a project, I'm going to try to program it on BMAX and Monkey at the same time - mostly as a learning project for myself.<br><br>I have noticed in recent years - especially since I got this new PC, which is very powerful, that throwing huge amounts of sprites at the card doesn't seem to bother it at all. In my BMAX test, I had 10,000 small sprites spinning around without dropping below 60fps. Even with 100,000, it's still running at 28 fps. For someone who remembers programming on a ZX Spectrum.... well this just makes me feel old xD<br><br>I should read up on the way new 3d cards work, because I'm probably making mistakes in trying to avoid slow-downs. For example, for a scrolling starfield, would it be faster to have a bunch of tiled images (say 256x256) or just have 1000 pixels/small star images moving around? I had the idea that tiled images would be faster since it's only printing 10 or 20 of them, but when you consider the size of them, compared to a pixel, maybe the pixels are faster? This might be a slightly different issue though, where it's less work for the 3d card but more for the CPU? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Monkey can build for desktop too.<br><br>Don't have several images for the stars - even with them being small, each one would need a draw call which is very expensive.<br>You're better off using big square textures, like a combination of 1024 and 64, so you can reach a vertical resolution of 1080 with minimal waste of memory (like you would waste if you went straight with 2048). <br><br>Consult the GPU's "max texture size" value: In case it's lower than your biggest texture (say, 1024), you can downscale the image through software and then load that buffer as a texture that's appropriately sized. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
