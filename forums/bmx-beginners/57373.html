I searched linkedlist.bmx, and there is no GetLink() function.<br><br>I didn't ask if it was possible to make such a function.  I asked if there was one.  In the language.  In the help file.  There isn't.  I know you can make one yourself, but that's not what I was interested in.  The whole point of trying to use it in the first place was becuase I was lazily trying to save time instead of coding a custom repeat loop for looping through the linked list.

BUT this only happens if your type has a method compare that will return 0 if the types are "equal" according your definition of equal for this specific type.<br>The problem is your implementation. It only returns 0 if the other type is null which will never happen.<br><br>You should instead think about what "equalness" means in your list and set the return to reflect that.<br>If you can't think of another way than reference pointers, then my function above is the only way to go I fear. (I created the function so you do not need to hack the module and thus do not lose it on sync etc)<br>And no, this is not BMs fault but an OO rule that a compare functionality is used and not pointer references as they are not guaranteed to be the same in a managed environment. Normally that should not matter anyway. Even from the intuitive and "normal" point of view its clear, that objects are equal ie "reflect the same thing" if the have the same properties. Its just that you need to decide which properties make them unique and compare them :-)<br><br>For a sprite system, I would most likely use image, x,y,depth or even only image and depth for batched depthsorting. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
