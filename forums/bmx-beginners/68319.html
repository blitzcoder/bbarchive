You can leave out the doublebuffering flag when you create your graphics context, ie define the default flags for your graphics driver and make sure it doesn't include doublebuffering. Then when it gets created it doesn't automatically ask for or make a double buffer.<br><br>with glDrawBuffer(GL_FRONT) you can then output directly to the visible buffer. Remember the graphics card might not necessarily draw things as you ask for them, you may need to at some point do a glFlush() or glFinish().<br><br>Also, something to think about, if you really do ask for or get a double buffered context, and you try to choose the front buffer, it does not always work. Some systems will not represent front and back reliably. If you mix in doing a Flip(), even once, and then you try to ask for the front buffer to draw to, it may still output to the backbuffer, whereby back became front, but the way it does it is not consistent so you basically totally lose track of which buffer you really are looking at and which one you really want to ask to draw to. Moral of the story: don't ask for a double-buffer if you don't plan to use it, and ideally never call flip() if you're working on the front buffer.<br><br>Have no idea how you do this in DX, and don't care either ;-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
