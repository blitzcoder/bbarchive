If you leave out that part, it will open the images from the same folder as the program itself -- in that case you can move the files anywhere you want, as long as you keep them together.<br>(you can still organize your files e.g. by making a subdirectory 'images' for your images, and loading it as LoadPixmap("images\BigPicFrame.png")<br><br>Also: do you really need pixmaps? Unless you need to modify your images in real time, it's MUCH faster to use LoadImage and DrawImage instead. That way the images reside in the video memory of your video card, and don't need to be transferred over your PCI bus  to the video card every time you wish to draw them. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
