(as well, there are still things missing needed within BM itself for the 3D module like multithreading or at least mt safeness for using mt libs and callbacks. Simple reason: Networking without MT isn't going to work usefully and a game language which actively prevents usefull networking is just not acceptable anymore in 06)<br><br>But lets hope everything changes and we will soon be able to do real stuff with BM :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The squad leader (a higher rank unit) does decisions on his own if there is no input from the player. But to do so, he / she analyzes the informations you have as player as well, which affect his surrounding.<br>In the same time, all the squad members are animate units as well which analyze their environment. but to a far lower degree than the squad leader, as they are led by player / squad leader.<br><br>It is sadly not possible to do this analyze approach usefull as the user input sadly suffers heavily.<br>You are right, so far it is not fully optimized yet. But even with optimation, it won't make a difference that is high enough to make the whole thing even nearly playable in realtime on a non-monster system.<br>So far, it has only been possible to come around that doing virtual multithreading. But running 2 apps using UDP for "communication" isn't something I plan to use as "final idea".<br>Surely, a different way would be virtual multithreading.<br>But I'm sorry. Its 2006, even Windows is multithreading capable since Windows 98 and today, all new CPU are multi core. So why would I want fake something that is much more efficiently implemented into the system and hardware today, especially as the workload for me to fake it is far higher. (the other 2 supported OS know of multithreading for many more years you know. Can't remember right now, when Unix got it exactly, but long before MS implemented it in Windows)<br><br>And create it in another language with threading and statically import it sadly not possible as many tests done by others earliers showed (RakNet Wrapper as the "most current" one).<br><br>But ok, why discuss over it if even a very experience programmer does not see the reason for multithreading although the terrains in Blitz3D already showed WHY it would be usefull and the language would heavily benefit of it.<br><br>If this is the last word on threading, thats a sad thing, as it is the feature that will be most needed in future.<br><br>PS: I'm not looking for a high featured super end thing as in java or C#, as even tests in PureBasic with its mutex showed that that is already more than enough to get around the problems. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

BMax seems to be a true multi-purpose language (at least, I know <i>I'm</i> treating it as such) and there's just no reason that multi-threading shouldn't be incorporated. I'm not saying that Mark needs to drop everything he's doing to implement it. I know that won't happen, and I understand and respect that. Introducing MT probably won't earn him any extra money...well, yet that is.<br><br>After Max3D is out though, I think it'll become even more of a necessity. Max3D should draw some new customers to Blitz, and after it's completion Mark will hopefully continue to make BMax the great language it's on it's way to becoming. I mean, you toss MT into the mix, along with perhaps a more full-featured audio module, a bit more OO robustness, and there's little reason for any programmer working on a non-AAA title to choose C/C++ over BMax. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
