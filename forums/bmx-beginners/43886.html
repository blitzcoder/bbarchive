Is Open gl the same? (one 1024 x 1024 map better than 4 256 x 256 maps). Would it be better to use jpgs instead of bmps? (size of file seems smaller, but i do not know if at runtime it is the size of the map the one that matters) And finally, what sizes are recommended for texturing (speaking of textures for buildings, that will be displayed ).<br><br>Any help is very welcome, including probably some links to sample geometry and textures. Thanks. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Not make 1024x1024 textures becasue you can. Most people play games at 1280x1024 or less, so if an object in your game rearely takes up more than 1/4 of the screen, your probably won't need more than 512x512. If you have multiple maps on one 1024x1024 texture thats another matter.<br><br>Blitz3D would certainly benefit from fewer larger texures if you combined surfaces and shared textures. But with BLitzmax you will probably have to experiment for yourself and see what works best. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There are also some pretty good jpg tools that allow you to use different compression in other regions.<br><br>If your making a online downloadable game, you want the filesize as small as possible (obviously).<br><br>Pax, I'd recommend working on your textures at 1024x1024 and try smaller sizes see which give the best mix of quality and size. You might be surprised.<br><br>When I worked on the PS2 and Xbox, all the xbox textures were 256x256 with a handfull of larger ones 512x512, 512x1024 etc in 32bit with alpha. When we converted to PS2 we had to scale those 256x256 textures to 64x64 and 128x128 sometimes smaller and reduced the bitrates as low as we could, It's surprising how small you can get your textures and still have them look good. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you can get your download size below 5mb you will get about 60% more downloads than if it were 10mb. <br><br>And if it's under 1mb you will get many times more. You have to decide, Unless your using flat textures JPG can be fine. I prefer PNG though too, if your using fairly flat textures you might be able to use a custom pallet and save as PNG with 16,32 or 64 colours. Sometimes even a lightmap can look good in 8 bit. A single 2048x2048 lightmap would be at least 10mb as 24bit PNG, but may be only 300 - 500k if its 128 or 256 colours.<br><br>Just depends what your doing. I'm always looking to get the least expensive result as far as download size but still maintain the best quality possible. At the end of the day you have to find a good balance. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

One last question, though. Reducing bith depth is the same as compressing the image right (say jpg for instance)? In the sense that it'll only be lower for archive sizes, but at runtime it'll need the same video memory because it is the same size (else, i can use a lot of palete reduction, as my maps are turning out quite monochromatic).<br><br>Thanks again :D <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
