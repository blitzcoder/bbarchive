Not being BlitzMax the first programming language to come on my monitor, I'm not used to think at a compiler like a software to reverse engineer just to discover what is the return type of a function, or, for example, discover by trials and errors what the designer of the language meant by "map" (a hash indeed).<br><br>When I buy a compiler I expect that it comes at least with a complete, usable reference, not that it relies on third party books or community provided content for it to be fully usable by the costumers.<br><br>That said, could you please tell me what are the books you make reference to? Mind that I'm not really interested in books on programming or books on beginning game development as, if i have to skip 3 chapters where for loops are explained and 2 chapters where concepts like "movements are indeed sequences of static images", it would prove pretty useless to me.<br><br>That's also the reason why I was not complaining for the lack of a helpful community or tutorials, but about the lack of a simple yet handy and complete language reference.<br><br>Thanks again for your time. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I don't see why the response has to be "You don't like it, don't use it".  Any request to improvements of the language are fair to be asked for.  No different than if someone asked for some other improvement.<br><br>Sure, there are other means of figuring it out, looking through the source, searching the web, asking on the forums, etc.  But, I would think that better documentation could help sell more copies.  Heck, they could probably even make a bit more money off of it, by offering a hard copy manual for a profit. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
