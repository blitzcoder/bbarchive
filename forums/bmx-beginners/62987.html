My feeling, by looking at the codes, is that they confuse BlitzMAX. That feeling might come from my lack of skill in game/graphics programming. I really like to know if that is the case. Look at Blitz3D. The codes looks reasonable to me and a lot can be done in its environment, and it doesn't look like wrappers that are written for BlitzMAX. To me, a good 3D or physics for MAX needs to have a good and clear look code. <br><br>However, among these "ugly" wrappers, TV3D is the worse, and Lisa is the best. Actually, TV3D looks better in Visual Basic than in MAX, since you don't expect much in Visual Basic. Lots of hocus pocus to just code a cube!<br><br>Now, here is my problem. If ultimately, assume MAX can do 3D, I have to put all coming functions into my own OOP wrap, then perhaps all I have to do is to use one of these wrappers rather than using Blitz3D or waiting for "MAX3D". I hope you understand my problem, and I appreciate your comments or guides.  <br><br>One more thing. I know programmers needs to make living. If I pay for these wrappers, I will only do so to promote the programming language "community" that I am in. But these programmers must also understand that I am doing so for that purpose, they will make money by the amount of their loyalty to the community, or I hope so.<br><br>from a hobby game programmer! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I plan to use Irrlicht via GMan's wrapper until switching over to Max3D.  To make this easier, I plan to "wrap the wrapper" with my own functions (probably similar to Blitz3D's, since they're familar to me) so that I can just modify my wrapper to use Max3D functions in place of Irrlicht functions.  There'll doubtless be some manual cleanup/recoding required, but I hope to minimize it by never calling an Irrlicht function directly.<br><br><div class="quote"> I would wait for max3d because it will worth it. <br></div><br>I'd have agreed with you last year, since that's what I did then. I'd even decided to wait until the end of <i>this</i> year for Max3D. But since it now appears (to me only, which might not match anyone else's view) that Max3D won't do what I need it to until several months into 2007, I've decided not to wait for 3D in BlitzMax any longer.  It'll take some work going with a wrapper then switching what's been written with it over to Max3D later, but at least this way I can do <i>something</i> in 3D with BlitzMax. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The wrapper copies the syntax of the engine almost perfectly. In fact, I had to go to a lot of work to make it function identically to how TV3D works in other languages. You can port code back and forth between VB, C# and BlitzMax with little or no effort, and I have to say I'm proud of that because it makes it a lot more useful that way.<br><br>If you don't like TV3D's syntax then blame TV3D. It's pretty insulting to blame me when my wrapper is a near-complete clone of the original though. Now if I'd imposed my own vision on the wrapper and forced you to go around the houses in a way in which TV3D did not, then I would very much deserve criticism, but please lay the blame at the right door. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Politics in technical area is a “sin” for me. <br><br>Please read what I wrote as something written from a technically non-expert. In this way, you might understand me better. So, those who took me optimistically are those who understood me. Those who took me pessimistically, they did it because I mistakenly wrote a judgmental sentence about TV3D, and I especially apologies to Gabriel. I didn’t know he wrote the wrapper. Please notice again, as he mentioned too, that all I wrote was from the point of view of non-expert user. Perhaps, if one day I become a better programmer, I would find his wrapper a good one. <br><br>Generally speaking, technical capabilities of those who write wrappers are unquestionable and their works are admirable. One of you wrote that I may not be able to write my own wrapper. That might be true, and actually I never tried. I usually design simple classes and I am happy with them as they do the job efficiently for my own purpose. I don't enjoy writing codes for OpenGL or Direct X or other higher level engines, unless someone pay me.

An assembly language code looks great to the coder. Perhaps what you have done may look good to someone else, but you can't tell me why I express my opinion. Let people make their own decision especially beginners in game programming.<br>2 - Actually this discussion is telling me that some come to this forum to sell their products. I thought this forum is for learning especially for beginners. Imagine you guys fill every corner of this forum and try to sell not to help!! Why you sellers don't go to more advanced users and sell them. <br>3 - The implicit business logic of wrapper-sellers dictates to come in to sell, not to help, because the more they help, the fewer beginners may not need their wrapper. <br>4 – My suggestion to Blitz Research is to create a separate area for those who want to sell.
