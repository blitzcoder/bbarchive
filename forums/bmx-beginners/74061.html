I'm sorry Import lovers, I know the fault lies at me, but that doesn't solve the problem. ._.<br><br>I keep having to compromise and uglify the structure of my source files, which previously had a very nice and easy to understand structure. But now they are one big clustered nonsense of spiderwebs. What I gain in compile time, I lose by tenfolds by simply having to navigate though this mess. Seaching for this problem on the community only gives answers like "yeah, you can include all the types that need each other into one big file and import that". Why should I need to make life harder in order to use a tool that is supposed to make life easier? IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. &gt;&gt;<br><br>But, it doesn't end there. I also keep experiencing other small problems, like constants not applying over an imported source file, but yet, it won't allow me to make new constants in the imported file to make up for it. Despite that it doesn't bother to load the values, it seems well aware that the constant exists, and refuses to let me fix up the problem that it has created.<br><br>Now, tell me, what am I doing wrong? &gt;&gt;<br><br>And how can I become friends with Import again before I leave her for Include forever? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
