However, part of BRL's design (I think) is that they would prefer you don't directly access fields. It's supposedly not object-oriented enough, because if they go changing the Image type in the future, maybe renaming some fields or changing what they mean, it would break your code. That's why they often have things like ImageWidth() to `get` the field in a standard consistent way. Ie the interface to the type is a consistent API for the programmer and you shouldn't be worried about what goes on under the hood. But that said, most of BlitzMax is probably pretty stable and fixed by now so you can probably use .field access pretty safely. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

However, IIRC, the order and number of fields and methods in interface files (.i) matters.
