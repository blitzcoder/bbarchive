Anyway, I thought I might ask a couple of questions of the helpful people here?<br><br>1. I've read through and followed along with a couple of tutorials, and have managed to understand what's going on until they start talking about types and classes and methods and whatnot. I'm comfortable with if statements, comfortable with functions, with select and while and for/next and so on... but when I read code that has types in it, I have a vague feeling that I understand in an abstract sort of way what each line is doing, but no confidence at all that I could produce something myself that would do the same thing. Is it important to keep hammering away at this concept until I get it, or can I get away with playing with the stuff I can already understand until I'm more confident?<br><br>2. As an exercise today I made a little "pong" clone, with bats, a ball, bouncing, everything you can imagine! While I have the same kind of huge, insanely over-ambitious projects in mind that every starting game-creator begins with, I suspect that there might be some intermediate stages between pong and My Dream Game. Can you recommend something I could or should try to make as a small project that will teach me more than I learned from making pong but is still small and simple enough that I won't get lost and dejected halfway through? Any recommendations gratefully appreciated!<br><br>...thanks in advance for any help or advice! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It even has some features that are missing from the version in assari's tutorial, with the ball reflecting properly from bricks and with a variable angle of bounce from the paddle depending on where the ball strikes.<br><br>So... my question is, should I keep working on it? I've seen advice in various places saying "finish what you start, don't flit from one project to the next just because it gets hard, you learn more by sticking with something until it gets better". And I can see the sense in that advice, and I'm sure I could learn a lot from improving my breakout game, by adding things like multiple levels, different types of bricks, powerups, a proper high-score table, and so on... some of those things I only have a vague idea how to make, and some, none at all. So I would learn a lot.<br><br>However, on the downside, I really have no interest in breakout as a game, or in action games generally. The reason I want to learn to program is to make turn-based games. So the thought of spending a whole lot of time polishing and improving a game that I'm never going to actually like feels a bit de-motivating for me. Still... I understand at the moment the purpose of what I'm doing is not really to make stuff so much as to learn how to make stuff, so if it's the best way forward I probably can make myself keep at it.<br><br>And on a related note: whether it's now or later, I'm going to move on and make a simple turn-based game as a basis for starting to learn how to make turn-based, rather than real-time, games. Any suggestions for a good place to start? I was thinking of maybe implementing a computer version of Hive*, but... not sure if that would be aiming too high to begin with.<br><br>Any thoughts, comments or suggestions greatly appreciated!<br><br>* - See <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2655" target="_blank">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2655</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
