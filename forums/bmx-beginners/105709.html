	Enumerate over NTFS Alternate Data Streams attached to a file/dir


	What is NTFS Alternate Data Streams?
	
		General syntax for streams are "FILENAME:STREAMNAME" 
		or the longer "FILENAME:STREAMNAME:$DATA"
		
		Most file apis handle the FILE:STREAM syntax, 
		but for those that dont (some cli apps) you can use pipes.
		
		Note that there is no indication that a file has any streams 
		attached to it in explorer, not even the size is incremented.
		
		And handling the file outside explorer/cli
		(eg sending over network, archiving, etc) 
		makes the file loose its streams.

	Requirements:
		Windows Vista / Windows Server 2003 and above
		NTFS Volumes
