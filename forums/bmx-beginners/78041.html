You could support these in your pseudo-language, but it keeps looking less and less like BASIC and more like an unnecessary variation on GLSL.<br><br>GLSL has a lot of niggles that a CPU language doesn't.  Things like dynamic loops are not possible or not supported on &lt;SM4.0 hardware.  Or for example it is not allowed to get a value from an output variable like gl_FragColor.<br><br>So the end results would be something like the following.<br><br>GLSL:<br><pre class=code>uniform float appTime;

void Main() {
vec4 pos = ModelViewMatrix * gl_Vertex;
gl_Position = pos;
#ifdef _GLSL_CG_TYPE
gl_ClipVertex = pos;
#endif
}</pre><br><br>BASIC SL:<br><pre class=code>uniform appTime#

Function Main()
Local pos:TVec4
pos = ModelViewMatrix * gl_Vertex
gl_Position = pos
#ifdef _GLSL_CG_TYPE
gl_ClipVertex = pos
#endif
EndFunction</pre><br>So instead of making your shader code cleaner and more compact, it just makes it nonstandard and confusing, being neither BASIC nor GLSL.  Not really worth it, in my opinion. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There's a number of powerful libs that extend its capabilities (ParticleCandy, SpriteCandy, shadow libs, pathfinding code etc..) and I have an extensive codebase to work from.<br><br>It's also stable - which is not something to be overlooked. When your game finally hits the public, having a forum full of people angrily complaining about crashes/freezes is neither desirable nor fun. I suspect that the people who put down B3d for not having the latest shader fx don't take enduser stability into much account. I've had a few bugs pop up with TU but the worst of these (Vista crash), was actually down to a programming error - not Blitz.<br><br>Having said that, Blitz is not very fast - both in running code and the graphics engine. <br><br>Which is a quandary - if I go to Blitzmax I lose all of the excellent libs much of my codebase depends upon - and my codebase would need to be rewritten. <br><br>If I stay with Blitz3d but use a new engine (via dll), I'd still have a lot of recoding to look at.

Occlusion culling is performed on the GPU, so there is no need for portal systems or BSP trees.  The materials system works the same on everything, so you don't have to worry about bumpmapping lightmapped surfaces or baked vertex colors...the engine doesn't know or care if it is rendering a wall, a car, or a person, it's all just triangles running through the same render and lighting path.<br><br>Now that I have been working with this system for a while, I could never go back to a system of baked low-res textures that sort of look like blurry shadows.

I tried making my own models procedurally and they end up incompatible with a shadow system.  And I absolutely need to build my models from inside the engine as it goes with the concept of my game plan.<br><br>When I saw CSG implemented for BlitzMax ( <a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=74293" target="_blank">http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=74293</a> ), I was more than happy, only to find thow, that the speed taken for one operation is just too demanding for realtime gaming in  Blitzmax.  So, that is why I haven't gone Blitzmax really.  But having this in a game engine would of course facilitate having a really fast working implementation and ease of use.  I do not think it has ANYTHING to do with a physics engine, but more with model building, maintenance.  It is just a convenience to have CSG and physics talk together imho.<br><br>I know I won't be the poor soul coding a CSG engine, but I absolutely need this for my project.  It saddens me that DarkBasic has it, which is a language I will never program in, or use DarkGDK or PureGDK even thoe I gave it some reflection not so long ago.  I think game development would change a lot if we had CSG, a lot of creative souls would rise. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
