If you are curious, the call to the DLL/Userlib looks like this- X and Y are the grids internal data, while it's multiplied by the patch poly count, giving you a perfect square:<br><br>Noise#=Perlin#(NoiseID, x+(terrain\x*TerrainPolyCount),y-(terrain\y*TerrainPolyCount),1,terrain\Frequency,terrain\Lacunarity,terrain\Persistence,terrain\Octaves,terrain\Quality)<br><br>So I'm hinging on a decision to buy BlitzMax and convert all of this to XORS3D, because sadly Blitz3D's outdated engine is slogging through how many polys i really want to be pushing with this generator, but i'm stuck trying to think about how I would have such complex noise generation within Blitzmax. NoiseGen offers a lot of different noise techniques with minimal effort, and I feel lazy for avoiding learning how to implement these functions properly- I just want to drive the car, not build it from scratch!<br><br>I looked at some noise functions, but none of the could be "continued" in such a fashion that you can keep generating from the same seed and the results are consistent and can be tiled. Am I missing something with how these functions work? Did I not dig far enough?<br><br>I've tried porting the NoiseGens code, but know NOTHING about FreeBasic (which i think is what the source MusiciansKool provided is written in- .bas? Anyone?) so i tried wrapping the DLL by simply doing Proc calls to it. It initializes the seed and will generate exactly ONE result before crashing with an exception.<br><br>So I feel like i'm in over my head. Does anyone have any pointers on what I should do? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

When I made the jump myself some years ago it took me a bit to get my head around it - well worth it of course, and I shudder at the thought of using Blitz3D again now.<br><br>My point is, there will be so much learning to do in the migration that time and projects will pass before you are ready to do a finished game again, i'd do a simple project in 2D first before tackling 3D - learn as if from day 1 but have the added benefit of your experience with Blitz3D to breeze through it, rather than go for the big complex project first.<br><br>In theory though, it's just a dll you mention right?  So accessing it would be easy. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It can apparently handle very large maps with excellent performance at the moment.<br><br>Because... if you're being weighed down by the complexity of models, it's only partially Blitz3D's problem: any engine you replace it with will only be able to significantly improve on that issue if it has a LOD system built-in (I think doing it completely automatically requires DirectX11, so won't feature in Xors3D - although my understanding of this is rather limited). Polygons have to be rendered, or dropped from rendering, one way or another.<br><br><br>The DLL you linked is a B3D userlib, so the functions in it use the _stdcall convention and therefore I think you need to specify "Win32" or something like that when calling functions from BlitzMax, because I believe it defaults to cdecl, which might result in you corrupting the stack. Just guessing here. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But this thing I'm creating here is quickly outgrowing Blitz3D, and sadly- I think it's about time I place it on the shelf for good.<br><br>Yasha- Sadly, It appears the download for BlitzTiles is defunc :( anyone have a copy? I think i could make it work with how I'm generating tiles- Since it just takes heightmap data. Do mind that I am using meshes instead of Blitz3Ds built-in terrain. I've seen other systems that used Terrain instead of mesh, but never had a chance to grab BlitzTiles; Guess this is what I get for not being on the community board!<br><br>I have SOME LOD in, however- I'd really like the boost you get from DirectX9, as well as some of the advanced features such as shaders and a little more overhead in rendering (though from my tests, it still suffers from the overall "large batch" bottleneck- screeching to around the same FPS as Blitz3D with the same amount of entities to render, so isn't exactly a magic bullet if you want MORE entities, just higher detail. :( ).<br><br>Lastly, I found the DECLS generator somewhere on the board and ran the Noisegen declarations through it, and out popped:<br><br><pre class=code>Strict
