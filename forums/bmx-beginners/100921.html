But have you defined your image variables as TImage?  A mistake made by many in the Blitzmax early days, was to define images as their default Integers (because that's how Blitzbasic did it).  This caused colossal memory leaks in some circumstances.  As I said, I don't know if Blitzmax even still allows that.<br><br>Anyway, you mentioned you were loading graphics into local variables within functions.  Does that mean you are loading them once only, or repeatedly every time you draw the screen?  If could be that you're causing the GC to work overtime.<br><br>Since you mentioned optimization (or lack thereof), here's your starter for ten:<br><pre class=code>
	For c = 0 To 10
		If Sqr((ballX - f[c].x) ^ 2 + (ballY - f[c].y) ^ 2) &lt; distToBall Then
			distToBall = Sqr((ballX - f[c].x) ^ 2 + (ballY - f[c].y) ^ 2)
			closestPlayer = c
		End If

</pre><br><br>Change this to:<br><pre class=code>
	For c = 0 To 10
                Local dist:Int = (ballX - f[c].x) ^ 2 + (ballY - f[c].y) ^ 2
		If dist &lt; distToBall
			distToBall = dist
			closestPlayer = c
		End If
	Next
</pre><br>Why?  Well, you do not need to know the distance between the player and ball - you only need to know who is closest.  For this reason you do not need all those Sqr() calls, since you can glean the information you need just from the product of the ball/player positions.<br><br>Second, storing the calculation in a local variable means you only have to do it once, rather than potentially twice per loop. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You should call Flip just once.<br><br>This is how it works: Everything is drawn on a backgroud buffer. Once you call 'Flip' this buffer is transfered to the visible screen, and everything that is drawn after that, is drawn on another background buffer. <br><br>Calling FLIP twice in the loop will show one of the images very fast, and then the second one. You won't get both on the screen at the same time.<br><br>In your code you have "ShowPlayers()/Flip" and "DrawLines()/Flip". You'll be able to see the lines, the players probably will "flicker" or not show at all.<br><br>Second, separate your drawing code from your update/logic code, so you get something like this:<br><br><pre class=code>
while not done
   time = millisecs()

   draw_images()
   flip

   updatelogic(abs(millisecs() - time))
wend
</pre><br><br>By moving everything in time steps, no matter if you get slowdowns or not, your code will try to keep up a best as possible.<br><br>This is how you would update your movement (just an example from the top of my head):<br><br><pre class=code>
function updatelogic(time:float)
   ball.x = ball.x + ball.SpeedX * (time/1000.0)
end function
</pre><br><br>And as for optimization, I would go even further on that code above:<br><pre class=code>
	For c = 0 To 10
                Local dx:int = (ballX - f[c].x)
                Local dy:int = (ballY - f[c].y)
                Local dist:Int = dx*dx + dy*dy
		If dist &lt; distToBall
			distToBall = dist
			closestPlayer = c
		End If
	Next
