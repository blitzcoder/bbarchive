It comes with Vista, etc, etc.  I tested my own code examples. the popular BMax game "Annihilation" and GA's framework test. <br><br>Graphics Card: ATI Radeon Express 1150<br><br>"Annihilation" - In OpenGL mode, things ran horribly. Very slow, choppy, etc. Annihilation reported frame rates of less than three fps. In DirectX mode, things were much better. Full screen ran flawless, very smooth, very fast in all tests. Windowed mode was choppy. The mouse was very erratic. In full screen mode frame rates were in the 90's to 100's in all tests. In windowed mode, frame rates were never out of the 30's. In both full screen and windowed, audio played fine.<br><br>VSYNC is useless, VSYNC needs to be on on this laptop, otherwise horrible tearing, etc.<br><br>Onto my own code tests. Open GL didn't work at all. DirectX ran fine in full screen, windowed mode was choppy as before. The MGE Bass Module worked flawlessly I'm happy to report. <br><br>(My previous DirectX 8 engine in VB6 suffered the same choppiness in windowed mode, so it wasn't just related to DX7. phew...!)<br><br>GA's framework test "Attack of the Mutant Greys" suffered the same results. OpenGL mode fails. Plus there was no sound/music. Full screen mode ran smooth as butter, very nice! Windowed mode was choppy just like the other tests.<br><br>This was my first time playing around with Vista. Nice operating system, I'm a little concerned about creating fast action games however. Perhaps desktop pc's will perform better. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Please check your system or card creators page for more recent drivers. (CDs shipped with systems and components often don't have the most current drivers)<br><br>Especially Vista users have to be aware what they bought, they can't expect it to run on the same level as WindowsXP, therefor it is just too broken at the moment.

I do consider this mostly just vista newness pains though and more complete drivers will be shipping with new computers in the future.  this "old driver" problem though is not just with OpenGL though.  Someone wasn't able to play my invaders from space on a 1-2 year old XP machine in either DX or opengl.  once they upgraded the drivers both worked as expected. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Lots of consumers seem to be going for budget machines (so no high-end GFX for the big commercial games) while OpenGL now comes as absent -- as a games platform the PC looks like a right shabby mess at the moment.<br><br>EDIT: Oh I just wanted to be clear that I'm not criticising MGE there -- it's really daft that a new Inspiron with Vista performs worse out of the box than my old 1300 with XP. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
