It only needs to draw the complete inventory image.<br><br>I've been searching through the forums, but didn't find any solution yet.<br>I've read that most people would draw the empty inventory to the backbuffer, draw all the icons to the backbuffer too, same as the overlaying text (which represents the quantity of every item) and finally grab the image. But this is sloooooowwww.<br><br>As it's an inventory which will change frequently during the game (everytime the player picks up an item), I think I cannot afford to grab the image, as it's too slow.<br><br>How can I solve this, as BMax doesn't use buffers, like Blitz3D.<br><br>Or is BMax fast enough to draw the empty inventory image, 60 icons (size 32x32), 60 lines of text, and a few rects every frame?<br>I still need to draw other stuff on the screen, so it needs to be fast. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

</pre><br><br>the thing is you are trying to mix different types with nothing in common but if you store only common items in a base type you wont have that problem.<br>like say, for example, bullets and arrows will both have speed and maybe life and cause damage so those three variables can be used as fields in the base type. and wont need to be casted back to the original one. but if you are trying to put bullets and potions and shields and create a common base type for all of them, you will have to deal with stuff like what I posted above. in a way it sort of defeat the purpose of derived types or polymorphing which is what you are trying to do. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
