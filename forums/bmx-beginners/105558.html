I would call it "lacking on far-sight".<br><br>Like I described in #3 already - which is similar to what Bobysait in #6 suggested, you just adjust the velocity of the objects.<br><br>If you want to keep the velocity constant, you could also increase the frequency of physical/logical world updates (I would prefer the "gameSpeedFactor"-approach). Of course you need to decouple Logic and rendering first (which makes it independend of potential "flip"-limitations).<br><br>Just check the various "delta timing" discussions here on the board.<br><br><br>Loop (until GameExit / Key_Escape / ...):<br>- UpdateWorld() as much as needed for that "cycle"<br>- If enough cycle-time available: RenderWorld() 1x for that cycle<br>- delay()/sleep for the rest of the cycle-time<br>(in my game I adjusted it to have physic and render calls limited - so eg 60 PhysicUpdates/s and 30 Render/s - keeps CPU usage low)<br><br><br>UpdateWorld() is there to move objects, to check for colliding entities, to adjust gamestates, send network packets, handle input ...<br><br>RenderWorld() is doing nothing than representing the current state of the world ... no (logical) movement or other things are done.<br>Now the exception: you _could_ do some kind of movement: if you render more often than "UpdateWorld()" is called (because your computer is faster and power consumption is of no matter for you) you have to adjust offset entities: lastX + (x-lastX) * cycleProgress. So the nearer the "next update" is, the lower the distance of the entity to the "x"-value of the update call.<br><br><br>While Bobysait now suggested to use some kind of "gameSpeedFactor" (in his case the velocity).<br>Per Update your entity moves then:<br><br>x :+ dx * deltaTime * gameSpeedFactor<br>x ... position on x<br>dx ... speed on x axis (the scalar value/magnitude of "velocity" - so no "direction" described within)<br>deltaTime ... fraction of a second<br>gameSpeedFactor ... world speed modifier<br><br>If you eg. define your world to update 50 times per second, your deltaTime will be 1.0/50 seconds (20ms -&gt; 0.02s).<br>You then define your "dx" no longer "frame depending" (2px per frame) but in "px per second". (or you even get more flexible by defining it in "% of screenwidth" or something more independent).<br><br>To avoid "jittering" (sometimes it is updated 19ms later, sometimes 21ms because of some inaccuracies or hickups) you then offset the entities in your render-call by the amount of time passed then ...<br><br><br><br>So another hint: before you are now replying with "short example code so people could easily try out":<br><br>shortening<br><pre class=code>
local a:int = 5, b:int = 5
print (a+b)
</pre><br><br>with<br><pre class=code>
print 10
</pre><br>is - while having a similar result - not some code others benefit of.<br><br><br><br>Seriously: _if_ you really persist on using your "flip" : check at the begin of your loop if you are doing a "flip" in this cycle, and if not, do not do "DrawText" or other things. They wont be seen so save the processing. And like told in another thread: depending on the graphics engine (DX, OGL) the heavy load is done by flip() - or already the Draw-Commands. <br><br>BTW: I am going partially d'accord with one of your phrases: that skipping Flips() helps on slower computers.<br>Maybe your code would look more "physics / render separating" when not doing the Draw-things regardless of skipped flips or not (because I am assuming, that you mean the right thing, but your code is expressing/first-glance-showing the opposite). Nonetheless your code is adding constant values to the entities - regardless of potential cpu hickups ...<br><br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

</textarea><br><br>Brian, once you transfer this code to BlitzMAX, press CTRL-F and FIND all occurrences of "lv#" (el vee pound) Abbreviation for LEVEL. See how they are used. So if you use a real variable (one that can contain a decimal point) like this which increases a tiny bit over time, everything it is associated with will neatly start to accelerate.<br><br>Hope This Helps ! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It is up to the OP to accept deltatiming (and the multiplied speedAdjustmentFactor) as potential answer and to research a bit further on its own. If not...you end up answering very individual questions ("how to move a spaceship in a curvy way" vs "how to move an object on a curve path"... the second one might lead to algorithms containing bezier-curves with some tracking/control points).<br><br><br>Nonetheless...we already described a working "logic"... and the OP should request "code" if he really needed code then... this helps keeping threads clean and the content easy to follow. You know have multiple "samples" posted...and the OP even did not respond...and I doubt that this is based on "so many replies, so few working example codes". People who really want to code...enjoy being included in an discussion rather than copy pasting others work. And I would prefer helping people interested in coding.<br><br><br>Back to delta: why is this useful?<br>It allows to have a constantly and "smooth" increasement of the worldSpeed-Factor (if you want to increase in "x per second"). If you increase per "each run 100 meters" you of course do it differently and wont need deltaTime(Factor).<br><br><br>Bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
