It really does help to organize things. It's a somewhat different mindset than procedural programming but in many cases it helps you keep things where they should be.<br><br>I also think that just because you might be somewhat new to some of the concepts in BlitzMax, that doesn't mean you deserve to be cut down or used as a skapegoat for other people's aggression. If you believe you can do it and it's your dream, who is anyone to try stopping you.<br><br>I agree with the idea that you may be best off having a script engine and not try to produce your own executables, unless you are looking to a LOT of extra very complicated and low-level work. You could create a stripped down `runtime module` which is your basic engine but with no built-in interfaces etc, then let the game creators distribute that runtime app with their game resources, and allow them to rename it and give it a different icon. Then the customer will think they're running a custom executable program. What does it matter that you generate an exe yourself when all it basically needs to do is load in the game resources and `play` the scripts. That's how AMOS Basic originally did it before it had its own compiler - the RAMOS (runtime amos) was a little program with all the functionality, script engine, graphics, sound etc, that would load in the script sourcecode and interpret it at runtime. It sounds like this is along the lines of what you are planning to do and it probably the best option. I don't really think you can easily use incbin because you have to either then compile the app with the blitzmax compiler or hack into a previously created exe file and modify it correctly, not easy to do.<br><br>What kind of games do you think your editor etc will be able to create and to what degree of advancement? Will it be for any type of 2d game or a certain genre? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You may think you're being nice and encouraging, but if the person you're advising really isn't up to the job (YET) - and everything he's posted indicates as much - then all he's going to do is fail, get disheartened and throw it in the bin.<br><br>If he follows the advice given by H&amp;K, GFK, and SSwift, he stands a good chance of getting the skills and experience he needs to make what he wants to make in the end. No one's suggesting he's stupid, or lacking in ability, because we all know that programming isn't particularly difficult. It's just a case of practice, starting slowly, developing your skills, increasing your confidence and you're there.<br><br>So yes, he can do it.

Yes I said I didnt know anything about types, but BM is different. I created another topic asking if it would be possible to include a keyword called class. I am use to calling them classes. B3D and BP types were not anything like C# classes. Now that I know BM types are basically classes, I understand them. I have written basic "games" that let you control a ship and shoot blue blocks that explode. Wasnt hard once I learned types are simple classes.<br><br>As for the game maker, yes, when I said I dont know how to create exe's I was saying I dont know how to get my program to make them. Can I use the built in BM commands? If so, which set? (not specifics... id rather fiddle with certain sections of commands and learn myself).<br><br>Or how would I "insert" resources into an already made .exe?

I have used game maker and DBP (which i only stopped using because it didnt have OOP and was fairly slow compared to BM). And I didnt know types were just like C# classes... I havent made a game some one would like to play once in a while, but I have made some basic engines to play with. I know game concept well... but not really game maker concept.

I don't think there's really a good way to modify an existing exe that has incbin's in it. When you compile the app it has to know where the incbin's are and how big they are. I very much doubt there is anything variable about that, and you wouldn't know where in the exe file the incbin data is stored - if it's not at the end, you can't really overwrite it will a different amount of data or you'll go past the buffer and overwrite some code or something. Also trying to mess with exe files has more involved, things like checksums and reference tables and all that jazz. I would go with having an executable runtime module which is basically the engine, then like H&amp;K said have resources that you load in that the user can edit. You can let them also edit scripts and if the script language/interface is detailed enough and gives enough options it will let them basically rewire your engine to make it do different things.<br><br>Making an exe you're going to have to learn about how they are structured and how things are allocated and all that complicated low-level o/s stuff.<br><br>As to letting the user make the game, you will need editors or some kind which automate a lot of stuff and let the user create quick results without much work. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
