Anyway I know I could use arrays to strore the board or pit. But I figured that maybe linked lists would be a good alternative because I could easily remove a line from the list (providing each item in the list was a line on the board), and it would be easy to add new empty lines to the top of the pit/board.<br>     How would I represent a line in each item in the list? I thought of using a binary representation. Is this a good idea. Can anyone help? I'd be grateful<br>     I'd also like to know if there is a way you can directly reference an arbitray item in a list (like in an array), by number. e.g. list(10)., without having to cycle through the list. I thought of using an array of pointers to each item in the list, but I was wondering if there is a less-fudged way of doing it. Thank you very much :)<br><br>Rico <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The board (TBoard) was a regular 2d array, of TBlock.<br><br>A TBlock has an x and y, relative to position of the shape, not actual game coordinate. For example, 0, 0 is the central pivot of the shape, 0, 1 is to the right of the shape<br><br>Each tetris shape has only 4 blocks, so give a TShape an array of 4 TBlocks. I was first tempted to give each a 4x4 array as this would fit any shape, in order to store the shape, but an array of 4 is simplier, trust me.<br><br>A TShape so far has 4 TBlocks, and also needs an x and y for it on the board. This is where the central block is located. So if it's at 5, 6 on the board, then block of coordinate 0, 1 will be at 5, 7.<br><br>Your block will also need whether it's active, rotatable etc and other overhead.<br><br>What's the point of this 4 block array? It makes rotating VERY simple. Simply create a temperary 4 block array that is rotated, pick up the piece off the board, and try and place the temp array. If it works, set the actual array to the temp array. If it doesn't, replace the original array - it cannot rotate.<br><br>I found the rotating algorithm, and some other ideas, from this site:<br><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/game/tetriscontrol.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.codeproject.com/KB/game/tetriscontrol.aspx</a><br>which has since been deleted, so here is my code.

	End Method</textarea><br><br>This is all well and good, but how does the piece inform the board where it is, for collision checking?<br><br>The TBlocks on the board aren't to hold their own blocks, but will references the TBlocks in the arrays inside TShape in order to know that they are there. When placing a piece, loop through the 4-block array and by using the absolute coordinate of the piece and the relative coordinate of each block, to set the TBlock cell in the board array to reference it. When removing the block, simply dereference the cell in the board. (This way is my own idea).<br><br>I think I've given you the general idea. If I've missed any points off or you need something explaining better, please ask.<br><br><br>About your question about using lists, the board is so small that it is acceptable to simply start at the top of the board and move everything downwards. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
