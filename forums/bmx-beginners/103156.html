There are several features it doesn't have (on account of being simpler), but the only real <i>difference</i> I can think of that might actually trip you up, coming from those languages, is that all methods are virtual, more like Java; you don't need to either explicitly declare them as such, or to declare an override (while you can "seal" a method with Final, there's no way to truly make it "non-virtual" as such - it just prevents further use of the name altogether). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This impressed me a lot as I always wanted to make my own small RPG - which always failed because of the *massive* amount of programming needed if you want to do it right (not even considering the amount of data!).<br>When I saw Eschalon it was proof enough for me that BMax is able to handle the complexity of an RPG and provides enough performance, even on lower-spec'ed machines.<br><br><div class="quote"> I'm looking at the BMX code and it just seems really straightforward. <br></div><br>IMHO this is one of the major advantages.

Seems like this forum is a nice welcoming place which is huge in terms of eliminating barriers.<br><br>==========<br>Follow up question.  I like the way that these apps seem to have all their graphical icons (and even levels) in application dirs where the code can reference them.

Others like specialized pixel-art-tools (think you should surf some pixel-art-boards for this question).<br><br>@resource directories<br><br>It is upon you to decide where to store your resources. Often assets are stored within the binary while "user data" is stored in other directories ("appdata", "home directory" ...).<br><br>If you only want to code for "fun" this is no trouble, but when you try to publish the apps, you will have to use the system provided folders for userdata.<br><br><br>@TVTower<br>I would not suggest my project for "beginners" (language wise) as it is some kind of a beast evolving since ~12 years (but it gets better each refactoring :p).
