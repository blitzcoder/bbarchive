-------------------------------
Core Version 1.05 : 07 Mar 2005
-------------------------------

***** Changes to MacIDE *****

+ Moved MacOS .app dir creation from IDE to BMK.

+ Added Build GUI App menu item.

+ Now saves locked build filename if reopen files at startup is selected.

+ Added character encoding to preferences. This is the 'save' encoding -
load encoding is determined automatically.


***** Changes to BMK *****

+ Fixed file leak in bbdoc.

+ C compiler now emits warnings.

+ Fixed BMK recognizing rem'd out Imports.

+ Fixed MacOS Tiger issue - should work OK on Tiger now.

+ Moved MacOS .app dir creation from IDE to BMK.

+ Added -t (app type) option, eg: "-t console", or "-t gui"


***** Changes to BCC *****

+ Added utf8/utf16 source file support. Source files must start with  correct byte 'markers' to be detected: $ef,$bb,$ff for UTF8; $fe,$ff for UTF16 big endian and $ff,$fe for UTF16 little endian.

+ Stricter import filetype checking: import source file type
must be one of bmx,c,m,s,asm,cpp,cxx,o,a,lib and source file must exist.

+ RestoreData labels back in strict mode. Strict mode labels must now appear before a For/While/Repeat/DefData statement.


-------------------------------
Core Version 1.04 : 14 Feb 2005
-------------------------------

***** Changes to BCC *****

+ Added labelled loops (strict mode only). Labels must be preceded by a '#' and must appear immediately before a For, While or Repeat loop. The label can then be used with Exit/Continue, eg:

Strict
#outer_loop
For Local k=1 To 10
  #inner_loop
  For Local j=1 To 10
    Print "k="+k+", j="+j
    If k=5 And j=5 Exit outer_loop
  Next
Next

Exit/Continue without a label just exits/continues the nearest surrounding loop, as per usual.

+ Fixed non-const Global initializer code re-executing everytime global statement visited.

+ Fixed debug stm info hardcoded to build blitzmax dir



***** Changes to Mac IDE *****

+ Fixed 'Replace All' confusing line numbering.


***** Changes to BMK *****

+ Now uses bin/bbdoc instead of internal doccer.

+ Tweaked GCC args for better x86 FPU code generation.

+ Added http escaping for syncmods user and pass.

+ Added -y proxy_host:proxy_port option for proxies.

+ Added better checking for unsupported file types which were previously being silently ignored.


***** Changes To BCC *****

* 'Power of' now always used doubles.

* Fixed uninitialized 'resolved' field of 'ClassType'.

+ Fixed const global byte/short initializer bug on little endian machines.

+ Changed 'Release' so it only takes an int variable parameter.

+ Fixed missing Long Min/Max.

+ Fixed debug info being generated for Type functions.

+ Changed default Extern Global munging from "bb_" prefix to none.

+ Fixed arithmetic type balancing so 2 float32 operands mean a float32 result as per spec.

+ Fixed unusued Long return vals hanging compiler.

***** Changes to BRL.Blitz (1.02) *****

+ Beefed up operator ^.

+ Fixed 64 bit Linux compile problem.


***** Changes to BRL.AppStub (1.01) *****

+ Fixed functions in expressions confusing current statement in debugger.

+ Cleaned up appstub.win32.c a bit. Removed _control87 setup and FPE handling.


***** Changes to BRL.Math (1.01) *****

+ Recompiled for faster math ops.


***** Changes to BRL.Stream (1.01) *****

+ Moved '\' to '/' kludge from OpenStream to CStream which should fix '\' in Incbins failing and will have absolutely no other side effects whatsoever.


***** Changes to BRL.Pixmap (1.01) *****

+ Fixed RBGA/BGRA docs having same description.

+ fixed 'bddoc:' doc error hiding PixmapWidth/PixmapHeight docs.


***** Changes to BRL.Random (1.01) *****

+ Fixed Rand doc error.


***** Changes to BRL.System (1.01) *****

+ Fixed 64 bit Linux compile problem.

+ Fixed / extended extensions$ handling in RequestFile


***** Changes to BRL.BlitzGL (1.02) *****

+ Fixed 64 bit Linux compile problem.

+ Fixed Win32 windowed mode window size. This should fix a bunch of problems such as 'slightly off' MouseX/Mousey, GrabImage grabbing the title bar and probably more.

+ Fixed Win32 restore from fullscreen mode munting other window positions 


***** Changes to BRL.Max2D (1.03) *****

+ Added 'draw_last_pixel' to DrawLine (defaults to True).

+ Applied AutoMidHandle to images created with CreateImage.

+ Added ImagesCollide and ImagesCollide2 functions.


***** Changes to BRL.GLMax2D (1.02) *****

***** Changes to BRL.TGALoader (1.01) *****

+ Fixed endian issues for MacOS users.

+ Enlarged buffer for win32 mixer for SBLive users.

+ Increase fragment count from 2 to 3 for lowperformance Linux environments.

+ Fixed dynamic rate bug.


***** Changes to Pub.StdC (1.01) *****

+ Rewrote Win32 system_ to use spawn() instead of system(). system() seems to have problems with multiple 
quoted args, which plays havoc with 'spaced' filenames. Note: spawn() requires an 'extended' app name, eg:
'myapp.exe' not just 'myapp'. May fudge this at a later date.


***** New modules Pub.Lua (1.11) and Pub.LuaScript (1.11) *****

+ Thanks to Thomas Mayer for providing these modules.


-------------------------------

***** Changes to BRL.Blitz (1.01) *****

+ Tweaked StringFindLast.

+ Added Try/Catch around sample loaders to catch stream exceptions.

+ Fixed 'data' chunk not found if it didn't come first. Added check for compressed samples (not yet supported).


***** Changes to BRL.BMPLoader (1.01) ******

+ Fixed loader not skipping 256 color palette correctly bug.


***** Changes to BRL.BlitzGL (1.01) *****

+ Added better check for fullscreen creation failure. Note: Mac's which only support soft GL can only do windowed mode.


***** Changes to BRL.Max2D (1.02) *****

Ooooo look, its the "secret hush-hush club", I wonder what they're up to.  <br><br>As a dedicated blitz owner (Blitz3d, Blitzplus, etc) I feel as though I have been left out in the cold.   I refuse to buy a product I can't test regardless of where my loyalties are.  And thus far, all this silience has shown me that my hesitation to buy is probably the right thing to do.  No demos, no exes, no videos, no nothing.  Nothing to show that blitzmax is nothing more then an over-rated calc.exe.  No insight to the language (other then a mac demo that I have no way of running unless I go out and spend a grand on a mac).<br><br>Oh good, core release 1.05 is out, whats soo cool about this, now if I visit the beta forum, oh wait, i cant...  No wait, I can!  All I have to do is spend 100 bucks and I can find out whats going on..  Will it do what I need it to?  probably not, not at this point anyhow.  But 100 bucks buys my way into finding out..  Sad...<br><br>It's a great marketing strategy though.  It almost makes me want to stand out on the corner of my street with my hands cupped together.  As poeple walk by, I will peek into my hands..  When they look over, and ask what is in my hands I will request $50 before allowing them to see..  After they hand me 50, I will issue them a membership card and let them have a peek.  -Briliant!- <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Currently only the Mac version is offered for sale, but Blitz Research decided that there was no point in not offering the Linux/Windows Beta to already paying customers so they could determine whether BlitzMAX really did deliver on that whole cross-platform development thing.<br><br>I know a lot of Windows owners are pissed off that BRL decided to not primarily focus development on the Windows version, but it makes sense, when you're doing something innovative to developer for the better technology platform first, so you won't have to deal with (amoungst other things) that whole 1970's mindset that 4 CPU registers should be enough for everyone. The fact is that with the inferior technological platform on which Windows is executed, development simply takes longer. If you want to blame someone, blame Intel for not getting with the program, and blame Microsoft for being to reactive (as opposed to proactive, which we are fortunately seeing a shift towards).<br><br>Don't blame Blitz Research - it's out of their hands anyway. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
