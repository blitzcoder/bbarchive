One framework + multiple import = your binary only contains those specific modules, instead of the default 'just include everything in the pub.* and brl.* folders'<br><br><div class="quote"> 2.

Framework is not limited to one module. This is a fundamental point about how imports are viral in nature.<br><br>Open up the brl.basic module. It's in C:\Program Files\BlitzMax\mod\brl.mod\basic.mod if you installed BMax in the default directory.<br><br>It's nothing but a long line of import statements. This is how you structure a module if you want to use a whole bunch of modules with one framework command &amp; no additional imports. Imports, as I say, are viral in nature so importing them in one module makes them available from anywhere in the program. So you could actually type Framework brl.basic at the beginning of your program and have access to all of the modules contained within.<br><br>So if you want to set up a group of modules as a framework all of their own for you to use over and over, that's how you might go about it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
