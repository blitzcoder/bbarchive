On the other, so many people are trying so many things with the beta it could be an avalanche of feedback.<br>From the people I see posting there's quite a few talented coders who can work out the commands or workaround anything that seems to be missing. I AM worried about those people who will choose BlitzMax without programming experience (either blitz related or not).<br>Either they won't get past playing with any demo release or they'll buy it and be unhappy.<br>On yet another hand (that's 3 hands I think ;) maybe the sales of Bmx to experienced programmers/blitzers is enough.... maybe? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I don't really want to be 'experimenting' and wasting time on 'self discovery'(although I agree it can be fun). I want the product to say "These are the commands available to you and this is how you use them".<br>The blurb on the Blitzmax product page says...<br>"Easy to use 2D command set<br>BlitzMax includes the Max2D module which contains a set of very easy to use 2D commands. Max2D is based on OpenGL, allowing for advanced effects such as realtime blending, rotation and scaling".<br>... and I agree. The product looks fantastic and builds on B2D (which I also believe is fantastic).<br>BUT... how does a novice programmer pick-up this package and get programming without each command being documented <br>properly. *IF* there are plans to update the doc for Win32 release then OK. However if, as some believe, the existing doc is to be cleaned, then I don't think it will be adequate.<br>The way all the Blitzses have been packaged is very much like you suggest... "We'll give you the basics but you'll have to work the rest out for yourself or rely on the communities to do it for you". <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
