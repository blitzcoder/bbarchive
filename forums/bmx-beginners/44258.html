Maybe even some extras like a HUD, some auto-camera things, for instance, rather than writing your own camera code, it'd simply built in - unless you wanted something exceptional.  You could for instance, select a mario 64 style camera, and the camera would only move if it had to, and move smoothly at that.  For instance:<br><br>Types and constructors:<br><pre class=code>Type Camera Extends Entity
Type MarioCamera Extends Camera

Type MouseCamera Extends Camera
 Function Create:MouseCamera(smoothing#) 'Camera that you move around with the mouse
Type SplineCamera Extends Camera
 Function Create:SplineCamera(path:spline) 'follow a set of bezier or cubic curves :)
Type ThirdPersonCamera Extends Camera 
 Function Create:ThirdPersonCamera(target:Entity, distance#, angle#)</pre><br><br>Perhaps more...<br><br>Other game engine features could be stuff like a map format that holds emmitters, entitys, all that good stuff, and comes with an editor.<br><br>Oi, and imho, the 3d engine should be ooped, since a 3d engine is just plain asking for it.
