I understand Types and Functions quite well, but I've painted myself in a corner here:<br><br>My game has a 4x4 grid for 4 "players" that consist of a lot of variables and a 4x4 grid of "monsters" that have a ton of variables. I wrote a basic function that allows me to push 1-4 on the keyboard and focus my party members, but <br>I feel like its pretty dirty. It just mirrors their varibles as a "focused" variable as such:<br><br>If KeyHit(Key_1)<br>Focused.Health = Player1.Health<br>Focused.Attack = Player1.Attack<br>-add about 15 more variables worth of data here-<br>EndIf<br><br>If KeyHit(Key_2)<br>Focused.Health = Player2.Health<br>Focused.Attack = Player2.Attack<br>-add about 15 more variables worth of data here-<br>EndIf<br><br>So now that I've written all my functions, I'm probably going to have to do the same with up to 16 monsters, but...<br><br>I know there has to be a better way to make a type "fight" another dynamic type and then select in between them. This feels really "long way" and I can see it causing a few issues later... (also cluttering up the code vastly).<br>Essentially I need Player 2 to target Monster 8 and swap data. That sounds simple and I'm sure it is, but have yet to wrap my head around it. All my monsters extend from a Type with base stats as they should and they are created<br>semi-dynamically. I'd rather write my functions as "targtedmonsterhealth-100" instead of "if target = Monster8 then monster8health-100"... if that makes any sense.<br><br><br><br>Also I'm faced with a challenge of these grids. I really understand that a grid is an "array". My grid SHOULD be something like:<br><br> int_PlayerGrid : Int[4,4]<br> int_MonsterGrid : Int[4,4]<br><br>(now that I look maybe I should just write a 4x10 grid and leave the middle two rows covered up with block tiles?)<br><br>I'm struggling with the ability to use these dimensions as anything useful. The grid is a chessboard and people need to move and fight on it. Some attacks can hit more than one square and have ranges. I'm just really struggling with<br>targeting focus and giving the functions awareness to dimensional scope. (ie: a fireball could hit 2x2 based on its original target).<br><br>I did figure out how to kind of "emulate" this by storing the info in a varible with a psuedo position value (A1, A2, A3, A4, B1) etc, but it felt as sloppy as the above selection method and required my methods to check a lot more than I feel was nessicary.<br><br><br>So.. here I am. Ate up all my demo time and bought the thing :D<br><br><br>I was REALLY looking for some kind of game tutorial to build where I was making checkers or chess. All of these games and books I've read have you making some pretty basic concept games that are very "player" centric. I've yet to find a guide or tutorial on anything that shows you how to control a team of stuff fighting another team of stuff or anything that's a bit "i go you go", but I promise once I figure this all out , i WILL write one. Making a spaceship shooter<br>or breakout really isn't realitve to this project past displaying lives and score.<br><br>For now, I'd appreciate any advice people were willing to give. I'm not looking for code or handouts, just some pointers. After 10 years of music production I know when I'm at "banging head on desk-ask for help stage" is and "I could probably do this myself", and head has been on the desk for a couple days now.

Anyway, logic coding is one of my biggest challenges and sometimes it works really well for me and other times I have a hard time trying to have objects interact with each other. I am going to try to explain to you how I do it, not necessarily the best way but the way it works for me.<br><br>I usually create all of my objects extend from a base object everything that is going to interact with each other. an example would be as you have it:  baddies and player. My typical base entity looks something like this:<br><pre class=code>
Type Tpoint
	Field x:Float
	Field y:Float
End Type

Type Tentity
	'position
	Field position:TPoint
	
	' movement:
	Field movement:Tmovement
	
	' all of the entity's graphics representation
	Field animation:Tanimation
	
	Field activeWeapon:Tweapon
	Field weaponsPosetion:Tweapon[]
	
	'
	Field helth:Float
	Field damage:Float
	
	Method New()
		position = New Tpoint
	End Method
	
End Type
</pre><br>this is common to all objects and If I have a bullet that collides with an entity I pass the object to  a function that takes care of bullets colliding with an entity than I don't have to specify what type of entity it I pass to the collision function it will only check the common properties.  a little example:<br><br>lets say you have a type hero and a type Dragon:<br><br><pre class=code>
Type Thero Extends Tentity

	Function Create:Thero(image:TImage,x:Float,y:Float,spd:Float,dirx:Float,diry:Float)
		Local h:Thero = New Thero
		h.position.x = x
		h.position.y = y
		h.movement = Tlinear.Create(h.position,dirx,diry,speed)
		h.animation = Tanimation.Create(image,h.position,)
		h.activeWeapon = Tgun.Create(h.position)
		h.health = 100
		Return h
	End Function
	
	Method Update()
		movement.update()
		animation.update()
		weapon.update()	
	End Method
	
	Method Render()
		animation.Render()
		weapon.render()
	End Method
End Type
	

Type TDragon Extends Tentity
	
	Function Create:Tdragon(image:TImage,x:Float,y:Float)
		Local d:Tdragon = New Tdragon	
		d.position.x = x
		d.position.y = y
		d.movement = TSpline.create(d.position)
		d.animation = Tanimation.Create(image,h.position)
		h.activeWapon = Tclaw.Create(h.position)
		h.health = 20
		Return d
	End Function

	Method Update()
		movement.Update()
		animation.Update()
		weapon.update()
	End Method
	
	Method Render()
		animation.Render()
		weapon.Render()
	End Method

End Type
</pre><br><br>Then I want a bullet to interact with an object, all I have to do is pass the object to the bullet collision. The collision function would look something like this:<br><pre class=code>
Function bulletCollided:Int(bullet:TBullet,entity:Tentity)
	Local distancex = bullet.position.x - entity.position.x
	Local distancey = bullet.position.y - entity.position.y
	If Abs(distancex) &lt; 10 And Abs(distancey) &lt; 10 
		entity.health :- bullet.damage
		Return True
	EndIf
	Return False
End Function
</pre><br><br><br>Now if you want to check if a bulled collided with the dragon or the hero you can do this:<br><br><pre class=code>

If bulletCollided(bullet,Hero) = True
	If hero.health &lt;= 0
		'process death
	EndIf
EndIf	
	
If bulletCollided(bullet,Dragon) = True
	If Dragon.health &lt;= 0 
		'process death
	EndIf
EndIf
</pre><br><br>notice that the same collision function worked with the dragon and the hero.<br><br>I don't know how acquainted you are with polymorphism but that is what happening in the collision function. <br><br>if you want to be able to select an entity you don't have to copy every variable in the object to another object all you have to do is this:<br><br><pre class=code>
Field selectedEntity:Tentity

If KeyHit(Key_1)
	selectedEntity = dragon
ElseIf KeyHit(Key_2)
	selectedEntity = hero
EndIf
</pre><br>the above code doesn't copy the variables just assign the object to another variable so both variables have the same object <b>address</b>.<br>this way I can assign a dragon, hero1 or hero2 to the selected entity with out a problem and the collision can still be performed:<br><pre class=code>
   if bulletCollided(bullet,selectedEntity)
      if selectedEntity.health &lt;= 0 
         'process entity's death
     endif
</pre><br><br><br>this doesn't tie precisely to the previous and to answer your first question:<br><div class="quote">  <br><br>If KeyHit(Key_1)<br>Focused.Health = Player1.Health<br>Focused.Attack = Player1.Attack<br>-add about 15 more variables worth of data here-<br>EndIf<br><br>If KeyHit(Key_2)<br>Focused.Health = Player2.Health<br>Focused.Attack = Player2.Attack<br>-add about 15 more variables worth of data here-<br>EndIf<br> <br></div><br><br>you can do this instead:<br><pre class=code>

If KeyHit(Key_1)
	Focused = Player1
	-add about 15 more variables worth of data here-
EndIf

If KeyHit(Key_2)
	Focused = Player2
	-add about 15 more variables worth of data here-
EndIf
</pre><br><br>I am not saying this is the best as there are still other ways that can make the examples more OO.<br><br>I tried to do what I could and I hope you understand this but actually this is a topic for an OOP class or at least deep research.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font><br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I understand my concepts weren't very clear but you made perfect sense of what I needed help with.<br><br>I was close!.. Just needed the Entity aspect as a general target to aim stuff at. <br><br>I think I understand now and I was over thinking the "targeting" mechanism into it's own box (everything in AS2 was just it's own box). This ideal makes a lot more sense and it would actually allow me to pass data like "grid position" into and out of them easier.<br><br>The "bullet" thing is exactly what I was looking for too. My way works but  I knew it could be done easier. <br><br>As far as the "grid" mechanic I got something that's going to work now based on this knowledge..
