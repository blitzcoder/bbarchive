Swapping in/out as needed?<br><br>Q) What internally is happening when we code something like: MyImage:TImage = Null ? Is the internal surface created for that image also being destroyed to free up video memory? If it's not being destroyed, this could be a useful addition to the underlying graphics driver.<br><br>Obviously if there is no texture management going on under OpenGL, games that "only" load 32,64,128mb will be ok if they're running on a card that supports their vram requirements. But what if you want to code a game where each level loads a new background, sprites, animations, etc, etc. If nothing is getting destroyed or managed, is it safe to assume eventually performance will suffer? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you do GCCollect you are flushing the references and therefore deallocating any memory for objects which those references used - ie deleting textures from video ram. It's probably wise to force the GCCollect within the loop.<br><br>From what I remember, OpenGL has a system whereby you can say that textures have a priority level, and a state of whether the texture is `resident` ie stored in video ram. When you use too much space, it moves texture data to main memory temporarily. When you then need to use the texture to draw something it moves it back into video ram, perhaps forcing some other texture to be moved out. Moving stuff out/from to main memory majorly slows things down like doing a pixmap transfer.<br><br>OpenGL does handle that for you, from what I understood. That's why it gives you the commands to prioritize and manage residency of the textures. But blitzmax doesnt have commands to do that as such - you gotta make direct GL calls. If you don't make those calls, GL will decide for you which textures to move out as needed. Possibly DX has some kind of limit on how much virtual texture storage it can use before capping it and losing the data? I was playing with a GL texture thing a while ago and accidentally was creating new textures every frame, and after several frames I suddenly got a massive slowdown as it started to spool to ram. It didn't cause any errors in the execution of the program, suggesting the images still can be used, just slower.<br><br>So if you don't explicitly either detect and manage the amount of VRAM you use ie load no more texture/screen data than there is video ram for, and you don't destroy unused textures along the way, you are going to fill up video ram and overflow it into main memory and will experience slowdown (similar to when Windows switches to virtual memory on slower machines).<br><br>a) Yes<br>b) Slowdown when you store more than there is memory for<br>c) Resources are not destroyed until you garbage collect or explicitly remove the image <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Also I was careful in Fairway to make sure I only loaded about 32MB of textures into VRAM at any time to avoid texture swapping on low memory cards. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

What's confusing is, "store" is different from "render".<br><br>With DirectX you can safely take this approach: (If you want to.)<br><br>Load ALL of your graphics media at program start into TImages. This way you have "stored" all of your graphics into sram. And then when your program uses one of these Timages in your game loop, they are first moved into vram and rendered onto the screen. As long as the total space used by the "active timages in your render loop" is not greater than the space available in the graphics card, there should be no slow down.
