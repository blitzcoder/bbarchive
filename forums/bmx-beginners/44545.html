Seem to make 'em more fun, in part because there is a lot more happening on the screen.<br><br>Anyway, creating a good adventure game is definitely not for the faint of heart, there's a lot more to those than one might think up front. :-)<br><br>But the biggest hurdle in making any graphical adventure, is the magnitude of graphics work that would be required. In any good adventure, there are *tons* of graphics necesary for the background, countless variations of your sprites so they can move around and perform the tasks you need them to, etc.<br>There's a reason the big studies have dozens of people making the graphics for these kind of games. <br><br>Personally I started out with doing some google image searches to pull up some screenshots from existing adventure games, and used those as some placeholder graphics , so I had a typical 'scene', and worked on moving a character around in it, including some obstacles that were already in it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Really, at the moment the development is entirely dictated by what turns out to be possible, or not possible, so I don't have much of a plan. I finally got it working at a good framerate fullscreen (640x480) but I'm still dabbling with different extra steps and possibilities. Just playing around with ideas really, and trying to see how I could use it to make a game. It kind of has a life of its own so I'm just seeing where it leads me. I think eventually I will have to harness the effect and instead of letting it roam free, tie it down a bit maybe with some sort of elastic support structures or grouped objects, something like that. The main jist of the graphics technique is based on metaballs/blobby-objects, all done in the hardware GPU. It's fast enough but it does take some effort and I think it has potential to be something unique. I don't know how `big` of a game it could become, I guess we'll see how things pan out.<br><br>Overall I'm aiming towards more of a new-age/metaphysical theme, kind of electric and mystical in some way. Not sure yet whether I can have a static screen or some kind of scrolling engine - to scroll would be easy enough but collision detection is a big concern because everything is changing all the time. Hopefully it'll aim towards more than one player but probably waiting on some easy to use net module before it gets into networking. It's definitely looking cool so far (if I do say so myself) and I kinda got it to do what I originally intended, by mistake, which about sums up how early days this whole thing is yet. :-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Then analyzed the mask, and stored it in a lower resolution array of the same proportions.<br><br>(e.g. 800x600 image, 200x150 array)<br><br>If the mask was drawn, a cell was walkable, otherwise it wasn't. Then I used a standard A* pathfinder to find the most efficient way to find the destination point in the array, scaling the results to the real screen positions. The array was a smaller scale because walkmaps didn't need to be pixel-perfect, and the smaller size would be much faster to analyze.<br><br>As far as dead ends:<br><br>If there was no path to the destination point, it would take an imaginary straight line between the destination and the source point. Then jump back from the destination along that line at 10 pixel intervals or so (bigger steps on slow computers to cut down pathfinding time), and try to resolve a way from there to my character. As soon as one resolved, it would start walking from its origin to this point.<br><br>It makes the game look a lot smarter than not doing anything at all when you click on a dead end. (I guess you can do the same with your method, and move to the center point closest to your destination) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
