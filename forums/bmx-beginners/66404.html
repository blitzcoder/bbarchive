Blitz3D surfaces are a group of vertices and triangles which share the same material/visual properties. That is, the color, the texture(s) the shininess and anything else along those lines.<br><br>When you render your objects, you have to keep changing things are you render each object. You set a texture to render one object and then the next object might have a different texture, so have to set that texture instead. This is called a state change operation, and it's not particularly fast. Not as slow as it once was, but slow nonetheless. Blitz3d didn't let you choose how your objects were rendered. If you wrote your own renderer you'd sort by material properties and render such that the state changes were minimized. Keeping everything on one B3D surface meant that no state changes occured for that surface, and it was the nearest way anyone could find to speed up the renderer.<br><br>In theory, if B3D organized it's rendering properly, it wouldn't have mattered, but experiments with other methods ( copymesh or copyentity or something ) never quite yielded the same results.<br><br>Quite how that works in other engines will depend on the engine. But whatever engine you use, the more state changes, the slower it gets, so optimizing your render path such that the state changes are minimized ( and prioritizing them too, as some state changes are more expensive than others, and they all vary across all cards ( yes, it's really that hard to generalize ) ) is absolutely essiential to keep speed up. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
