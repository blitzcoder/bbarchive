After reading about delta timing and timesteps in <a href="http://gafferongames.com/game-physics/fix-your-timestep/" target="_blank">this article</a>, however, I've made a few mental alterations to this scheme to allow my rendering to be reduced to one simple, self-contained function, like this:<br><br><pre class=code>Type sprite
    Global list:TList
    
    Field x:Float,y:Float ' Coords
    Field w:Float,h:Float ' Width, Height
    Field r:Float ' Rotation
    Field a:Float ' Alpha
    Field image:Int,f:Int ' Image, Frame
    
    Method draw()
        SetTransform r,w,h
        SetAlpha a
        DrawImage image,x,y,f
    EndMethod
    
    Function render()
        For Local s:sprite = EachIn sprite.list
            s.draw()
        Next
    End Function
EndType</pre><br>The idea here - as yet untested - is that all logic is taken care of according to the timesteps, and then <b>sprite.render()</b> is called once to draw every single sprite on the screen, in a single pass. (This example currently disregards delta timing for the sake of simplicity.) This whole concept actually seems very similar to Blitz3D's entity system, where everything "exists" for as long as it's created, but is only drawn if it's onscreen and of course visible (<b>ShowEntity()</b> and <b>HideEntity()</b>).<br><br>Obviously, this brings one potential problem to the surface: drawing order. As it stands right now, all the sprites will be drawn in the order they were created in, and as objects come and go that of course will become an issue. The solution that comes to my mind is to add a z-order field:<br><br><pre class=code>Field z:Int</pre><br>Fine and dandy until it comes time to actually <i>sort</i> the objects. I know that lists and arrays can be sorted, but is there a way to sort a list of objects by one of the objects' fields? If not, how would I go about z-sorting these sprites? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Or alternatively if that's not what you want to be the generic comparison behaviour for all sprites in all contexts, just implement a function (not a method) that compares two sprites, and pass that in as the second argument to Sort. Comparison functions' behaviour (or Compare methods') should be as follows:<br><br><div class="quote"> Returns a value less than 0 if an object is less than another object, a value greater than 0 if an object is greater than another object or the value 0 if an object equals another object. <br></div><br>(Help Index -&gt; Language -&gt; Objects)<br><br><br>(Never used a function pointer before?

You only need to define the actions involved in <i>one</i> comparison operation.<br><br>This is part of the business of separating concerns. TList doesn't need to know that there is such a type as sprite, only that whatever it receives can be sorted in one way or another (it knows this because <i>all</i> objects inherit the basic comparison method from Object; or because you provided a function that implements that comparison mechanic). sprite meanwhile doesn't need to know how TLists are sorted, because that's an implementation detail of lists (and could be subject to change if BRL developed a more efficient sorting algorithm), only how to define an ordering relationship between any one sprite and any other sprite.

So when you see a type name used this way, it's the cast operation happening.<br><br>Casting is to do with type conversion. There are two main uses, one trivial and the other not so much.<br><br>First, the easy one: with "primitive" types, you can use it to convert one to another:<br><br><pre class=code>Local f:Float = 5.5
Print Int(F)</pre><br><br><br>For the more complicated use, you need to be comfortable with the notion of inheritance. When one type extends another, any instances of the extending type are <i>also</i> legitimate instances of the super type: they contain all of its fields and, their methods implement the same interface, so anywhere an instance of the super type could be used, an instance of the child type can be used also. i.e. OOP introduces the idea that <i>one value</i> may have <i>more than one</i> legitimate type (in the sense of "use context") in code. BlitzMax uses this as the basis for its implementation of polymorphism (the super type defines an interface, child types provide different implementations of the methods, multiple instances of the super type may therefore pack different behaviours for the same method selectors).<br><br>So while you can "upcast" implicitly - just assign a value of a child type to a variable of a super type, and there is no problem because we know the usage will be valid - "downcasting" (assignment of a value of super type to a variable of child type) requires an actual check to see if the new usage you're asking for is legitimate: it could be that the value is of a different child type; we don't know from its current usage.<br><br>All the cast operation does, then, is check whether the value given to it can be used in the context of the requested type: if so, it returns it, but the returned value is in the new context that the compiler recognises lets it be used as the requested type. If not, it returns nothing and expects you to handle this condition somehow (or to catch the ensuing null reference exception somewhere). The fact it returns nothing means you might sometimes see "If someType(someThing)" as a type check condition (don't use this if you can use polymorphism instead).<br><br>Note that also because it returns nothing on failure, the idiom "T(obj).meth()" is <i>not safe</i> unless you wrap your code in exception handlers, or you can prove at compile-time that it will never receive an object of the wrong type (i.e. that it's never exposed to an untrusted source of input) and is just being used to work around the type system. So don't use this in your Compare method unless it's never called from anywhere you can't predict.<br><br>(Note that because of this rather limited type system with no generics, BlitzMax lets you do things like build fully-polymorphic lists of completely unrelated objects. If someone made a list of sprites and also ...IDK, sounds... this would be entirely permitted; calling Sort on this list would result in some failed casts.)<br><br><br>Object could be anything, up to and including strings, arrays and streams. There is no guarantee that the second object being passed to Compare actually is another sprite, because the signature of the method allows any old thing to be passed in (having been set as Object by Object's default version). So you need to confirm that you're not trying to compare a sprite to an incoming network connection, before you go ahead and actually do it.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

    drawFrags()
EndFunction</pre>This would certainly WORK, but it's mediocre design; the function <b>render()</b> would have to be re-written according to each game it was used in, and therefore it would neither be modular nor universal. What if I made a game that had no game board? What if I had multiple types of frags/particles? What if some tokens had to be draw earlier in the loop, and others drawn later? By allowing z-sorting, I'm free of needing to worry about any of that beforehand:<br><br><pre class=code>Function render()
    sprite.zSort()
    For s:sprite = EachIn sprite.list
        s.draw()
    Next
EndFunction</pre>Clean, quick, and simple. The framework of <i>any</i> 2D game I make with this can be exactly the same; I never have to worry about the code inside <b>render()</b>, all I need to know is that I call it once per frame to draw everything correctly on screen. This is the nature of modular code: once a method or function has been completed, you should only ever have to <i>use</i> it, not alter or tailor it.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
