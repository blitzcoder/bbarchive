You can put my game under some kind of "do whatever the hell you want to" license.<br><br>And the "I should be at school thing" - I start at 1pm since I'm bunking heaps of subjects. Well actually I'm only meant to be in p.e. (WHICH SUCKS!) the other two slots are "study periods" (doing nothing periods as I would say). My dean said "I couldn't handle any more subjects" (the reason for the other two slots with nothing) which is a pretty daft statement, the extra subjects are crap like music, french, maori, drama etc anyway - just crap they throw in to "broaden your interests" which is just retarded. i.t. is broad enough for me, I would never do those extra subjects... ok maybe I should have been in cooking :) but still.<br><br>The school system is a load of crap anyway; they force you into p.e. and sex education and other garbage. And theres NO decent computing stuff you do there. I'm going to enrol in a hardware course for next year since its a good general i.t. skill that all computer peoples need to know. And I've been in and out of the subjects I've been bunking, but the specific teachers in those classes (p.e. &amp; english) didn't seem to like me, I had a world record in detentions until I started bunking those classes. Now I don't get any at all. Not that I'm really doing much in my current 2 classes except reading a book on pc hardware.<br><br>I always get told by girls, teachers and parents that "I'm wasting my life" - but what would they know? The ceo of telecom nz makes more money than the primeminister; but does she do any more work? Hell no! Telecom has a monopoly on the local loop and sucks money freely from the wallets of over 4000000 (4 million) people! She doesn't need to do anything! It just goes to show, you don't have to "be smart" you can just make good decisions or rip people off and get just as far as people who are educated (if not further and while robbing an entire nation in broad daylight!)<br><br>I often get criticised from saying I can still get somewhere without a proper education, then again I'm probably right – saying that I mean that I genuinely feel confident that i.t. is a realistic option for me, not just because I can shove it up the ass of careers staff at school :D I don’t know anyone in real life my age who has better knowledge than me with computer related subjects, and when you look at the amount of people who are unemployed or close to living on the streets... never mind.<br>--------------------------------<br><br>Anyway next time I post I’ll check if skidracer or leiden are online so I don’t need to write such a large explanation as to why I'm not at school... well it looks large on 800x600 anyway :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Not doing so says more about you to a wider range of potential employers than a few computer skills will say to the percentage who care about that sort of thing. I'm tempted to say it might be different if you were posting Linux device drivers, but I've a book about running (game) dev outfits sitting not five ft away from me and it actually has a little section dedicated to identifying people with certain attitudes and explaining why you should never employ them. (I'm inferring something there, BTW.)<br><br>It's not rocket science - an employer can take educated candidates and be fairly confident that they will soak up any new info and skills they require; If, on the other hand, you turn up for an interview with a proven track record of being resilient to education then what do you think the most <b>likely</b> outcome?<br><br>I bolded 'likely' there because it's the most important word. You might do just fine 'your way', but it isn't very likely*. By taking advantage of the educational opportunities you have, you can increase the likelihood of realising your goals... it's not necessarily an either/or situation with school on one side and your computer books on the other.<br><br>And Lordy, don't bunk off just because a certain teacher is down on you - you'll never see these people again once you graduate. Good luck, then, but be prepared for the worst (by which I mean having to study the stuff you're bunking after all... which, as a "worst" thing, really isn't that bad).<br><br>*I don't mean the hardware course is bad (on the contrary, it's great) but that the bunking (particularly of English given that you may end up having to document code) might mean talking yourself out of a hole later. For example the book I referred to (Game Architecture and Design - <i>A Rollings and D Morris</i>) warns employers away from candidates who have a problem with authority... an easy match for truancy. It's really not a bad idea to read up on what these people are wary of so you can paint yourself differently at interview (for courses as well as jobs). Have a look at <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/GuerrillaInterviewing3.html" target="_blank">Joel On Software</a> to get a feel for the mindset in operation (at the sharp end!) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

For me, the best part of college is finding like-minded people to date, be friends with, and yes, program games with.  When you get into the workforce and have a project you want to put together 3 programmers for, you'll have your roomate and his friend who were in that one CS course with you, and that girl you met at some party.  (Yes, girls do CS (although its like a 1:15 ratio here))  Similarly, when they have a computer project, they'll remember you.  A huge part of going to school has nothing to do with skills, its networking.  Think you learn anything super-special in business school?  You don't, but you meet your network and then when people have a job opening, you'll be in.  Sad but true.  Don't give up on other people, because you'll get passed over for alot of opportunities.<br><br>"I've had shocking incidents online where people have hugely misinterpreted my posts"  &lt;- time for more English class then :p That was a tongue in cheek statement, but seriously, read this essay by George Orwell, its excellent and covers about 3 years of  English classes in 15 pages.   here is the link:    <a href="http://whitewolf.newcastle.edu.au/words/authors/O/OrwellGeorge/essay/politicaandenglish.html" target="_blank">http://whitewolf.newcastle.edu.au/words/authors/O/OrwellGeorge/essay/politicaandenglish.html</a><br><br>Sex Education is the best bet to reduce teen pregnancy.  I don't know how it is in NZ, but in most places they don't teach you how to have sex - I'm pretty sure most people will happen upon how on their own anyway.  They teach people about the associated risks, and how to mitigate or avoid those risks, such as pregnancy.<br><br>You're not like the "retard" boys at your school, your a boy.  If I were to generalize and say all boys are retards, I'd be mistaken in your case.  This applies to girls as well.<br><br>Keep up the BlitzMax coding!<br><br>[disclaimer: I write badly 90% of the time, do as I say not as I do :p] <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
