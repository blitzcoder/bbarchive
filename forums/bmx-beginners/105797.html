I would work out my budget - what I am willing to spend on getting the project complete.  I would find a location or group of people who are likely to know the platform and language I wish to build for/in.  I would ask them if they could estimate how much time it would take to build such a project and get a few approximate ideas - is it a project that would take less than a day (8 hours) work, multiple days or longer than a week.  I would then estimate based on my budget and a few basic ideas about hourly rates whether I could afford to hire someone with preferences being for someone in the same city as myself so that we could discuss issues with the project easily.<br><br>If I could not find someone within my circle of friends, family, acquaintances who is willing to perform this work then and only then would I go online and check out the various freelance sites.  I would then post a specification of what was required and an estimated time frame and accept responses.  Should I find someone with good reviews, and a good track record I would then engage them with the possibility of being hired.<br><br>Once the supplier/coder is engaged it is useful depending on the size of the project to have a series of staged deliverables that can be checked off one at a time as the project is completed.  In some cases payment would be made at each stage, but there are innumerable ways of arranging payment methods.<br><br>That should provide some info.<br><br>Edit - as a rough guide to price however here is a sample of what you may possibly expect to see.<br><br>I wrote a game in 2015. It was 3d not 2d and fairly complex.  It was fully specified which took about 3 weeks to put the specification together.  Actual programming time took approximately 500 hours over a 6 month period.  There were a number of additional hours - about 50 - spent after release addressing issues, bugs and enhancements.  So total hours spent was 550 hours let us say.  Because I did it myself I didn't charge anyone for their time. But if I had been engaged to do it for a third party or a client I would have likely charged approximately $100AUD per hour to work on the code (in a variety of languages).  Rates would vary based on country, skill level and market value.  At that rate the cost to develop my game for the programming side alone would have cost approximately $55,000.  That gives a rough idea.  A simple 2D game would likely have cost less as the hours would most likely have been far reduced.<br><br>EDIT 2 - you may be considering going the Indian/Eastern European route to get a cheaper hourly rate for a developer - often this is a false economy as the language barrier, skill level and simply distances/multiple time zones involved can stretch out the length of time required to develop even a simple game massively. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
