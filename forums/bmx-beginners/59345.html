I wanted to get some opinions on which one people thought was better for 2D games.  I'm an experienced programmer, so the language (Basic vs. C++) thing is not a concern for me.  I been using Blitz3D and like it a lot. I didn't get very far with TGE (Torque Game Engine - the 3D one) because of the huge learning curve.   Cross-platform support (Windows and Mac) is important to me (and they both support that).  The built in editors in TGB seem like it might be a big plus, wherein BlitzMax you have to build your own or look for a third party one. However, my previous experience with the other Torque engine, would lean me back to BlitzMax  Thoughts?  What are the pros and cons of each. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So depending on what you want to do, that might effect your choice.<br><br>The tools with TGB really do make it seem like more of a whole product. However those tools are absolutely nessecary, where as with Max2D you can 'wing it' and still get decent results.<br><br>Since you know C++, one major advantage is that you'll be able to use TGB in your favorite IDE (where as BlitzMAX doesn't have much in the way of supporting 3rd party developer environments).<br><br>Lastly, for comparative licenses, TGB is 4 times as expensive.<br><br>Personally, I'd recommend BlitzMAX, but I am biased. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Actually it was like this:<br><br>TGB -&gt; C++ with popcap -&gt; Bmax<br><br>Reasons: speed, compatiblity and flexibility.<br><br>TGB is slower than both popcap and blitzmax by a considerable margin. Then you have popcap - very quick but its hardware acceleration isn't any faster than blitzmaxs' opengl, however it is faster at DX.<br><br>What swung it was Bmax provided much faster development times with a language thats fun to use as well. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But its worth the time as TGB is definitely an extremely powerfull and capable dev environment<br>- The license might be a problem for the big boys: You need to buy a commercial license if your publisher earns more than 250'000$ per year. (if you do that yourself, you will most likely be out of probs). you need as well to show the TGB logo at the start. *thats no prob to me, as I normally anyway credit things this way that helped me to do the job*<br>- At the moment, TGB is in a change from old Torque 2D 1.0.2 to TGB 1.1. This means that the level editor is comming in and some internal workings change completely. This is causing some headache at the moment (with the intermediate build that was not meant to go "user public" at first).<br>- Due to the point above, most tutorials on TDN are outdated for the moment, but will be ok again when 1.1 is out. (at the moment, they are mostly for beta1 not beta2 which introduced the leveleditor) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There have been other approaches here on the board for polygon collision but they all were not much <br>more performant than BMs PP collision. *the last approach was the one even skid posted. Was the "BM PP is so slow" "comparision test"*<br><br>I know that BMs PP is quite fast, but PP lacks two elemental part: early drop &amp; optimation for statically combined sprites (tile layers for example).<br>When you test pixelperfect, you can't say after 2 steps that they don't collide (unless their bounding boxes do not even intersect), you need to test all pixels. Polygoncollision through SAT for example does not need to test everything.<br><br>This is very important in 2 scenarios (at least from my point of view):<br><br>1. Large sprites (not that much of a problem to me so far as Kamaya is able to split images up and handle them like 1)<br><br>2. Tilemaps! Here it is a serious problem because it must test the whole "underground" in a sidescroller for example which are a lot pixels, while it is possible to optimize the polygons to reduce it to much less tests. (thats wherefor Kamaya will use it beside physics)<br><br>But thats ok to me. Its just another feature that might make Kamaya more interesting to potential costumers, isn't it? :-)<br><br><br>But I'm getting off topic.<br>To come back to topic: TGB (especially since Beta 2) and BM have both their strengths and weaknesses.<br>Thats why I use both and will be using both in future as well, both for their specific tasks and where they have their strengths.<br><br>I would all, that are interested TGB, suggest that they wait until 1.1 is done with the new editors and the new stuff on the page.<br>At the moment half of them are broken as everything *beside GUI editor* is moved into the level editor. Thus the informations aren't always up to date and the new examples aren't online as well outside the beta. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
