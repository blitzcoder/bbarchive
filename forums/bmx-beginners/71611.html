Creating and destroying type instances in the loop is fine, in fact this is the best way for spawning and killing monsters, bullets etc as you need them. Of course, your type declarations should be outside this loop, although even this may not matter, but it would not be good coding style. I wouldn't bother with a big case/select for room in your loop. When a new room is entered, call a 'new room' function that creates all the creatures etc for the room, then your main loop can be generic, just updating all the objects you have.<br><br>No glaring errors in what I can see above. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Basicly, the room data such as buttons and menu would be types so I doubt I'll store them in a file for now.

Let me tell you about how I see things right now:<br><br>I've been told to declare everything before loops so at first I thought if that's so, should I make a loop for every room and so declare everything before those loops.<br><br>Then I tried and it didn't work so well. So i thought of another way:<br><br>I though I would separate my rooms in the loop with a select case statements like ROOM_ID = 0,1,2,3... ect case 0, case 1.. ect. And then to declare my stuff.. since it's a loop and declaring should only be done once(so they say) then I need to make something that's only executed once in my loop code to declare the things I havent declared and after the room is past just destroying them.<br><br>Even that gave me problems, we I declare stuff, it says I haven't declared it when I did and stuff like that. Seems not to work quite accurately, /sob.<br><br>(as for keeping track of monster killed and wounded I though of using type.. but then again.. I guess that should stay in the memory uh lol, if I destroy everything after the room then it's not keeping track of them, I understand what you mean) <br><br>But what about not needing to keep track of buttons, textfields.. ect (which is a re-usable type I can use everywhere in my code thus not needing to retype any code) So I could destroy them to free some space but then when I re-enter the room I need to re-declare it so if not in the loop there's no way to redeclare it?<br><br>Overthinking my stuff :S<br>I appreciate the help Czar <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

(I am by no means an expert though!)<br><br>Have a room type to contain all the information you need. Then create an instance of each room and store them in an array. If you're not using a file to store them then hardcode them in a source file.<br><br>For example<br><pre class=code>
Local/Global/Whatever room:TRoom[roomNum] = New TRoom
For Local i:Int = 0 Until RoomNum
   room[i] = new TRoom
Next

room[0].name = "Room 1"
room[0].background = Image1
'etc. your monsters will probably be either a list or array
room[0].monsterNum = 3
room[0].monster = New TMonster[room[0].monsterNum]
For Local i:Int = 0 Until room[0].monsterNum
   room[0].monster[i] = New TMonster
Next
room[0].monster[0].health = 100
'and so on
</pre><br><br>This way is a bit wordy, which is where an editor program or making a way to load from a file can be helpful, but it should get the job done. I suggest you only prepare a room or 2 at first to test this way will work, rather than design your whole game only to discover this way doesn't work or something!<br><br>Then in your main game loop you'll have a current room variable pointing to one of the rooms stored in data. I'll call this thisRoom:TRoom.<br><br>Now you simply say thisRoom = room[0] to set that to the current room, or thisRoom = room[1] for the second room.<br><br>Now instead of having a separate case for each room, you can write a generalised loop for any room. Yay!<br><br>So to draw monsters, you'd put this in a loop (or make it into a method to call from the loop)<br><br><pre class=code>
For Local I:Int = 0 Until thisRoom.monsterNum
   thisRoom.monster[i].draw()
   thisRoom.monster[i].updateOrSomething()
Next
</pre><br><br>Or a cleverer way<br><br><pre class=code>
For Local tempMonster:TMonster = EachIn thisRoom.monster
   tempMonster.draw()
   tempMonster.updateOrSomething()
Next
</pre><br><br>Persumably your rooms will consist of doors to other rooms. In that case you'll want an array of doors for each room, and each doorhaving a value to which room it leads. So changing room is as easy as this:<br><br><pre class=code>
'assuming doors are stored as a type with fields for
'destination, keys etc
Method openDoor()
  thisRoom = room[destination] 'could be say 5, assumes your room list and thisRoom are global
End Method

'in your main loop
If thisRoom.door[whichDoor].unlocked = True
   thisRoom.door[whichDoor].openDoor()
End If
