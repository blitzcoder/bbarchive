Its been years since I've had to do any code and damn but I'm rusty. I've always learned better by doing but when I get around to my game I'll do a design doco first - hopefully so I don't make rookie mistakes like the ones you guys have helped me with. Once I get to that point I'll need to track down a competent artist (although I've been looking into programmer art and procedural generation and it looks interesting).<br><br>Thanks a lot everyone, you've all helped a lot... I've already made some changes and have added in a 'square' that I convert to a pixmap then move around on top of a scrolling 'starfield'. I'm hoping to add in some collision logic and background music today. The only issue is I get 'tearing' in windowed mode of the starfield, I figure its probably better to create the starfield, covert the whole thing to a tiled background, then scroll it... so more stuff to learn :)<br><br>Although first I think I might go back through the code and make some changes to my Types to make them a little more flexible based on jsp's feedback. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Thanks for the help guys.<br><br>@Plash: Spaces are an old habit from my uni days when the professors would hammer into us how TABs rendering on different systems cannot be assumed to be consistent while spaces could, we'd lose marks on assignments if we used TABs for indenting. <br><br>Mind you now that I've tried it I've noticed that the MaxIDE keeps my indent level if I return after using them (it doesn't for spaces) so this is another huge plus for using TABs for indenting... now I just have to break those years of training.<br><br>@Sledge: Good call on the variable name for sf, spent so much time on all the others and that one slipped through :(<br><br>I like the relative positioning version for scrolling the stars you used. I'm updating as we speak. <br><br>And thanks for letting me know how problematic the tilemapping would be, I thought that it would save on processing if there was only 3 or so image objects to handle, but now I've stopped to think about it I realise how silly it is to try optimise this much. <br><br>Yes they are animated - basic at the moment (sinlge layer scroll with varying speeds) but I've created a larger 'star' version and want to play around with kind of a 'twinkling' effect as they scroll - so rather than keeping them as points to Plot I've converted them to Pixmaps and I'll do a variable speed 3 stage animation as they 'grow' and 'shrink' by a couple of pixels while keeping their relative positions. It'd be nice if I could apply opacity levels on a per pixel basis - but I've not seen an easy command to do that and I'm not sure how to do that on my own via code... yet! I'm thinking 3 layers at the end, with the back going slowest and only being 1 pixel while the top moves fastest and has the largest 'growth' animation.

I agree with you on the loop variable, my later versions have removed this (it was actually more like lazyness than concern for optimisation that saw me place it there - you know declare once then use anywhere - I've since slapped myself and I'm back to being more careful).<br><br>Yeah the capitalisation thing worries me - only because I'm used to coding in languages where case is important and with BlitzMax it's not. In general the method I'm used to (but still having trouble sticking to) is to use camel case, with lower case starts for all variables, all upper case for constants and starting with upper case for Types/classes. Not having had to deal with globals previously I'm uncertain as to whether I need to differentiate them from local or field variables - it would be nice if the BlitzMax IDE tracked variables in the code panel as well as the types and functions. I would also usually use lower case starts for function names - but the BlitzMax style capitalises all keywords and included functions so I've tried to do the same thing.<br><br>I do generally find ordering my functions/methods to be handy too - but I tend to group them more by function (eg: all the getter/setter calls together and all the draw functions together). But I generally try to keep my classes/types small so they are easily scanned through... which means I agree whole heartedly with your separate files for types. I'm a java coder from way back and I'm used to that methodology and it makes sense to me. I just wasn't sure it was a good idea with BlitzMax, so thank you for that. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

With new compilers its hard to know what it does and doesn't respond well to - or what potential issues I'm leaving myself open to by doing something one way over another.<br><br>I pretty much agree wholeheartedly with your variable naming convention - it's what I'm used to.

</pre><br><br>For global variables in generale i don't have a fixed "rule"<br><br>Local variables in a function/method are variable that are deleted from the stack when the function call ends.<br><br>For starcount variable, it's the same. I like using length field for arrays because using a different variable for the same thing introduce a bit of redundancy. In C you don't know array size so you had to remember it with variables, bmax lets you know with length field or with Len() function. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But what is actually happening behind the scenes? Is it a case of one version being 'overwritten' or something else?<br><br>In some of the game programming books I've read (ages ago) for C/C++ they  recommended using a lot of global variables and then using functions to change/access them directly rather than passing by value/reference to a function - due to impacts of pushing/removing from the stack... is this still considered good practice? Or has processor speed and available memory (especially with BlitzMax 2D programming) rendered the need for using this 'dangerous' practice unnecessary? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
