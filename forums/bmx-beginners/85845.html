I taught myself blitz max over about a months time by trial and error with a few online tutorials I could find and the quick help button.  It was certainly the fastest I have ever learned a language, but knowing b3d syntax helped.  The major differences are the oo programming, ie, methods, reflection, functions in types, lists, threads, and some things like pixmaps and open gl support that allow it to be both flexible and cross-platform.  It also has some nice free 3d engines that offer b3d like syntax for bmax like minib3d, although I dont use any at the moment. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Blitz3D is to BlitzMAX what what WIMP is to a CLI. It makes simple tasks easier, and complex tasks impossible. So provided your game game be broken down to a series of non-overlapping simple tasks, Blitz3D is just fine. Otherwise you have to go with something else.<br><br><div class="quote"> Is the syntax a lot like B3D or has it some major differences that I should consider? <br></div>The syntax is practically identical. The main difference is the paradigm shift from procedural to object oriented. If you're an accomplished procedural programmer, this transition might be a hurdle. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

(commercial)<br><br>There's a dozen or so different 3D engines that work with BlitzMax, of varying degrees of complexity and features. Since BlitzMax is so modular, anyone can create their own module and add things to the command set.<br><br>Personally I only create 2D applications, and BlitzMax is amazing for that: since it uses 2D-in-3D, you get the benefits of 3D accelerated alphablending, scaling, rotating, etc... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The reason Blitz3D is less suited for complex games is because it lacks abstraction, not that it lacks features. It's a matter of language features, not engine features.

Lets say you have a type and that type is "object" all "object" types have the same fields, lets say all objects are either "good" or "bad" we can then add all "good" objects to a list, "bad" objects to a list, and "all" objects to a list. With a For loop we can then go through a specific list referencing either each "good" "bad" or all objects. vs B3D where you can only loop through an entirety of each type.<br><br>Other advantages... you can pretty much do anything with it, GUI apps, your choice of a 3d engine, tis a nice language <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There are tests floating around the forums, anyway) and you have access to a larger number of low-level programming features that were absent from Blitz3D - pointers (including function pointers, which opens up whole new worlds of possibility), better type and array systems, directly importing C code or assembly, static variables, nested functions...<br><br>You can ignore the OO elements until you need them and just use procedural programming if you want (or <a href="/posts.php?topic=81097" target="_blank">functional programming</a>, if you're particularly awesome).
