And generally you can't just turn it on and off so you have to accept the hassles up front if you want to use it. Further, lots of stuff (such as drawing graphics) is not (generally) safe in anything but the main thread, so you have to do some research before you start firing off threads. And lastly, as illustrated by the previous sentence. There are very few finite things in threading, there's usually a way around the a problem, it's just probably going to make you crazy. Just a little disclaimer really :0)<br><br>Point 2: threading doesn't work like normal linear execution.<br>The point of multi threading is that one thing can be happening on one thread (say loading a picture) while something else is happening on another thread (say drawing the pictures you've already loaded). As a result your program should optimally never wait for a thread (unless the thread HAS to be completed before you can progress... in which case you have to ask if it needed to be a thread in the first place... see paragraph one re: hassles...). You can't think of a thread as a function that you call, and wait for a response. But rather an assistant that you give a task to. You can periodically check if the thread is done, and see what the result was, but that leads you back to linear flow and you can probably spend that "are you done yet?" time better somewhere else.<br><br>Here's a little (UNTESTED!) example of a threaded load. Expect problems but hopefully it will give you an idea of what I'm on about...<br><pre class=code>

If you can blend resource management into the background you can make a much more immersive experience.<br><br>Another great use is an extension of the previous. Real time resource management becomes much easier when you don't have to write your own custom loading routines, just do your loading invisibly. This is the kind of thing that allows open world games and the like to function.<br><br>And then there's the yet more complex concept of threaded processing where you actually offload some of your processing tasks to other thread(s) (say your enemy AI, or physics calculations). Much harder to pull off but this lets you maximize modern hardware and leverage that extra processing power for more detail which in theory should translate through proper design to a better/more believable experience.<br><br>All of that said Czar and ImaginaryHuman have a very good point. Just because you can offload doesn't mean you shouldn't still optimize. Better use of your resources should always be a focus. Additionally multithreading even gives you a better return on that investment since you have even more you can do with that saved time.<br><br>And finally just a reminder, threading is a PITA! Balancing your development time and resources is crucial to any project. Before embarking on threads consider the added development and testing time. It might make more sense to stick to a single thread and just make a pretty loading screen, especially if it's at a logical break (between levels...) and doesn't take too long on a modern system. Also bear in mind each thread will compete with every other process/thread on it's core. Adding threads only adds processing cycles to your game if there are enough resources available to handle it. If you're running at 90% usage of a single core system already another thread is going to make things worse not better. If you're targeting multicore, or you have wiggle room above your current usage then you've got room to play. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
