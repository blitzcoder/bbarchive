I only got to mess with it for a couple of weeks, then got too busy to really check it out.  Since then, I have completely switched over to linux as my preferred operating system (from Windows) and even done a fair amount of Open Source programming in the last few years.<br><br>About a week ago i had the idea to make a new photobooth software to help my wife in her photography business. The currently available photobooth applications are either lacking in features, don't support linux or are way too expensive ($600 for Photoboof, give me a break!)!<br><br>Long story short, in just a weeks time, I have re-installed BlitzMax, learned the language somewhat and built an awesome photobooth application in my spare time (that is currently working in Linux and Windows! If I ever get my hands on a Mac, I may add support for it as well) and even have it running multi-threaded (as an option)!  I wouldn't have been able to accomplish 1/10 of this in such a short amount of time using c/c++!  And I've absolutely grown to love the language syntax (its so readable) of BMax! (i'm missing function overloading a bit, but I'll get used to it!)<br><br>Why anyone would choose another language over BlitzMax for their work is beyond me! Kudos to Mark for such a great accomplishment! I'm hooked! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Luckily, most of BMax its self has its source available, so reading back through hasn't been any more painful than what I've been used to! And as most of you know, once you know a couple of languages, its just a matter of taking into account the different syntax, so learning BMax was practically overnight! (it really helped having intuitive syntax and commands though)<br><br>Blitz Research should put up an official wiki page so us users can update it (I see that someone started a wiki some time ago, but it is no longer there. All the ore reason that Blitz Research should provide the wiki page!) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It would need to be incorporated with this site, and setup so that only registered members can contribute (to prevent spam).<br><br>The online manuals with commenting ability go some of the way towards this, but need to allow new commands and sections to be added. They also need to be more heavily moderated to allow pointless posts to be removed (which would mean more community moderators would be needed, with a good permission system to manage their access levels). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That was written by the same guys - Red When Excited - who did that version of the IDE.<br><br>A lot of people ditched Amos for Blitz back then as it had a major feature and cover disk support together with a big competition via Amiga Format around 1995 as I recall. It's certainly when I first came across it.
