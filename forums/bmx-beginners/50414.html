I thought that the "Global t:Timage=LoadImage( t )" line in InitializeSprites() would create a global image named hero from the file sprites/hero.png, but it doesn't seem to be working.  Actually, I'm not even sure if variables in Blitz are meant to be mangled in this way.  I'm coming fresh out of learning Flash AS, so if this business of dynamically naming variables is insane, tell me.  On the other hand, if you can think of a way to make it work, please do explain it to me.  <br><br>Basically, I'd like to create a sprite type, subtype it into variaout other types of entities that have more variables, and treat the graphic tied to any one instance of the type as just another arbitrary vriable that can be set and changed on the fly during runtime.  The uncompilable code above is one way of attempting it.  <br><br>As you can tell, I really don't have a firm grasp of BlitzMax yet.  You can link me to tutorials all day, but I won't really "get it" until I see working solutions to visual problems.  Abstract examples don't usually illustrate enough to me.  I need to see what works and what doesn't, and when something doesn't work, I need to be able to post my erroneous code and ask WHY it didn't work.  Only after several such explainations, I'm afraid, will I start to genuinely understand Blitz's syntax and the proper way to use these commands.  <br><br>Thanks, in advance, to anyone who helps me through this burn-in phase. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I know its a bit of struggle to get to grips with new languages sometimes ( though as you learn more languages you will find new ones get easier to get to grips with ).<br><br>The simple answer to you question above about how to write code to read a text file to get a variable name and value is that you cannot. <br><br>All the variables you use must be defined at compile time. The reason I used an array for the enemy images was so that the loadImages function could be written to use a text file to get the list of images to load into each one. <br><br>If you *really* want the text file to supply a name for each image I guess you could create a new namedImage type which will contain a TImage field and a name string. You could then have a TList of namedImage. Whenever you wanted to reference a *named* image you would seaqrch the TList to find the matching name. <br><br>Hope that makes sense.

I had simmilar issues when I was learning Flash... I wanted to make objects for whom the graphics were a variable, and in Flash it doesn't quite work that way.<br>Code is attached to movieClips in Flash, not the other way around.  I eventually found a way to fake it, though, which I guess is what you're suggesting with a namedImage type.<br><br>No pressure or anything, but if you have time to mess with it, I would love to see your implementation of the solution you're proposing.  TList and TImage are both new to me, and when I try to use them, I always seem to generate hairy compile-time errors, because I'm getting the syntax wrong or trying to use the keyword incorrectly or whatever.  <br><br>I know I'll get my bearings eventually, and I should probabaly just be patient and make simpler games until then, but this kind of modularity is something I want to learn early, as soon as possible, so I can use it in all games I make. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I extended to original code to have a new type ImageList.

I was just going back through your previous posts... you were thinking of having the simplest sprite stationary and that it will not need an update function.

For example you might want to have an animated image and the update will cycle through the images.. or it might do perhaps explode after a certain length of time. Of course if it doesnt move the xmove, ymove are not really required so you might have a typeSprite that doesnt have these.

Using your technique, I can subclass a different type of enemy and add new behaviors and whatnot in a method unique to that enemy!
