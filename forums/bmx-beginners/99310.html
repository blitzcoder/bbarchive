I'm diving in with the classic <a href="http://www.truplo.com/docs/BeginnersGuideToBlitzMax10.pdf" target="_blank">Beginner's Guide to BlitzMax</a>, and currently getting comfy with the new OO style.<br><br>Here's the thing, though. Because of that, I'm finding that many of the conventions I was taught for Java are bleeding in, and I'm now questioning whether it's really necessary. For instance, I'm doing things like this:<br><br><pre class=code>Type ball
    Field x:Float,y:Float
    Field speed:Float
    
    Method moveBall:Int()
        setX(getX() + getSpeed())
        setY(getY() + getSpeed())
        Return
    End Method
    
    Method getX:Float() Return x End Method
    Method setX:Int(newX:Float) x = newX Return; End Method
    
    Method getY:Float() Return y End Method
    Method setY:Int(newY:Float) y = newY Return; End Method
    
    Method getSpeed:Float() Return speed End Method
End Type</pre><br>As you can see, this is a bit verbose, but explicit and the very strictest of strict. I'm declaring the type of <i>every</i> function and method, even those which don't actually have to return anything, and I'm also using <b>Return</b> in all functions and methods rather than allowing the code to "fall out." I'm also using the long, command-like type declarations of <b>Float</b> and <b>Int</b> and so on, rather than using their respective shortcuts. In addition to that, I'm keeping all the custom type fields "private" by using <b>get()</b> and <b>set()</b> methods to access and alter them.<br><br>Obviously, this isn't absolutely necessary in Max; the above code could quite easily be written as this:<br><br><pre class=code>Type ball
    Field x#,y#
    Field speed#
    
    Method moveBall()
        x = x + speed
        y = y + speed
    End Method
End Type</pre><br>Bob's yer uncle, eight lines to do the work of fourteen, a lot less typing even on the lines that DO remain, and it's still 100% strict Max-wise. (I always code with <b>SuperStrict</b> anyway, best to learn where the innermost rules lie.) So my consideration is this: while the "Java-style" Max coding is definitely the most conventional according to "better" coding practices, much more explicit, and indeed more familiar to me nowadays... Is it really productive here? Or am I just putting myself through unnecessary hoops out of habit? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Or am I just putting myself through unnecessary hoops out of habit? <br></div><br><br>The short answer is that the state of the art in PL design has yet to answer this question, so all answers are subjective.<br><br>My own opinion?<br><br>1) If you're going to use pseudo-properties (get'n'set methods), I'm pretty sure <a href="http://www.blide.org/" target="_blank">you can use BLIde</a> to automatically generate these for you. This will at least save you some keystrokes.<br><br>2) Decide how important it actually is for something to be public or private, and make it one or the other. Most classes can afford to be fully public: there's simply no practical point in locking down fields that are either safe to modify directly, or that only you are ever going to see. Those that are intended for export and may need some regulation, you should lock down "properly" by removing the fields and property implementations to a private implementation class that extends the public abstract interface. Simply because there's nothing more pointless than properties on a class that can be modified directly by any old idiot.<br><br>3) Remember that BlitzMax is not Java. This isn't a trivial point: Java is intended and designed for the enterprise environment, where teams of dozens or hundreds of people work on a "live" project, without necessarily communicating fully, swapping classes in and out and hoping nothing breaks, etc.<br><br>BlitzMax is intended and designed for the indie environment: it is assumed that one person has total control of a project, and can read and understand the whole of their project's code. So BlitzMax provides some safety measures, but on the whole assumes that if "stupid" things are happening, it's because you have enough of a complete understanding of the code that they're probably intentional (e.g. 100% of things involving Byte Ptr).<br><br>4) BlitzMax's compiler doesn't inline any functions, even trivially small ones. Accessor methods therefore have a small but measurable performance impact. You may want to avoid them in tight loops and other important places.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

They take a lot of typing and maintenance for very little gain in BMax (ie, no one is forced to use them even if you code them due to the lack of private fields or functions.)<br><br>I absolutely do however, do what you did with the second moveBall function - accessing fields directly in the types own methods.  <br><br>I generally try to avoid manipulating fields outside of the type, so I guess I kind of do use setters, except I find a lot of fields change during other method calls rather than using dumb setters all the time.<br><br>I generally have no issues with reading type fields from outside the type, but treating them as read only (avoid the getter.)  If it's a complex call that may later require some degree of control over it, i'll provide a getter method but more often than not it's not a getter of a field name but more of a descriptive method..  ie I might have a field called "celcius:Double" and a method called "getCelciusTemperature".<br><br>In order to see a public/private interface of a type just be scanning the code I use an underscore prefix in any types that *shouldn't* be called by anything other than the type itself...<br><br>ie<br><pre class=code>
type Thing
  field x:Int
  field y:Int

  Method MoveThing()  ' treat this as a public method
  
  Method _scan() ' private method / func only for internal use

The objects data can then be also made "writeable" (default would be just readable).<br>As sometimes it is easier to access certain methods than a long "chain" we have also overwriteable parameters in Getters which fall back to default behaviour if not given.<br>This is only possible with Getters and Setters.<br><br><br>If you like the "Get(myvarname)"-approach you can use TMaps to store the variable (I mean an "StorageObject" knowing about the type and the value) in it - but that is not the niftiest approach to do so but mimics magic methods of PHP.<br><br><br>Although it may sound a bit "strange" but using Getters and Setters makes the code more manageable as the underlying "speed = speed - wind" can be done in "GetSpeed()" - and if no longer needed we just adjust the "GetSpeed()"-method instead of adjusting the calculation in different parts of the code.<br><br>Also getters/setters are able to restrict access by certain userobjects.
