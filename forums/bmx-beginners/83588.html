type MyGame extends TGameState
  field xpos:int

  method Render()
    drawtext "RRFW for teh win!", xpos,50
  endmethod

  method Update()
    xpos :+ 1
    if xpos &gt; 640 then xpos = 0
  endmethod
endtype
</pre><br><br>Put the graphics code in the Render() method and check for user input and update the game login inside Update(). The framework will take care of the rest. There is some small examples included, and some tutorials is being written. <br><br>Once you have your extended Type, it's as simple as doing this:<br><pre class=code>
Global game:MyGame = New MyGame 
rrAddGameState(game) 
rrEngineRun()
</pre><br><br>Some of you might wonder why you need to have a "state". Well, it will make things a bit easier for you down the road.<br>For example, once you have the game you might want to create a main menu. Put the logic and drawing commands for it in a different state, and start the game by adding it instead. Then in the Update function you can tell the framework to switch to your game state. Once the gamestate exits, the main menu will pick up and continue from where it left. Highscore table? Another state. Options? Could be yet another state if you doesn't want to mix it with the menu code. <br>And so on... They're there to help you out, and you are free to abuse them in any way you can imagine.<br><br>The framework will take care of the actual updating of the screen, and to make things smooth at all times, so you don't have to worry about it. And the framework let's you use a 1024x768 resolution on a 800x600 screen (if you would like that) or a 160x120 on a 2048xwhathaveyou for a more retro feel. There really is no limits to it and your game will look (mostly) the same no matter what resolution the user wants to run it in. <br><br>This is of course just a small example. There's more goodies inside. Send messages between objects in the game (zombieA tells zombieB that a player is in sight, or the player fired a gun and everyone that still has ears and can hear the shot will know where the player is)  or maybe you want to use the virtual gamepad? It will let you bind keys, mouse movements, youstick buttons or whatever and things will be a lot easier in the future if you decide that you might want to steer the car by moving the mouse and fire the torpedoes using a joystick button. <br>and much more. <br><br>Well, end of the rant. I hope I made people a bit more interested in it. It's open source so feel free to rip things out of it if you want, as long as you follow the license. (you can find it in the docs folder on the SVN) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

BFG would not have purchased the rights to the Grey Alien Framework if there was anything dodgy about it.<br><br>I'll tell you what's really going on here and what I've noticed about your behaviour when dealing with jake, Chroma.<br><br>When Jake first turned up here and started coding games and the framework you immediately tried to out do him. The fact that he made a match 3 Game which he sold didn't sit well with you so you attempted to make a Match 3 Engine and give the sourcecode free to all blitzers. This was your attempt to show Jake that you could do what he does and also give stuff away free where as he would charge. Your Match 3 code didn't quite make it though, did it? You abandoned it half way through when you realised that coding a proper working Match 3 Engine was not as easy as you first thought.<br><br>Then of course Jake started coding the framework. You had problems with this also. You then again tried to out do Jake by coding your own Framework to give free to the community. Again this didn't quite work out did it, chroma? You again abandoned this and then began your spate of trolling and attacking Jake for what he was doing.<br><br>Then there was a turn around. You realised your negative attitude towards him was just bouncing off him like bullets off Superman so you then went in to a** lick mode. You started with the "bro" stuff etc etc.<br><br>And here we are again with another turn around. Your back to trying to cause problems for him.<br><br>Here's something for you though Chroma.<br><br>Jake = BGF Employee, Fairway Solitaire, Holiday Bonus, Easter Bonus, Xmass Bonus,  The Wonderfull Wizard OF OZ, Unwell Mel, Top 10 many times on Portal Websites like BFG and has sold the Grey ALien Framework to BFG for a tidy some (all legit).<br><br>Chroma = Forum troll in threads regarding jake or where Jake is mentioned. Suffering from an obvious SUbconcious Jealousy regarding Jake and his success and frequently interupts threads with random accusations and Slander.<br><br>That's my take on it. I think what you need to do Chroma is take a chill pill, stop focusing your energy on Jake and focus your thought power on things that will help you achieve as others do.<br><br>Grasshopper. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
