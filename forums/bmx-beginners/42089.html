I wish to use several GOTO calls, to a selection of several routines that are organized by labels. For example:<br><br><pre class=code>
Goto Routine1
#BackToBeginning
End

#Routine1
'Add some program lines here
Goto Routine3

#Routine2
'Add some program lines here
Goto Routine 4

#Routine3
'Add some program lines here
Goto Routine 2

#Routine4
'Add some program lines here
Goto BackToBeginning
</pre><br><br>What I want to be able to do is, at runtime, change which labels are jumped to with each of the Goto's in each routine, so that the routines can run in a different order.<br><br>I was hoping that maybe you could use labels in the same way as function pointers so that you can dynamically change the pointers. ie something like this:<br><br><pre class=code>
FirstRoutine=Routine3
SecondRoutine=Routine2
ThirdRoutine=Routine4
FourthRoutine=BackToBeginning
Goto Routine1
#BackToBeginning
FirstRoutine=Routine4
FourthRoutine=Routine2
SecondRoutine=BackToBeginning2
Goto Routine1
#BackToBeginning2
End

#Routine1
'Add some program lines here
Goto FirstRoutine

#Routine2
'Add some program lines here
Goto SecondRoutine

#Routine3
'Add some program lines here
Goto ThirdRoutine

#Routine4
'Add some program lines here
Goto FourthRoutine
</pre><br><br>Will this work (any hope in h***?) ... and if not, is there a way to get this to work (efficiently and with the least code possible)? I need to be able to rearrange the order in which the routines are performed and this needs to NOT use functions - it must be GOTO's. ????????<br><br>Furthermore, would it then be possible to create an array or bank containing a list of the Label pointers so that they you can Goto Routine[i]? (or something like that)???<br><br>Thanks in advance. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

</textarea><br><br>This code is equivalent to what you're trying to accomplish with the Gotos.  Each label, in your example, now becomes a subclass of Functor with a procedural method, Run that does something.  Using a TList or Array you can organize the steps any way you like and can even quickly change their sequence at runtime with little overhead. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Well, the method idea is nice looking. I'm still getting used to this OO stuff but I do follow it (just). And I understand the linked list part. But the assembler programmer in me is making noise about how efficient this can be, surely handling linked lists, arrays and methods (and functions for that matter) is in general going to be slower than the Goto method.<br><br>I am basically saying to use Goto's because I need `program flow` to flow THROUGH several sections of code rather than all the wasted overhead of passing parameters and storing stuff on the stack and the extra math involved in using lists and arrays. This is for a VERY tight highly time-critical piece of code, perhaps THE most critical piece in the entire application, and needs to be very efficient.<br><br>I kinda felt that the dynamic labels probably wouldn't work unless Mr Sibly had built in some kind of function-pointer-like support for that.<br><br>As to using case-select, that's slow too, it has to do a bunch of comparisons just to decide where to go. I want this more hardwired so that program flow automatically flows to the right place without the compare operations. Also, I can't really write a select-case because I have no idea how many sections are going to be needed - it could be hundreds - I'm not going to have it go through hundreds of comparisons trying to find the right one to execute.<br><br>Maybe Mark could add a new type - label pointers, and allow us to do label arithmetic. It would help for jump-tables too. Then I could do something like:<br><br><pre class=code>
Goto Label[18]
' or
Goto Label[18]+12
</pre><br><br>I guess if BlitzMax also had linenumbers you could Goto a line number, then Goto would accept an expression like Goto jumpline (a variable containing the line number).<br><br>Any other ideas? I guess labels can't be changed at runtime due to the fact that they probably get remapped when the exe is loaded by the o/s depending on where in memory the app is stored, so they aren't fixed? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Rather than code something first in a given form and seek to optimize it later, I prefer to see exactly in my mind's eye how the system will work best and until that vision is complete I don't commit it to code. Then, writing the code is just a matter of committing it to paper. I see end results before they exist and just sit back to allow the rest (in the physical realm) to catch up, that's how my creativity works. For me the idea of creating a program and then looking at it and saying, hmm, I wonder if there's a better way to do that, is like saying "This program isn't born from a vision, it's born from a reaction". But that's just me. I am a creator, not a regurgitator.<br><br>Also, I'm fairly sure these other methods suggested will work, but I also know they aren't quite what I'm looking for. Maybe I should spill the beans on what I'm trying to do with this Goto stuff.<br><br>Imagine a Co-processor whose circuity can be reprogrammed by the user - these exist already in hardware. What I want to do is make an area of my software program that acts like a re-programmable circuit. By changing which labels are jumped to I would be able to `re-wire` the circuit. After it's been rewired, program flow goes through it in a sequential manner without any extra stacks or retuns from functions or if's or whatever else. That area of my software should, once set to a given state, act in a particular way as if it were almost hardcoded in that configuration. So yes, I could use functions or methods or whatever else, but I need to remove the if's, the gosubs, the functions, the methods, the case-selects and other such decision-making flow-diverting stuff, so I just end up with a fluid adjustable `circuit` that, when jumped to, performs whatever set of operations I've programmed it to do, at runtime. The only way I can see to do that, efficiently, is with Goto's, except as we know, maybe BlitzMax doesn't support what I'm trying to do. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
