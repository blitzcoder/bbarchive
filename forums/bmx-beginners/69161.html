SetBlend(ALPHABLEND)
SetAlpha 0

' Main Loop-------------------------------------------------

Repeat

' Functions-------------------------------------------------

	If FADEIN&lt;1
		FADEIN:+0.01
		SetAlpha FADEIN
	End If
End Function</pre><br><br>This works as expected, but relies on global variables again. I tried:<br><br><pre class=code>Function DRAWGAME()

		FADEIN:+0.01
		SetAlpha FADEIN

Personally I'd try keeping fadin as a global because it's just simpler that way.<br><br>Why the capitals? Traditionally only constants are in capitals. Although BMax isn't case-sensitive it doesn't matter, caps is just an odd style for variables and functions.<br><br>gamemode is a variable that could be local, as it is not used in any functions. You don't even need gamemode. Just make three repeat loops for each stage, using exit to get out.<br><br>Images can be made local variables and sent as parameters to functions. However for simple games it's not so important.<br><br>If you give some code of a more complete program it would be easier to see how you are using the variables. I think you might need to change your way of design.<br><br>Global variables are bad for two reasons. They encourage bad design, as you can end up with parts of the program depending upon other parts. Then if you change something, you could create errors spreading unexpectadly throughout the program. Secondly, they are slower to access than local variables (I've heard). But they use the same amount of memory.<br><br>Hope this helps. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Whether or not these are globals is not even relevant, the fact that you use named variables like these for this kind of stuff is equally limiting, namespace-wise.<br><br>What you *really* want is an animation system where you define animating... 'things', let's call them "entities" to stick a bit to Blitz. Each entity could have fields like these: (and I'll start simple, but I'll pull some strings later)<br>x<br>y<br>z<br>imagehandle<br>sound<br>rotatex<br>rotatey<br>rotatez<br>fadeinspeed<br>fadeoutspeed<br>alpha<br><br>etc.<br><br>What you then need to do is build up your titlescreen using these entities, meaning that you'll end up with this:<br><br>title:TAnimEntity=New TAnimEntity<br>title.x=5<br>title.rotatex=5<br>[..]<br><br>copyright:TAnimEntity=New TAnimEntity<br>copyright.alpha=.5<br>copyright.rotatey=45<br>[..]<br><br><br>By using this, the only variable you're really using is these entity names 'title', 'copyright', etc. With this you already wiped most of your initial vars.<br><br>So, I announced to pull some strings:<br><br>You don't want title:TAnimEntity and copyright:TAnimEntity at all, because with those names you're actually hardcoding something, and hardcoding sucks! You want an array of TAnimEntity's, and just fill it with all these entities, preferably using an external scriptfile.. perhaps XML even..<br><br>Why's that? With this array you can actually design your whole titlescreen outside your sourcecode using that scriptfile in notepad. Each entity the parser sees in your script reslices your array, and so your titlescreen with all its things can become really big -without bloating your code!-.<br><br>More strings to pull:<br><br>You don't want fadein and fadeout variables in your TAnimEntity type, as that's more or less hardcoding again. What you want is a TEnvelope, and readout an envelope-value based on a phase-index. This TEnvelope is a seperate object again which can be as complex as anything.. a simple attack, attack-decay, or decay.. but also a multisstage/segment envelope, or perhaps you could even use beziers to readout such a multistage/segment envelope. If you have this, this whole TEnvelope is *at once* perfectly suitable to move *anything*, and not just coordinates, but also alpha or soundvolume for all I care. Normally you'd have tons and tons of volumefadein, volumefadeout -like variables for all that, and fadein and fadeout are just mere attack-decay movements, nothing like the bezier-goodies you could have.<br><br>So, back to this TAnimEntity array.. from your whole list we just reduced it to one single array instance. Want to get rid of that one too? Make it a field in your TGame, and in the end, one game:TGame is everything you have!<br><br><br>The real problems here are not the difficulties of a game, but the opportunities and possibilities! Once you get the hang of it you keep studying possible futures and you keep splitting things up. Eventually the work will pay itself back, but until that time you'll have to accept that small-scope/oneshot procedural coders are running circles around you. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
