</pre><br><br>Clearly on Mac 1280 pixels wide OR HIGHER are the most common with only 0.8% using a 1024 width. That resolution is practically obsolete there since Mac's have been using widescreen displays pretty consistently for some years now. On Windows in general there are about 20-25% of the population who have an `underpowered` PC compared to general Mac specs, and those PC's tend to have lower resolution displays, poorer graphics cards, slower CPU's etc - and as the above shows, there's still around 20% of people using a resolution of 1024 pixels or less. But practically all of the remaining 80% are using a HIGHER resolution than that.<br><br>Resolutions of 1920 or higher are quite a niche still, though. Only about 15% on Mac even less on Windows. Keep in mind though there are like 10x as many Windows users so the percentages can be misleading. 20% of Windows users having a 1024 display is the equivalent to 200% of all Mac users!<br><br>I think it's a good idea to target HD graphics, as your base graphics, and then scale DOWN to support other resolutions. That way people with HD will really appreciate the extra crisp detail while the lower-res folks will still get decent images. You can't scale UP from 1024 with the same quality. It would probably be a mistake though to only target 1920 display resolutions as that cuts out 85% of your potential audience.<br><br>There is a trend on websites also in the past couple of years to move towards supporting 1280 as the new defacto minimum screen width, because 1024 has lost it's place as the standard. For the longest time site widths were around 1000 pixels but now they're moving more toward 1250 or so. But they have to also scale down to support 1024 because there is a big upsurge  of tablet users, especially iPad 1 and 2 which can account for over 20% of online shoppers now. The tablets are making 1024x768 resolution `come back into style` a bit, but it won't be for long.<br><br>If I were making this decision for a game I'd say make it at least work well on 1280x720 (since the height is a little less than 768) and let it scale down to 1024x768 without losing any major game elements. Then if you want, support higher resolutions also. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
