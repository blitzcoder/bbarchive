I love the entities, the camera classes etc.<br><br>I understand that I will be able to cross compile to 3 platforms. I also understand that I can OO classes. Well if I am going to have to learn OpenGL for doing my 3D and lose the ease of use of the Entities, Camera, etc, quite frankly I may as well go back to C++ and code in OpenGL, and get some skills that would be useful on my CV.<br><br>Or am I missing something?<br><br>BTW: before I get flamed (as I am sure I will, as somebody will not read my post properly), I think creating a new OO language which can compile on 3 platforms is a great achievement, well done Mark! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

For i = 0 to MaxStations
ProduceFinalProduct(ArrayStations(i))
Next
</pre><br>Where I can do this in BMax:<br><pre class=code>
For i = 0 to MaxStations
ArrayStations[i].ProduceFinalProduct()
Next
</pre><br>This will do the same, but in B3D, the function has to refer to that specific station (i) for each operation you do on the station, while in BMax it processes the type-instance itself directly, so the code will be much shorter (and maybe a bit faster).<br><br>As for the entities, camera classes and such, I think BMax will support them too in much the same way. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

My only concern (which is only temporary) is learning what makes OpenGL different from DirectX in Blitz coding, since it obviously changes the way I program entirely. I still use Blitz3D most of the time, because it has features I like, a lot of libraries and source code is widely available, and I'm just plain comfortable with the language and the program flow.<br><br>BlitzMax will take a bit of practice considering the major differences from the previous Blitz iterations, such as the expanded Types and learning which module this command or that command is located in. Lots of calls have to be made in the beginning of the source code when compared to Blitz3D source. Ahg, I'm rambling on when I should really be working at actually learning to use it properly. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
