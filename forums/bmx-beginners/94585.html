I'm a total Linux noob and I'd really appreciate some help with a few things:<br><br>1) What version of Linux should I install/use to test with BlitzMax?<br>2) I have Windows 7 and someone told me I could boot Linux from a CD and run it in RAM or something instead of having to put it on my drive, but is that practical?  Surely I'd need to re-install BMax (and any other dependencies) every time, so that we could dumb.  So if I dual boot my system (never done that before) is it really safe or could I blow up my win 7 partition (which is on a SSD drive btw, in case that makes any difference)?<br>3) What are the main pitfalls with getting a BMax game running?<br>4_ Obviously it uses OpenGL, but is there anything I need to detect/do?<br>5) Also what sound driver is best?  FreeAudio or something else?<br>6) What about the filesystem? Anything unusual, and where should shared data like player profiles, high scores and ini settings be stored?<br>7) Anything else?  Like is there a ctrl+alt+del (and other system key presses) equivalent that needs to be handled specially etc.<br><br><br>Huge thanks for any advice you can give me on these topics!<br><br>I want to get my framework working in Linux so I can release some of my older games (and new ones too of course) on Linux.  I already do good with Mac sales and want to try out Linux. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Should be restored when uninstalling it.<br><br>6) User settings are stored inside the /home/&lt;username&gt; directory. You're free to use any directory inside there you want, just make sure it isn't already being used. e.g. /home/&lt;username&gt;/my_ultimate_game Depending if you want to hide its contents prefix it with a dot. File attributes are important as well. Make sure the binary has the executable bit set (chmod +x).<br><br>7) ctrl + alt + del won't bring up a process manager like it does in Windows. I believe the desktop installations of Ubuntu are guarded for this, but at least in a console it'll reboot your machine. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The only downside is the default ide under linux is less than perfect, but since for the most part I suspect you will just be building the game rather than coding it on linux you can get by. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Why? No idea).<br><br>One thing I would point out is that the people on the Ubuntu forums are adamant that you <i>shouldn't</i> use Wubi for any kind of serious development. Wubi is explicitly intended as a toy; it's a trial-run that has better access to the hardware and should be more representative of a real installation. It also has lots of bugs because it's <i>not</i> a real installation, and they take great pains to point out it could break and cause data loss at any time.<br><br>I've also heard that it can damage your Windows installation if you get something wrong, because it exists on the same partition and thus can, in edge cases, affect Windows system files. You may actually be safer making a true partition and a full dual-boot, because then the systems will be completely isolated. (The biggest disadvantage of a true partition is that it overwrites the Windows bootloader, so getting rid of it again if you don't want it will require use of some Windows recovery tools.)<br><br>If your computer can boot from USB, the idea suggested by your friend isn't so stupid: you can use several different tools to either create a LiveUSB from a LiveCD (and then you can allocate some persistent storage for settings and a small number of files and applications), or install directly to the USB drive as you normally would. This has the huge advantage that as long as your computer is able to boot from it, you don't need to affect your Windows system in any way. However, if you use a flash drive instead of a hard disk you might run into problems with wearing it out (others say that even cheap flash drives have a longer lifespan than we expect).<br><br>Depending on what you need to do, I'd strongly recommend you consider a virtual machine to start off with. You won't have any problems with drivers, and you can run it over the top of Windows and share files and folders, or even work in two open applications side by side. The only real problem with this is support for graphics acceleration, which seems to vary; but in all other respects a VM is the closest thing you'll find to a Linux install that really does "just-work" out of the box.<br><br>(Another tip: when at the command line, your best friend is "man", which gives you documentation for a command. Use "man &lt;<i>command</i>&gt;" for <b>everything</b> and you will quickly start to pick up a lot of information. Press Q to leave the man screen - I was put off using man for a long time because I couldn't work out how to leave it without rebooting the machine.)<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But if those people were honest, they would admit that this 500 bucks machine does not even run the operating system really well that came pre-installed on it. And then try to "upgrade" that pre-installed OS to a newer version of Windows when it is released. You will probably find out that that won't work at all - because nobody has written the necessary drivers for that cheap, then old hardware.<br><br><div class="quote"> And believe me, I root for Linux! I really wish it was more successful and there was a decent 'desktop' market for it. But Linux market share is declining year after year, while Mac and Win are gaining ground. <br></div><br><br>That isn't really true. Microsoft has lost a fraction of its desktop share to Mac OS X while Linux more or less stagnated at its less than one percent desktop market share. (On the server, Linux has been gaining ground at the expense of traditional Unixes and Windows Server owns the other half of the market.) <br><br>But the real fact here is that desktop systems are on the decline in favor of mobile devices and game consoles. On mobile devices, its a whole different world: Currently, Android (which basically is yet another Linux distribution) and iOS (which basically is another BSD Unix) are ruling the market and everything else is insignificant in comparison. Windows Mobile is total no-show and even Nokia's old platform Symbian is more important than Microsoft.<br><br>What we can observe at the moment is that especially in the consumer market, tablets (also known as iPads) are eating the market share of notebook computers, which in turn have been eating the market share of desktop PCs over the last couple of years.<br><br>So the whole discussion which is the best or even a good desktop system is becoming increasingly irrelevant because your customers are moving on to new places: iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, Xbox 360, PS3, Android, WebOS, Bada. Or they don't care anymore at all because the "operating systems" that they actually care for are Mozilla Firefox, Google and Facebook - and none of these big names care for the desktop OS that their users are using.<br><br>So even trying to conquer desktop market share is a waste of time and resources, because the consumer(!) desktop PC is DEAD. Consumers are now using the web and mobile apps. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
