I was wondering, what if you want to break-up the loading of levels\menus on a larger game?<br>The way I would go about it in pseudo code is:<br><pre class=code>
while exit=0
  select level
     case 1
          load  level 1 stuff
          repeat
              level1 loop
          until level&lt;&gt;1 
     case 2
         load  level 2 stuff
         repeat
               level2 loop
         until level&lt;&gt;2
      ....and so on so forth
    end select
wend
</pre><br><br>This seems to work for me, but the garbage collector, doesn't seem to like it, as it doesn't seem to clear the memory when I move to another sub-loop, probably due to loading stuff while in the main loop.<br><br>Is there a way to force clear the memory? Should I structure my code differently, and if that's the case, how would I do it so that I don't need to load everything at once? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Basically the collector cleans it out whenever it feels good and ready. It could be a few seconds after the variable is nulled. You say that the memory doesn't clear, what method are you using to test this? If the memory isn't getting freed after the program quits, there is definately a problem. The garbage collector has been tested frequently by users on the forum and, apart from the case of circular references, it's watertight, so I wouldn't worry about it too much.<br><br>About your level selection structure, it might be better to have a generic LoadLevel function or method, which is given the number of the level to load. This way you don't need to repeat lots of common variable names and there'll be less work in adding new levels. It depends a lot on the type of game and how you are storing your data though. For example, let's say you have the map stored in a 2d grid 100x100, eg grid:Int[100, 100] (or replace Int with whatever type you need). Rather than having a seperate grid variable for each select..case, you now just need one that is updated by the LoadLevel. You could store is as a global variable, or as a field of a "Game" type or something.<br><br>Edit: You could try using these functions. GCMemAlloced() - returns memory used by all objects, strings and arrays in bytes. GCCollect() - tells the garbage collector to execute now. It returns the number of bytes freed. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So even if I return to menu1 the memory will keep adding up to gigabytes, until I terminate  the game.<br>I was thinking that maybe because each level\menu is created under the while\wend loop (see pseudo code on 1st post) the Garbage collector considers it still on scope and doesn't clear it.<br><br>Thanks for the suggestion on structuring. The problem is, each level is slightly different to the other, that's why I didn't take that route. Maybe I could write a function and add stuff selectively with if\then statements,<br>but I'm not sure if that's even more cumbersome.<br><br>Btw, sorry if I make really weird suggestions, I am self taught and really bad at understanding other people's code, I usually rely purely on my logic and I'm pretty sure I don't always end up with the optimal solutions to a problem. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

OK I'd really like to see some of your code to see just what you're storing that's so large :P Are they image files? Or just plain data?<br><br>I edited my post above at the same time you posted this one, with some garbage collector functions you might like to try.<br><br>It's a good idea to store your level format in files. It takes a bit of extra work to create and process the files, but lets you add new levels in the future without changing code, plus it keeps your code light if there is a lot of level data you are storing. If you have a naming standard, eg level 1 is stored in file "level1.dat", level 2 is "level2.dat" etc, then if LoadLevel takes an integer parameter level_number, it can open file "level" + level_num + ".dat" and get that level's unique data from the right file, with only one function.<br><br>Alternatively, you can keep the loading stuff in the code, but you should seperate them off into functions. For example, LoadLevel1(..), LoadLevel2(..). You can basically copy and paste the code from your case statements into the function. Pass any objects you need loading as parameters, and update them in the function. It could look something like this.<br><br><textarea class=codebox name="code" wrap=OFF readonly="true" rows="15" cols="80">Strict

This means if the memory is not being freed after leaving PlayLevel (and ordering a manual garbage collect, which ideally we shouldn't need to) then we have a big problem!<br><br>If you are not already, you should program using Strict or SuperStrict mode. I just realised this could <i>possibly</i> be the problem - in original mode, the code generated is less efficient.

Where do you know from it does not clear the objects? The process manager won't help you that gives you the size of the application pool, but not how much of that is used effectively at the time. The GC will not free the pool as that would be suicide (alloc and freeing of memory references to the OS is a very slow operation so the GC keeps a pool of unused memory if the system has memory free to allocate future object in a fast way - thats the base upon which managed environments build, otherwise they wouldn't work)<br><br>2. What happens if you strict the whole stuff. As mentioned, scoping and many other optimizations don't work without strict. BM basically "drops back to stupid mode" if you have not at least strict to allow (out of BM code view) slugish code to run at all <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
