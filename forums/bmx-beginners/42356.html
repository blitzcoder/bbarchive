The Traditional Blitz Model of POINT updates is now supereded by Module Synchronization.  A change in one module should have little or no effect on the overall stability of the language.  After just a week or so of playing with the OOP functionality, I have learned quite a bit and really look forward to more modular and manageable code. <br><br>Blitzbasic, Blitz3D and Blitzplus have a tremendous record of support and stability.<br><br>and, yes, While I don't consider them finished, the documentation is rather good. The BBDOCS system generates documentation when the Modules are synchronized.  It is up to the Module builder to make the docs clear and informative.  Many of them are excellent.  Mark's inro to OOP in the tutorial forum is top notch.<br><br>as more tutorials and documentation updates occur, we should have plenty of reference material to accomplish our goals.<br><br>Many of us are waiting for the 3D module.  I am already amazed by the 3D demos that have already been released in MAX.  The 3D modules should serve to simplify and streamline some of the complexities of 3D OpenGL.<br><br>I understand that some folks are dissatisfied with the complexity, lack of docs and other factors.  Some of them are attempting to port over an existing Blitz3D of BB project.  If you fall into this category, please try to consider MAX a seperate and distinguished language, not a 2.0 version of BB or B3D.  The syntax and overall scope of MAX is quite different than that of its predecessors.<br><br>Overall, I thoroughly enjoy learning this fantastic new language. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I was expecting it to be a lot more impressive than the extremely basic one we got. I mean alpha blending and realtime rotation and scaling are an improvement over BlitzPlus ( though not over B3d ) and that's pretty much as basic as the improvements could be, considering that OpenGL is all 3d accelerated anyway.

I think the BRL viewpoint is that Blitzmax is, at least initially, an upgrade over previous versions of Blitz in the following two areas:<br>1) Cross-platform-ness<br>2) Improved Language constructs / OOP<br>And it is these two things that they have decided to focus on.  Having reached a point where the core language and 2d engine are roughly equivalent to Blitz Basic, they have decided to release it <b>*on the Mac*</b>.<br><br>BlitzMax is not an upgraded 2d language compared to other versions because it isn't intended to be.  It isn't even officially released on PC yet  (it's beta!), so it's not entirely fair to compare them.<br><br>I'm not discounting your requests as invalid - I'm sure they'd be useful additions.  I'm just saying that they were never BRL's focal points during development, so it's not entirely surprising that they're not vastly different from what us as PC users already know. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

	Spaceship Movement tutorial--  Version 2 "A Little More OOP"
	In this episode I am incorporating some ideas and insights
	from fellow BlitzMAXers to make the code a little more OOPy.
	
	Significantly, We added a function called create that will act
	as sort of a "Spaceship Object Factory".  We also are using a
	LINKED LIST to hold our objects.
	
	Thanks to PERTURBIO for the key-binding and check controls methods as
	well as other OOP enhancements

	create an actor type that possess attributes that can be used by may different
	game characters. Player, enemy, Wizard, etc... 

	The Type "ACTOR" is the beginning of our Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
	Actor is a Class or Type.  It simply is a definition of what an "actor" is.
	the Fields can also called Attributes.  for example, an actor has the x#,y# 
	Fields that will hold the screen x,y coordinates that tell BMAX where to draw
	it.  the actor class also has "Methods". Methods are functions that are unique
	to that class.  the "update" method, for instance, will only work for the actor
	class.
	
	  	
End Rem

			 This method calculates the velocity of the ship as well as the 
			 angle. It uses the SINE and COSINE of the current ANGLE to

			 0 and 360. 
			 both velocities (rotation and forward) are multiplied by a friction
			amount that will slow the ship down each frame

	Now we create an extended Type called Player.  Type Player will INHERIT all of the
	attributes and methods of actor, as well as add a new field of its own, inventory.
	the [] at the end indicate an array.  inventory is an array of strings.
