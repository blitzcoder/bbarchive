It just shouts louder and is therefore heard by more of the masses. The other OSs are just as, if not more, powerful and are actually easier once ou get away from the hand-holding that windows imposes upon its programmers.<br><br>To compliment what Henri was saying...<br>All OSs have the ability to statically/dynamically load/unload external libraries. BlitzMax can load and use both static and dynamic libraries for all OSs. You can even include the source of those libraries if you know what you're doing. With time and experience you'll be amazed at BlitzMax can do! There are interfaces and binding code written to interface into just about anything and everything you can think of.<br><br>Search the forums for some great samples/codes. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you know windows reasonably well then you can also use directx commands directly in your blitzmax code too. If any of the opengl/directx commands aren't available then you can write the interface yourself :-) You can do anything you want here including all types of shaders - ( vertex / pixel / geometry / tesselation / compute shaders ) and create any effects you could possibly dream up.<br>Playing/streaming is quickly achieved using code from <a href="/codearcs.php?code=3230" target="_blank">this code archive</a>. <br>EDIT:-Oops my mistake, you wanted video for MacOs, however as vlc is cross platform you can probably use that archive as a basis for using vlc on the Mac and write the interfacing code yourself - you know - for learning ;-)<br><br>The key point is that out of the box, BlitzMax is quite basic ( although you do get more than a standard c/c++/c# installation offers!! ), but its really surprisingly powerful and extensible ( via importing c/c++/assembly or importing/loading in libraries ) so if you have the energy and willpower then anything is possible. You'll probably find that pretty every topic you could think of has already been discussed/debated/written already so searching the forums is definitely the first port of call.<br><br>The archives are a treasure trove of all kinds of goodies, also the blitzmax programming forum ( as opposed to the beginners forum ), and also search Bruceys repo for tons and tons of code for all manner of things - where he gets the time I shall never know :D. There's tons of gold nougats of code spread around, and there are still plenty of very experienced programmers here to help out if you need it - replies may be slow lately but I'm sure that you will get a reply.<br><br>Also feel free to give Bruceys BlitzMax-NG a go too ( written in BlitzMax ). Its a full compiler/transpiler so that you can compile your exact same blitzmax source to x86/x64/arm for desktop OSs/raspberry pi/android etc. Its still in development and is quite far along too. Although at this stage you may want to get more comfy with the standard BlitzMax and see what you can do with that until you get some experience under your belt with it as 'Max-NG does require you to be comfortable and have at least some understanding of its build processes. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Stutterfree as in each and every millisecond is stutterfree for hours. Regardless of imperfect driver and garbage collection and "bad" OS's and other things that people normally blame for stuttering when they have gear they know should be able to do their thing.<br><br>With BlitzMax you could easly 10.000+ pixels BUT - 99% stutterfree.

Try to imagine 'max as a midway point between b3d and c++ - you get the language and the ability to create something great but with a sample graphics framework just to get things on screen. btw there are some 3d games written in 'max and there's obviously no way Max2D is responsible for those :-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
