It focused on theory of physics, counters, the purpose of loops and their uses, overall structural theory, but was not platform/language specific, just stated what should happen and why. I remember translating a few really basic ideas into Blitzmax and feeling quite pleased with myself :)<br><br>Anyway, does anyone know any websites like that or the one I mean? I trauled through gamedev.net and found nothing which surprised me.<br><br>Maybe someone knows of (yet another) book I should get hold of?<br><br>More to the point, how did you guys learn this stuff?<br><br>Thanks guys, I swear I'll stop bothering you soon! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

When in 1977 I was at school I had a calculator SR 56 from Texas Instruments. To let the time go by during the boring school hours I invented a game: <br>1) take a starting float value, perhaps SIN(32.48552)<br>2) execute 1/x<br>3) take away the numeric part left from the decimal point<br>4) continue with step 2)<br>I found it fascinating to watch the sequences of calculated values, which often had one or two maxima and then come to a bordering value or become oscillating between two values. So the first console in my life came not from Ninendo or Sony but from Texas Instruments and the first video game in my life had no name - and no characters - at all;)<br>But I would not hesitate to call this a video game  because :<br>-it is interactive (input of the starting value)<br>-it is based on a program<br>-it has a result (reach infinity, a border value or become oscillating) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

My point was that I'll tell every beginner to start with typical programming first, and game oriented programming next. This game oriented programming has all the typical programming and a little bit more to suit your point of view. Take Transport Tycoon for example: it has native windows, buttons, sliders and pulldown menus. So, if you want to code that kinda game without using the OS's native GUI then you'll have to do so yourself. Which is exactly my point: there's so much involved in a game, so many details and non-game-related stuff that the actual gaming part is only a small bit in the total of code.
