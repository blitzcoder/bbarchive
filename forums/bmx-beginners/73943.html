Mind you, I can solve it, but my solution is really bad. Thus, I want to draw upon the collective mind power of the community! :D (although I have a feeling the solution is pretty basic and easy)<br><br>I'm making a game, were there is one type that is a container for all my objects. This type is called "universe", and each object are things like "ship" and "rock". These objects are stored in a TList field in the "universe".<br><br>(don't know how to make those fancy code thingies, sorry)<br>-----------------<br>SuperStrict<br><br>Type TUniverse<br><br>  Field ObjectList:TList<br><br>  Method AddRock()<br>    Local newrock:TRock = TRock.Create(4)<br>    ObjectList.AddLast(newrock)<br>  End Method<br><br>End Type<br><br><br>Type TRock<br><br>  Field Size:Int<br><br>  Function Create:TRock(Size:Int)<br>    Local CreateObject:TRock = New TRock<br>    CreateObject.Size = Size<br>    Return CreateObject<br>  End Function<br><br>End Type<br>-----------------<br><br>This goes fine, and I think this is how most people would do it (althought I've not seen many examples).<br><br>But then comes the problem I'm facing, what if a method within TRock needs to access the TUniverse that it's currently inside?<br><br>I could solve this by having a field inside TRock:<br>"Field ParentUniverse:TUniverse"<br>which holds what universe the TRock is currently under. However, isn't this a very bad solution, since I'm creating a circle reference? Doesn't memory leaks arise from that in BlitzMax?<br><br>Is there a nicer better way I can do it? Or am I at fault for designing the system like this from the start? What way would I use instead?<br><br>Thanks in advance. &lt;3 <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

What is Rock ever going to need to know about the Universe it is in and, if it does, can't it use a GetUniverse function or use a UniverseData type if you have more than one?<br>Finally, is it really bad to have a pointer to its parent Universe when the Rock only appears in a list which happens to be an attribute of Universe?<br>I think you should give that a go as I suspect, once removed from the list, the Rock will be garbage collected when out of scope which will release the pointer to Universe.<br>&lt;edit&gt; Without really knowing your design plans its trick to suggest anything concrete. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Because, this would create a lot of awkward ways of doing things in my eyes.<br><br>For example, when the rock breaks into two, I have a method inside TRock called "BreakIntoTwo()".

If I do the circular cheat, I could do this:<br><br>--------<br>Method BreakIntoTwo()<br>  Self.Size :- 2<br>  Local newrock:TRock = TRock.Create(2)<br>  Self.ParentUniverse.ObjectList.AddLast(newrock)<br>End Method<br>--------<br>But as I said, this is ugly &gt;&gt; (at least I think so)<br><br><br>But, if I was to do things as you say, and do things though the TUniverse, then wouldn't that defeat the purpose of having an own type for the TRock? What use is it to have a TRock if all the TRock methods needs to be within the TUniverse? TRock would be nothing but a collection of variables, with all it's methods shattered around the code.
