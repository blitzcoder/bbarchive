Generally people who write MMO's solve this problem by throwing ridiculous amounts of processing power into the equation, but due to BlitzMAX lacking a good threading model (or for that matter A threading model), your only real option is a scientific breakthrough.

But it's a fairly daunting task. I don't know you, so for all I know you could be a rocket scientist, and making a 2D MMO is something you could do in your sleep.<br><br>An MMO is a complex beast, often taking large  teams of developers several years to complete. Writing the network framework to support the transfer of those enormous amounts of data efficiently is a nontrivial task.<br><br>But hey, don't let some total stranger on the Internet discourage you of your dream. While it may not be immediately feasible in BlitzMAX, or on simple hardware, you can write it in another language (like 3Rings did with PuzzlePirates) or scale down your initial player target, hope that multithreading makes it into BlitzMAX sooner rather than later. Also if you plan to make it scalable, outgoing network traffic is only half of your worries - you're going to want to have separate physical computers talking to each other internally - again a nontrivial task.<br><br>Maybe start off with a MUD or simple multiplayer game - at least that way you'll learn how to deal with the different degrees of complexity inherent to this kind of software. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There is just no way I could code the network side of the MMO-RPG. And even with raknet, which I can't get to work with Dev-C++, it would take me a long time to figure out how to fully utilise it's full potential. I was planing to use:<br><br>HGE 2D Engine with Raknet, I got the HGE engine to work quite well but I failed into being able to install Raknet with it.<br><br>Then tehre was this second option which is<br>SDL with the SDL_NET Library which is said to be fairly easily to use(SDL_NET) and after seeing the TCP commands, it seems fairly easy but I shouldn't fool myself nothing is ease when it comes to networking. However I havent tested this yet. But from what I heared it's hard to install SDL with DEV who knows..<br><br>My 3rd option would be a MMORPG engine which isn't easy to find for the job I wana do. Plus, I havent found any 2D MMORPG Engine. There's only a billion 3D MMORPG Engine like Realm Crafter that is made with Blitz3D. <br><br>Oh another note, I was told it's possible and easier for newbies to use the TCP Protocol to make a MMORPG then the UDP...<br><br>So hopefully I can figure something out... Another question, would it be possible to make the server in C++ and make the client with BlitzMax, I'd say yes because it would be a matter of communication through TCP sockets..<br><br>If I did that then the idea with blitzmax is doable.

But it would be better to use BlitzMAX for both. There are several reasons for this, but the main one is not having to maintain two different versions of the network code.<br><br><div class="quote"> If I did that then the idea with blitzmax is doable. <br></div>I think the best approach here is to start small (much smaller than you're currently thinking), and scale up. If you intend to write a "true" MMO then you're going to need more than one physical computer as server anyhow - so regardless of language you need to come up with a distributed network protocol.<br><br>It also depends on what kind of MMO you want to do. Something like Guildwars is simpler than something like Puzzle Pirates, which is simpler than World Of Warcraft, which again is simpler than something like EVE. You need to start out by planning out how you're going to deal with the network handling, and dispatching traffic to players. Once your preliminary design is ready, implementing is it probably easier than you thought, no matter which language you chose to use.<br><br>If you then find out something isn't quite working, go back to your design and try and see if you can fix it there first. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
