Don't get me wrong here - I am very impressed with Max as a language, but presumably BRL want to sell copies to newcomers and users of B3D and B+, and also customers want a gentle learning curve.<br><br>First things first - the home page is disorganised.  Think about the order users will do things in:  View the user guide, learn the language, look at the modules, play with the examples.<br><br><br>1.  Language Documentation<br><br>The language docs are very good at explaining the little individual bits of the language, but there is nothing which puts it all in perspective, and no explanation of how various language features are useful in a practical environment, or which features are mainly for beginners, and which relate to advanced users.  <br><br>The language docs often assume an existing knowledge of various features, and seem to focus purely on how BlitzMAX works in relation to other languages.<br><br>For example, the explanation of what an array is consists of only one sentence, and some aspects, such as what a multi-dimensional array is are barely covered at all.<br><br>Tech-jargon:  Don't use the words 'inheritance' and 'poly-morphism' in the "Users Guide" for example.  These are scary words for fairly simple concepts, and are likely to turn people away.  The main guide should explain what these are about (without mentioning the "i" and "p" words), and then just mention at the end of the sections that these are the technical terms.<br><br>The largest omission is a lack of explanation about what exactly object-orientated programming is, why it might be useful, and a clear explanation of the alternative approaches to programming in Max.<br><br>2.  Module Documentation<br><br>I think the module documentation is lacking in two main ways.<br><br>Firstly there is no diagram showing how the modules all fit together in the context of a game.  It is not always clear from the names of the modules what they are for - how would I know to look for Input commands in the System module for example?<br><br>I suggest a diagram on the first page of the reference which contains the key catagories (Graphics,Audio,Data Storage,Input-Output,Input etc) and then shows which modules relate to which sections and how the modules relate to each other.  ie. showing that bankstream and ramstream come under stream.<br><br>Secondly, the introduction to some of the modules is a bit weak.  In time a tutorial for making a simple (but all-encompassing) game would be nice from cradle to grave, so to speak.  Meanwhile a tutorial for each major module would be very welcome.  A five or six line example can hardly cover all the necessary aspects.<br><br>3.  Newbie Functions<br><br>I noticed that whilst many of Max's functions are very powerful, there are many important functions that are missing:<br><br>- No RGB or RGBR,RGBB,RGBG commands for creating colours or extracting the elements of a colour.  Needless to say, for anyone looking at the Pixmap documentation this will totally bewilder beginners.<br><br>- CollideImage is very flexible, but far, far too complicated for beginners.  Please add the ImagesCollide function posted on the forums to the Max2D module<br><br>- Print and Input *always* send to stdout.  It would be nice to have Print to be able to route its output to DrawText for example after Graphics had been called (OK, this would not always be desireable, but an option would be nice).<br><br>- Many types have methods which are not exposed in the global functions also in that module (ie. the functions listed in the module reference), TList.First() for example.<br><br>It seems to me that the need to have a function which purely wraps a type method is a bit daft.  Why not have an alias system where the method would be defined like this:<br><br>Method First() Alias "ListFirst"<br><br>Which would allow the user to type "ListFirst listObject" in the code and have the compiler automatically create the wrapper function. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's bewildering to all but a few users on this site. It's nice to know I'm not the only lost soul.<br><br>The mac version's compiler and modules are the only things out of beta. A product like this is so much more than the compiler and modules. Documentation and presentation are equally important. These aspects have been grossly overlooked.<br><br>Imagine a paint package that uses cursor keys as the default input and you have to mess with a config file to enable the mouse and this is undocumented.

Not in b+, b3d and now not in bmax. It has been requested on multiple threads for all versions of blitz. That is just one example, the RGB functions mentioned above are another.<br><br>I understand the "keep things simple" idea, but leaving out functions that would be simple for mark/skid to add, yet extremely hard for a novice. It just makes no sense, why not extend the language with a larger variety of functions/commands so that everyone is happy. Even if some wont be used by 1 person, its not to say that the next person will need said function.<br><br>I dont find the language daunting or anything, it is just tedious having to try and guess how things are working. I think the docs explain the basic function of a command, but they dont go onto explain what it DOESN't do, how it works or the advanced functionality. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Hence it was likely deemed not particularly important for the Mac release.  As it turns out, many existing users <b>have</b> bought max, at least in part due to the (possibly too early?) release of the BETA versions.  They definitely need to create this document for the proper release of max on PC, and may well have every intention of doing so.  BlitzSupport's thread is evidence that they were aware of this very issue from the off, that thread just needs to become part of the documentation.<br><br>I would also appreciate a better means of working out what functions are in which modulea, although I'm not sure I can think of a really good answer to that problem.  An overview diagram as suggested would be an excellent start.  Full text search would also help immensely. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
