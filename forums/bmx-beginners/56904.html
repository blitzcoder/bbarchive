I finished reading all of the documentation under User Guide [+] and was now ready to begin the Language [+] heading in the NavBar. This is where I _thought_ I would start learning how to actually program in Blitzmax. <br><br>I'm totally lost, this doesn't even seem to be documentation in any sense of the word, it's more of a reference for someone who is already a comfortable programmer. I began reading the "Welcome" section which basically tells me nothing other than to read the part about what makes Blitzmax differ from the ordinary BASIC _IF_ I'm a literate BASIC programmer. <br><br>I sincerely hope i've overlooked something, or i've made a mistake. Otherwise I'm highly considering requesting some sort of refund on my purchase. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Test it out for a couple of months and then if you feel you still don't get it ask for a refund. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If Blitzmax perhaps had more User documentation or even a book of some sort I probably wouldn't be complaining, but I have nothing to follow or learn from at all. But realizing the age of Blitzmax I wouldn't expect much anyway. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
