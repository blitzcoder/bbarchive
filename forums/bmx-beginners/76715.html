I originally thought that testing a line-line intersect algorithm using each constraint with each point and it's old position were going to do the trick, but soon realized that the constraints were moving as well (duh!)...<br><br>Is there anybody who has any way of moving the three points (two constraint points and the 'bad' point) in the proper direction / force?<br><br>Thanks, if you help me get this working, I will seriously love you forever.
