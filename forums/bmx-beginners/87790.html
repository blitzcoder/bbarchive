I even have it interfaced into Unity (multithreaded and everything).  Blitzmax on the other hand....  Well it doesn't work anything like expected.....<br><br>DebugStop() doesnt work.  Scratch that, it works, but only in the main source file.  Any other source files and it wont work (well, I've tested it in methods of an instanced class, and it doesnt stop the code or bring up the debugger). <br><br>SocketStream will throw an exception when you try to read a byte of 0 from a UDP stream (or a TCP stream).  So thats out<br><br>TSocket.Recv( byte ptr, length ) doesnt actually receive in just the length you pass to it, it disregards the entire rest of the datagram if you take less than whats available.  Since Reading a 0-value byte from the socketstream throws an exception you essentially have to create your own stream class and hope to god your getting the whole datagram as you build a stream manually...  Secondly where is the documentation for TSocket?  Looking at source code just to figure out how to use something is a very annoying and indicates laziness for he who made the product originally.  Interestingly enough, a TCP socket will not queue up a whole packet as 'ready' (will happen in chunks, I've even seen a packet of 6 bytes split up) but UDP wont (the datagram, and any behind it, is lost if you dont read the whole 'ready' buffer right then and there).  Which is strange because in c# I've noticed that UDP can come in and be pulled off the stack in any way you like where TCP comes in to the stack as a complete packet.<br><br>Threading is a royal pain.  Easy as pie in c# and I understand synchronization but Blitzmax and the whole mutex concept and rules around what you can run in a thread and what you cant is documented nowhere....  <br><br>Debugging is semi-useless.  Globals show up, the function your in shows up, but Class level variables dont (which I prefer to use over app wide globals), nor does any really relevant info (stack info, etc).  I have an object that isn't being garbage collected and I cannot figure out where the hell a ref for it is...  I went through it 10+ times in code making sure I release all the references to it, but it still isn't being garbage collected.... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
