Its handled like this in Java and C# as well, so surely not bad design, there are just cases where it is not possible to do clean OO without cyclic class references.<br><br>(with cyclic ref I mean classes that refer to classes through fields each other. Not object *class instances* that have references to each other. That is actually crap as it has a high potential for GC memory leak)<br><br>And I think you agree that clean OO is much better than "I got it without cyclic class usage, just check out my pro user hack" :-)<br><br>PS: Yes I normally try to get some tree like hierarchy in. But there were some cases where it was not possible without making the classes that stupid hard / complicated to use and highly unintuitive that it was just not acceptable as a solution. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But the reason I was asking the question was because I <b>am</b> importing things that import other things that I am also importing. (If you see what I mean)<br>And as far as I can see this cyclic problem doesnt exist. This was in part why I asked the question in the first place, but rather than make it a big "cyclic" issue I simplifed it.

However, if you are putting one type per file (which seems a good Idea), then when you are testing/writting an extended type you want to "Include" the base type, (and I at least want superstrict). The problem with this is that in the main file you cannot now include the extended type because 1) Dupplicate includes. 2) At least 2 Superstricts.<br><br>Honestly although its a pain, cos its not in my opinion as intuitive as Include, import works really well. And I dont now have to edit out all the superstricts and includes in my newly converted to import files.<br><br><div class="quote"> lazyness = Blide + Framework Assistant <br></div>I love FA, the problem is tho that FA will not tell me which of <b>my</b> files/mods I need to Import. And more importantly in this situation I know that I am Importing the same file twice, but its staying like that because its easyer to edit individual files if I leave the multiple imports in, (Which if you see above I couldnt do with Includes). I just wanted to be sure that I wasnt giving mysefl an unnessesary overhead.<br><div class="quote"> not use FA until your program is going to be shared <br></div>I hear you. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
