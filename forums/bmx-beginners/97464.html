Think of something simple you want to make, if you are here to make games than make a small and simple game to start with. Most people start with a game like Space Invaders. whatever you decide to do, break it down and start to think what you are going to need to do to get it done then figure out how you are going to do each step. Aside from learning the commands the hardest part to learn to do is the logic.  If you are making a space invaders game, these are things you are going to need to learn to do:<br><br>Learn to load an image, move it around the screen with the keyboard or mouse.<br>learn how to shoot bullets, animate images and create explosions. <br>learn how to keep score and display it.<br>Learn how to create, store and delete objects of "Type"s from "List"s.<br><br>below are commands you are going to have to lear for BlitzMax. Not a complete list but I think you can do just about do any type of game with those:<br>' ****** graphics set up *******<br>Graphics, Cls, Flip<br><br>' ****** variable and variable types<br>Byte, Short, Int,Long,Float,Double,String,Long,byte<br>[ ]   &lt;--------(array)<br>Local, Global, Const <br><br>' ********* math operators. *********<br>=, +, -, *, /, ^, Mod, Sqr, Sin, Cos,Tan, Atan2<br><br>'********output commands.<br>DrawImage, DrawText, DrawOval, DrawLine, DrawRect, Print<br><br>' ********procedure<br>Function, Return<br><br>' *********logic<br>If Then Else<br>'*******logic operators<br>&lt;, &gt;, =, &lt;=, &gt;=, Or, And, Not<br><br>'**********loops<br>While/Wend, Repeat/Until, For/Next<br><br>'******** type/structure<br>Type, Field, Method,<br><br>'output/display<br>LoadImage, LoadAnimImage<br><br>'*********input<br>KeyDown,KeyHit, MouseDown,MouseX,MouseY<br><br><br>' *object Management and storage.<br>List and [](Arrays)<br><br><br>'*****More advanced that you can do with out for now:<br><br>Abstract,Extends  &lt;----- advanced type commands<br>Var                       &lt;-----for functins<br>Int Ptr, Byte Ptr     &lt;-----variable value address acces<br>OpenFile/CloseFIle &lt;----- file manipulation.<br>OpenStream/closeStream &lt;------file manipulation<br>Bank      &lt;-------------data manipulation<br>&amp;, |, ~    &lt;-------------bit Operators<br><br>Don't try to memorize them all at once. look at them have an idea of what they are used for. Only concentrate on what you think might be useful for the game you are going to be working on and most of all be patient. You wont get a programmer's state of mind in a week. It's going to take much much much..... longer than that. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Some people would certainly benefit from a micro lesson approach and I would encourage you to make it and post it in the tutorials section, I'm sure there will be people who gain from it, and certainly you will learn some more by making it (new ways to think about things, stumble across some new commands, etc.).<br><br>Personally I learn by doing. I get an idea and I bumble my way towards it. I think this is generally a popular way for people to learn programming, specifically game development. Few people get into game development (and my extension bmax) because they want to learn about code logic, they want to make a game. The consensus is that you use that motivation to drag yourself through the basics. But again, everyone is different, and at the very least it could possibly be an augmented reference for functions and basic program flow to help people get their thoughts in order.<br><br>It's like any development project, if you have an interest go for it, you'll learn something and if you see it through other people gain from the end product too! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There are a couple of tutorials about OOP in the tutorials section and that is about as close as you are going to get to a tutorial about OOP from here. Since you are familiar with programming, you are probably familiar with most of the commands I mentioned in the previous post and I am assuming you can already produce an executable with functions, if statements and loops. So, what you really need is a tutorial on logic and techniques. if that's what you are looking for then you either need to go to school for it or buy a few books on the subject. <br><br>there have been other programmers that have attempted to do something similar, such ideas are short lived because every body that really knows the language is busy with their own thing or don't bother with it.  If you pay attention there are only a hand full of users that normally hang around here that really know their subject and I can tell you that most will not bother or even answering a question in the beginner's forum. Maybe because they don't have time or they don't have the patience.  There have been Wiki Pages and other community projects started that never took off because of lack of cooperation by the community. just to give you a good example, look at the Blitzmax online manual: <br><br><a href="http://www.blitzmax.com/bmdocs/topics.php" target="_blank">http://www.blitzmax.com/bmdocs/topics.php</a><br><br>it was made so that the community would help in creating a well documented manual but If you look at it, it's no better than the one that's included in the IDE.  I am sure it's the same with other languages that are not mainstream. Now and then you get somebody that is willing to take the time to teach or write a tutorial but is very rare so we count our blessings. <br><br>Many of these programmers that know how to code went 4 years or more to college and have degrees and are working in their field. They did not get a free ride to a programming career. trying to learn in a few semi professional tutorials over a few months is not going to replace the discipline thought by a college or university.  You can read professional books as an alternative but as you say it's hard to keep motivated. I have been there.<br><br><br>I would recommend(and that is what I used to do when I started programming many years ago) to  write your code and submit it for criticism. There, maybe you will get some help.  <br><br>These two tutorials were helpful even even years after I had learned some of the basics of OOP<br><br><a href="http://www.blitzmax.com/Community/posts.php?topic=42519" target="_blank">http://www.blitzmax.com/Community/posts.php?topic=42519</a><br><a href="http://www.blitzmax.com/Community/posts.php?topic=78860" target="_blank">http://www.blitzmax.com/Community/posts.php?topic=78860</a><br><br>which I am sure you seen.<br><br>you can try your Idea and I will surely cooperate if you don't mind. But, my Opinion is that I believe it will just be another thread that will disappear with the hundred of other suggestions for tutorials and wiki pages started trough out the years.<br><br>On a side note, If you are trying to learn real OOP BlitzMax is good for the first steps but for real OOP you are going to find out that it comes out short.<br><br>Sorry If I sound too negative or too harsh. That is not my intention but it has been my experience with this community through out the years. BlitzMax is a good tool and there are programmers making a living with it but maybe it's just not for everybody. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
