With graphics you can have separate arrays for each 'component' of your vertex data ( this mean an array of vertices, another array for colors etc ) or you can pack the data into 1 single array, it's to you as a programmer to decide what best suits your problem case. For single packed arrays, at first it might be confusing with byte strides etc but it's really quite easy. I've just knocked up this code to hopefully help show how to setup a packed array of x,y,r,g,b vertex data and render it as points.<br><textarea class=codebox name="code" wrap=OFF readonly="true" rows="15" cols="80">

To use another coord space you can manipulate the vertice data yourself, or set up transform matrices to convert from one coord space to another, or set various parameters in gl and have it do some of the hard work for us :D Say for example you want to use screen space coords from 0 to 800 for the width and 0 to 600 for the height then ( gl has some convenient functions to help :) ) as you want 2d you can use the glOrtho function to change the projection matrix for us to map the screen space coords to the normalized device coord.<br><br>Also, my apologies if you tried to adjust the above example for experimenting as there is a bug in the offsetting used in the vertice setup function - that'll teach me for typing straight into the forum :-)<br><br>Here's the above example 'working as expected' for you to see the subtle differences...<br><textarea class=codebox name="code" wrap=OFF readonly="true" rows="15" cols="80">

</textarea><br><br>There are a couple of things to note with the example. The vertices are still being setup as float values - the reason being is the OpenGL spec. The spec says that the vertex positions can be GL_SHORT, GL_INT, GL_FLOAT, or GL_DOUBLE, and that the color data can be either GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE or GL_FLOAT, and as the array is a float array for all components (xyrgb) then its easier to keep with that - just in this example. Don't forget that you can set up 2 arrays and use GL_INT for the vertice data and then use a byte array for the rgb color ( range from 0 to 255 for each r,g,b ), or even pack the rgb bytes into an integer if you really wanted to, the choice is all up to the programmer. My main reason I did the example that way is to show how to use a packed array and what the parameters actually mean and refer to. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
