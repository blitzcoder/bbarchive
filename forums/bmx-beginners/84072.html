Your tendency to that is pretty well known on the web. Do something about that and get a good reputation and the situation might look differently.<br><br>As long as you handle such situation as if someone is trying to kill your "baby" (thats how you behave in various cases and how you always behaved), your reputation suffers but whats even worse, people will stop reporting issues which in the end will result in a product that isn't as good as it could be. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The features of BlitzMax and the features of these 3D engines seem worth the upgrade to me, but I'm just wondering how steep the learning curve is? Blitz3D was about as easy as it gets when it comes to 3D game making.<br><br>And while on this topic, which of these engines would probably be the easiest to learn? From Naughty Alien's post, it sounds like Flow3D is the way to go. I'm also concerned with overall stability of the engines as well.<br><br>If anybody could provide more insight, I'd appreciate it.<br><br>Edit - Also, Dreamora you are correct, I'm doing this as a casual/hobby thing.
