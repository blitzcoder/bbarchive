It also adds access to the native windows GUI, and allows you to interact with DLL's)<br><br>Blitzmax can do the same, but much more in addition to that:<br><br>1) You can still write procedural code very similar to the old Blitzbasic / Blitzplus style, but it will also support basic object-oriented programming<br><br>2) Blitzplus is 2D, everything is done by pushing pixels to the screen. Blitzmax is 2D-in-3D, which means that you get hardware accelerated 3D effects such as zooming, rotating, blending, alpha-transparancy, etc. which can make games look *much* more polished<br><br>3) Blitzmax is modular by design, you can download hundreds of (mostly free) 3rd party add-one modules that extend the functionality: 3D engines, database engines, graphic effects, movie playback, and much more. It also means that compiled programs are potentially smaller since you can choose not to include unused modules unlike Blitzplus where the entire command library is included in every program.<br><br>4) Blitzmax is cross-platform: Buy one, and you can run blitzmax on windows, Mac and Linux, and compile the same program on all three with little to no changes<br><br>5) Blitzmax has some other more advanced capabilities like Multi-threading, where your program can use multiple CPU cores if necessary. (Does require a extra work and careful planning to implement, though)<br><br>Between the two, there's really no contest: Blitzmax all around.<br>Blitzplus really only has one thing going for it: for a limited time, it's free: <a href="http://blitzbasic.com/Products/_index_.php" target="_blank">http://blitzbasic.com/Products/_index_.php</a><br><br><br>Or, as Gfk mentioned, there's Monkey.  Command-set wise it's more  limited than Blitzmax, but it has the benefit of being able to create flash, HTML5, GFLW, XNA, android and apple iOS applications. There's probably additional platform targets out by now as well. The programming style is pretty different though, so it may take a bit longer to learn. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This is only useful for targeting older systems.<br><br>~  BlitzPlus has the ability to use DLLs and directly access many non-COM Windows APIs.<br><br><br>As others have said, BlitzMax would be my suggestion of what to use.
