On most computers, character animations, text scrolling and everything runs &gt;&gt;&gt;60 fps without any slowdown... The game runs in windowed mode, the size of the window being more or less the size of the desktop. On some computers (especially a netbook and a  recent desktop computer with a cheap graphics chip on the motherboard, both running XP) unfortunately it's not that smooth...<br><br>After a close examination of all animations, I went to the conclusion that the game went a bit slow only when a certain amount of text was displayed, using a ttf font and the drawtext command (either about 25 homemade buttons with some text inside, or a few lines of text). No complicated calculations were needed during those animations, just drawing a few things at fixed coordinates. The interface loop is also very minimalistic during animations. When I cut the framerate to 30 fps using a frame skipping routine, which is still good for such a game, it's OK again, but I'd like the game to run flawlessy on any not-too-old PC. <br><br>Is there any explanation and/or any remedy? <br><br>Thank you in advance for your help!! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I know the problem, because often our customers have the same small computers. It is caused by the graphic cards. They cannot work as fast as new data are coming in.<br><br>So we always try to do this: If you have fixed areas, where nearly nothing happens during the animation. f.e. areas with buttons etc... try to paint them not as often as the center of your screen. Do not use CLS, but a backgound  picture which already contains all fix background elements. <br><br>You could also render this background "on the fly" with "GrabImage" at the beginning of the game (..which needs once 200msec ).<br><br>Also an idea is to use 30Hz instead of 60Hz. Often the consumption of performance decrease from 100% to 10% with the half Frequency. You could combine 60Hz timer with a 30Hz paint refreshing and will not loose any speed in the game:<br><br>symbolic code:<br><pre class=code>Graphics 800,600

type tbutton
  field x:int,y:int,w:int,h:int
  field dirty:int =0
  field image:Timage
  field text:string="Mytext"

</pre><br><br>above code was not tested... just written within seconds.<br><br>The idea is to store the "generated" output. Using this you can style up the text with underlying ones (emboss, shadow...).<br><br>Use the same technique for Tooltip/Hover-Boxes... but this will slightly increase memory usage as the cache are "timages".<br><br><br>What you could also do - to make it even more useable:<br>Write your BitmapFont-Engine (which loads TTFs, renders them on a texture), write a "paste char to image/pixmap"-function and generate images which hold your text (with alpha, shadows, ...).<br><br>That way you can also write hiscore-text on the screen or you could have animated button-backgrounds.<br><br>But at the end you would write a generic "image cache"-system which could be used for much more than just texts (here you benefit from your own bitmapfont-class - as then images and fonts are the same - only missing thing is lines/rects/ovals).<br><br>The last mentioned thing is only preferable if you have no option to do something like buffered drawing or render-to-texture. In that case you would have to implement a kind of texture atlas to cached images too (store eg. 20 text-cacheimages on one texture to speed it up even more)<br><br><br>bye Ron<br><br>oh edit: as old SiS-cards were mentioned.... I've done first tests with Blitzmax years ago - also with a sis 741 on one test pc. At that time you had problems with image size (&gt;512x512 cut fps on my SiS) and text display. That time I hoped to get something like dirty-rects - would improve performance even more.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

When I started this new project, I was suggested to redraw everything everytime to avoid issues, which especially occured on Mac but also on a few PCs...
