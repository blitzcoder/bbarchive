Think the way the Max2D or MaxAudio Modules are built into Blitzmax. I mean Driver vise. <br>To have this working with the different 3D Engines you have to <br>make a more or less lower level version of each engine which provides access to the renderpipeline in the same way the other engines do. After that you could create a main 3D core module which provides the highlevel functions in an abstract way and built easily a different '3DEngine Drivers'. <br><br>But what do you benefit from this:<br>I think nothing. You have to maintain a lot of different APIs most engines, they use different coord systems and the most annoying thing is that the developer has to know what is going on under the hood of all these drivers to provide good support to his customers. Also not every engine has the same feature set or handles features different then others so you have to keep all the extra things (mainly advantages) <br>of an engine out of the drivers because you need the same functionality on each driver.<br>Take the maxgui system:<br>We have 3 Drivers providing nearly the same behaviour to us customers, but take a deeper look how difficult it is to provide the same functionality and look on each platform for BRL. Also we all want features like Tablelists and the like but they could only be built in when these features are available for each Driver everythingelse would collapse the Driverthingy. <br>So in my opinion this is a no go, providing 2 different APIs like openGl/DX maybe possible but wrapping different engines to provide the same functionality is a work without light at the end of the tunnel.<br><br>cheers klepto2 <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
