WaitKey()
</pre><br>I build and run the program, and it compiles sucessfully, but I see no output, and it does not wait for a key to finish.<br><br><br>/edit<br><br>Nevermind, I think I figured it out.  I have to use the graphics command to enable polled input.  It would have been nice if the WaitKey() help said that polled input had to be anabled to use it, but I guess they figure that I should have to look at the top of each help page when looking at the help for a command to be absolutely sure there's no little dependencies I should be aware of.<br><br>That said, why in the hell did Mark make 60 the default setting for Hz in the graphics command?  Shouldn't it defualt to not screwing with the monitor's default refresh rate?  Is Mark not aware that you have to set your monitor up for every reolsution and refresh rate, and that people will probably have weird vertically or horizontally squished screens when the game changes to a special refresh rate for a particular resolution, and it hasn't been set up on the PC yet?  Also, some people don't have their PC configured properly, and windows might think their monitors are capable of 100hz at 1600x1200 and they're not, and the monitor goes boom.  Bad form setting the refresh rate on people.  Commercial games have been released that do that and I think the guy at Voodoo Extreme had one break his monitor.<br><br>/edit2<br><br>Aww man... And the IDE still has this stupid tendancy to copy the font settings when text is copied from the help file, so I can't copy and paste commands and then fill in the parameters still.  Augh!<br><br>/edit3<br><br>Does the graphics command default to 0 for depth, or 16?  The help says 0.  The Wiki says 16.  And neither says what a value of 0 will do.  I'm hoping it will use the color depth of the desktop, but I suspect that it just does 16bit by default.<br><br>/edit4<br><br>Wtf?  Even with the graphics command, while I do get it to print something, it still doesn't wait for a key.  It just exits immediately! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
