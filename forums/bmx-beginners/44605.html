So you get access to the new features right away, but it takes a while for them to become "standard" and even longer for them to become "core". But to say that OpenGL doesn't get new features straight away is just plain wrong - often the extensions are available for OpenGL before they reach the DirectX core. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Basicly a bunch of anoracks too short sighted to see the value of the realtime effects DX was producing. So thanks to those guys Gl has always dithered around and never had the opportunity to catch up with DX's rapid evolution and willingness to embrace new technology.<br><br>That being said v2.0 has a nice set of features, unfortunately hardware manufacturers tend to not support GL as well as D3D simply because there are few games for other platforms that require them. Perhaps with PS2 taking on Nvidia graphics hardware we may see more going on in th egL camp.<br><br>Unfortunately this doesn't help game dev much today. 95% of art tools that are any good use D3D vertex and pixel shaders, .FX files, DDS compressed textures etc. so its a real pain in the ass to develop anything with high end graphics features with GL.
