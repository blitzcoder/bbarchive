What does everyone do in terms of making a game editor for your game? <br><br>I created a clunky, bug filled editor using MaxGui. I've spent way too much time trying to create the editor and working around things like the canvas not updating, being laggy, etc. It's also my understanding that MaxGui is a tiny bit diminished since it's not being worked on anymore. <br><br>I think my needs aren't special, the ability to have a staging area for graphics, place those objects in the game world, the ability to modify properties of those objects on the fly. <br><br>I'm thinking of basically scrapping my current editor and just write the whole thing in Blitzmax. I don't have to keep figuring out gadgets, canvases, etc. <br><br>Thoughts? I know this is mostly a matter of opinion but would love to hear it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

As long as they do the job they were designed for, then not much else matters.  The only caveat is when the editor is being included as part of the finished product, then the editor needs as much polish as the game itself. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

'Time' is your most valuable asset ever.<br><br>If you can find tools that, even if separately, can generate the all the content you need, go for it. <br>The content will most likely be in a 'generic' form so it can be used by a lot of different projects, so your task here will be creating the interface to interpret the content these tools generate - instead of creating the tools themselves (which generally costs more time). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You may as well roll your own so it works exactly how you want it. <br><br>I do agree though an in house editor doesn't need to be fancy, it just needs to work. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I would totally avoid maxgui, not so much for compatibility or interface reasons but like you said it can be a lot of work setting up windows and gadgets and all that lark. It can be much quicker to just decide okay I'm going to drawtext something over here and when I click within that `zone` of the screen it does something.<br><br>But if you're making an in-game editor for the public to use then you really have to stop and plan and design it well for usability and simplicity and obviousness and providing appropriate functionality, not too complex, and style it so that it's in line with the game, unless you don't mind it being fairly boring and ordinary - more of an off-line editor, as opposed to extending the game experience. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
