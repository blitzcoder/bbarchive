There's that, or "Bad design decisions".<br><br>One of the most useful aspects of OOA&amp;D is polymorphism. A scary buzzword compliant concept. It involves several different types that all implement the same interface (Blitz doesn't really support interfaces yet, but you can use Abstract methods instead - an abstract method is one that is not implemented in this type, but must instead be imlemented by the sub-class). Now all your enemies on-screen have some identical behavior, like move and shoot for example. So if you make a type that has abstract move() and shoot() methods, you can ensure that <b>regardless of actual implementation</b> the move() and shoot() methods will be implemented by all objects that extend that interface, thus you can itterate through them all simultaneously and have them all execute different move algorythms, from within the same loop without having to go Select alien.type etc...<br><br>Why else is this useful? Well one example is the <a href="http://www.dofactory.com/Patterns/PatternTemplate.aspx" target="_blank">Template Method Pattern</a> which allows you to "Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure."<br><br>Now there's nothing new here, this is something you've done a million times over already, I'm sure. The difference here is that now it's being handled by the computer, rather than a hornets nest of If..Then..Else and/or Select..Case statements. It makes for more readable and manageable code.<br><br><div class="quote"> Is it faster?  <br></div>Nope. Actually it's technically slower, but not significantly so. The advantages by far out weigh the performance hit you might get.<br><br>I know as an ex-Amiga programmer it's hard to come to terms with not writting uber optimised code. Usually it's about striking a balance between making it fast, and making it managable, and so far processor speed is way ahead of human capacity to organize efficiently, and is increasing much faster than we are. Thus the side-effect is, we get less optimised code, but it crashes less often, and when it does we don't risk breaking something else while trying to fix it.<br><br>In theory. :o&gt; <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I use polymorphism for moving. There is a base (Super) class called Human which implements stuff common to Enemies and Players, namely how to move based on it's direction and speed. Now that code is used by both enemies and players. Then there is an abstract method that use used to decide on where to move. All humans need to decide where to move, it's just that Enemies and Players do it differently. Players get their input from the keyboard, Enemies need to think about where to move, and in my Loderunner clone, that means they use A* to find a path. The results of the movement decision is a set of "state" that all humans share telling the human where to try to move to. Then in the actual move part, any common stuff is handled (Banging into sides, being able to walk up or down, moving along the bar, falling etc) and then specialisations of movement for the specific Humans. For instance, enemies when they've fallen into a hole, must not fall throgh it and wait. Humans can fall through holes if there is nothing below them. <br><br>OO is a paradigm, you can implement a lot of it with procedural functions, just passing in objects to the functions, but once you understand and use it a bit you see that it's very helpful in keeping your code together.<br><br>Inheritance is nice, because you can have methods, functions etc that take base class types and know how to handle derived classes automatically. As Mikkel said if you were using procedure stuff, you might have to do something like:<br><br>Select object.type<br>  case enemy<br>    MoveEnemy(object)<br>  case human<br>    MoveHuman(object)<br>End Select<br><br><br>With OO you would just go<br><br>object.move()<br><br><br>Another example in my Loderunner stuff is that I have a distance function type that knows how to calculate distances between two 'positions'. Now my AStar stuff just knows about that base type and calls a method for getting distance, but I can now derive different functions and ways of finding distances, and my AStar code doesn't have to change - at all cause I just pass it in a different function to use, as an object.<br><br><br><br>Aaron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Strangely I've had to rewrite this response comment several times for several reasons. Correct me if you think I'm wrong or I am not grasping this.<br><br>I can see how procedural code in general has a very fixed structure and although it can jump around based on various conditions it is still a pretty fixed model. Things flow in one direction, they have to go through specific pathways, everything has to be pre-thought-out and preconceived. Then all of those preconceptions are solidified into a hard-wired program, and of course the lower-level you get the more that is true because at the lowest level everything is very rigid and fixed.<br><br>Then you have this `orientation` of looking at things in a more individualized manner, which we happen to call things objects, where you try to decouple some of the functionality from being so locked in to a fixed structure. You try to go from a totally linear world to more of a non-linear world where you don't have to do everything in these fixed sequences in order to directly access the appropriate objects or get specific objects to do certain things. Objects give you more freedom to kind of move from a linear forwards-executing structure to a more non-linear structure of program excecution. And since we tend to think of things in the world as confined objects it's probably easier to map worldly imaginings onto an object-oriented view of things. Instead of there being one `center` to the program, there are now multiple cores (objects) each relatively individual and independent and able to go about it's business. I guess that's a step in a better direction.<br><br>But what beyond that? What is beyond that separation between objects? What about a model where objects are not so definitely separate from each other and can merge and un-merge at will? (yeah, object nookie ;-) What about objects that are sometimes objects and sometimes everything, like electrons that come in and out of finite existence? What about every object having an underlying unity through which they all share common ground? Isn't that an even more useful and realistic model than traditional OO?

What is beyond that separation between objects? <br></div>To better answer that I refer you to Brucke Eckels book <a href="http://www.mindview.net/Books/TIJ/" target="_blank">Thinking in Java</a> which although obviously written for Java, has an excellent introduction to OO principles in the first couple of chapters, and much of it applies equally well to BlitzMAX.<br><br>Excerpt:<br><div class="quote"> All programming languages provide abstractions. It can be argued that the complexity of the problems you’re able to solve is directly related to the kind and quality of abstraction. By “kind” I mean, “What is it that you are abstracting?” Assembly language is a small abstraction of the underlying machine. Many so-called “imperative” languages that followed (such as FORTRAN, BASIC, and C) were abstractions of assembly language. These languages are big improvements over assembly language, but their primary abstraction still requires you to think in terms of the structure of the computer rather than the structure of the problem you are trying to solve. The programmer must establish the association between the machine model (in the “solution space,” which is the place where you’re modeling that problem, such as a computer) and the model of the problem that is actually being solved (in the “problem space,” which is the place where the problem exists). The effort required to perform this mapping, and the fact that it is extrinsic to the programming language, produces programs that are difficult to write and expensive to maintain, and as a side effect created the entire “programming methods” industry.<br><br>The alternative to modeling the machine is to model the problem you’re trying to solve. Early languages such as LISP and APL chose particular views of the world (“All problems are ultimately lists” or “All problems are algorithmic,” respectively). PROLOG casts all problems into chains of decisions. Languages have been created for constraint-based programming and for programming exclusively by manipulating graphical symbols. (The latter proved to be too restrictive.) Each of these approaches is a good solution to the particular class of problem they’re designed to solve, but when you step outside of that domain they become awkward.<br><br>The object-oriented approach goes a step further by providing tools for the programmer to represent elements in the problem space. This representation is general enough that the programmer is not constrained to any particular type of problem. We refer to the elements in the problem space and their representations in the solution space as “objects.” (You will also need other objects that don’t have problem-space analogs.) The idea is that the program is allowed to adapt itself to the lingo of the problem by adding new types of objects, so when you read the code describing the solution, you’re reading words that also express the problem. This is a more flexible and powerful language abstraction than what we’ve had before. Thus, OOP allows you to describe the problem in terms of the problem, rather than in terms of the computer where the solution will run. There’s still a connection back to the computer: each object looks quite a bit like a little computer—it has a state, and it has operations that you can ask it to perform. However, this doesn’t seem like such a bad analogy to objects in the real world—they all have characteristics and behaviors. <br></div><br><br><div class="quote"> I don't want all my objects to be lonely little objects. No man is an island. ;-)  <br></div>Yeah you do. One of the great things about having 'atomic' objects is that it becomes very easy to test whether an object works (or not).<br><br>Besides you'll never get truely 'atomic' objects anyway, there will be co-dependant objects in any program, but by minimising this you create a program structure that is easier to maintain, and you can restrict rewrites of code to isolated objects, and still have a working program.<br><br>Instead of having to test your entire program at once, and praying it works, you can now test each individual parts functionality individually of other parts (unit test).<br><br><div class="quote"> There's no correct way to program. If it works, it's correct!  <br></div>Ofcourse. OOP is not about programming more correctly (after all, OOP is nothing but an abstraction). OOP is about programming smarter, letting the compiler handle many of the issues you might otherwise have to deal with manually. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

One of the great things about having 'atomic' objects is that it becomes very easy to test whether an object works (or not).  <br></div><br><br>Wider words have never been spoken. Unit testing is relatively new concept to me. I've managed to be a developer for yers without it. In the last couple of years though I have been pulled into this ideology and I must admit, while it seems at first to be a lot of work for nothing, the end result is very worth while. Especially down the track when you then realise that the maintenance you are doing on your software, and classes is minimal comnpared to what you used to do.<br><br>Also of course, these tests can be automated in most cases, so a build system is created to keep your code compiling and working consistently.<br><br>That makes me think...Maybe someone needs to design a nice unit testing framework for BlitzMax...I'll have a think about that.<br><br>Aaron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
