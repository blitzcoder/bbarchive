Blitz does assume you've had some other programming experience before, hence the colon not being elaborated on since it's such a fundamental part of the language syntax.<br><br>My first few weeks in Blitz was spent playing with the sample programs provided with it, tweaking a variable here, adding a little there, tackling the notation bits I didn't understand, etc. Between that and using the help functionality built right into the IDE I was able to get things moving nicely.<br>At first I didn't bother too much with why the finer concepts did or didn't work, until I could wrap my head around the basics.<br><br>I think what you'd like is something more of an absolute beginner's guide to programming in general - have you done some before?<br>(Sorry if that sounds in any way condescending, it's REALLY not supposed to)<br><br>FYI: When declaring a variable, the colon means "is an". For example:<br>Local x:int - This means variable x "is an" integer.<br>There are shortcut notations too like Local x# or even just Local x (Blitz assumes it's an integer if no type is specified) but don't let it confuse you.

The BRL docs really are just a reference manual for syntax and even that isn't explained clearly in many cases. It's really not pitched at a beginner to programming. It sort of says `this is how blitzmax works and these are the commands you have to use, go write some programs`.
