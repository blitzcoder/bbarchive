Been a long time since I've been on.<br><br>I've got an engine in C++/DirectX and it uses the ID3DXSprite class.<br><br>My engine is for 2D only (using 3D hardware) and is quite fast.<br><br>My problem is that while I love C++, I also love BB (been a fan since the Amiga days).  I want RAPID development of my projects.  Life is too short to be spending time on some of this stuff.  :-)<br><br>Anyway, my goal for a system is this:<br><br>1) 2D sprites with FAST, HARDWARE GPU support of rotation, alpha-blending, scaling, color tinting<br><br>2) Enough power to render a 320x240 screen with many many tiles.  I am greedy.  I want FOUR layers of tiles scrolling in 8-directions, 20-50 enemy sprites of good size and my main character.  In other words, tons of sprites.<br><br>3) Good audio.  I normally use FMOD so that shouldn't be a problem with BMAX.<br><br>Everything else should easily be handled but just about any engine.  My C++ engine can do all those things now. <br><br>But once again, I am looking at something that saves time.<br><br>Using BlitzPlus a year ago, I did in two weeks what it took me three months to do in C++.  Not because C++ is hard, but because of my time contraints.<br><br>I'm at work now to no playing but tonight I am going to download the demo and see what it can do.  I would gladly shell out $80 for something that would do everything I need.<br><br>Thanks!<br>cbmeeks<br><a href="http://metroidclassic.com" target="_blank">http://metroidclassic.com</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

All graphics are hardware accelerated 2D using the GPU. You probably wouldn't have much problem drawing four layers of tiles and 50 enemy sprites at a much higher resolution than 320x240 at 60Hz framerate .... with a reasonably popular low-mid range graphics card. It already supports rotation, alpha blending, scaling, realtime color tinting, and smooth-filtering.<br><br>Development in Max is pretty quick, it does even more for you than the old BlitzBasic used to do, ie is even higher level. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

"Good enough," is of course subjective.  Generally you want to use the lesser interface that your application needs.  If your app doesn't need anything more than what DX7 already provides, then there's no sense on using DX9, it'll only limit who can run your app.  Believe it or not, B+ uses DX1, and since you seem happy with that except for alpha blending and rotation, then you should be just fine with BMax.  DX7 handles alpha and rotation just fine through hardware.<br>Also, if you just HAVE to have DX9, it is possible to add it to BMax.  BMax could be just as capable of running a D3D9Max2DDriver() as it is running a D3D7Max2DDriver(), the only thing is that BMax currently doesn't ship with one, so you'd have to write one, or find someone to write one for you.  It shouldn't be too difficult to look through the D3D7 modules and convert them to work on D3D9.<br>Another thing to look at is sswift's sprite system.  I don't own it, but it does look very impressive and the ones who have bought it seem very pleased. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
