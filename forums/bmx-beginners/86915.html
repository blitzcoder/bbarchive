Am I right in thinking that Blitzplus handles listboxes etc just as well as VB?<br><br>More importantly however, I want to be able to publish my finished application to a webpage and have it auto-update when I create a new version. This is really handy for my business (which is an email Football-management game) as it means I don't have to mess around announcing updates all the time. Is there any way to do this with either BP or BM? Maybe even with a 3rd-party installer or something? Or would I be right in thinking that any completed BP/BM product would need to first be packaged with an installer and then downloaded/installed by the user?<br><br>While I'm asking lots of questions, is BM still being updated and are newer versions in the pipeline?<br><br>Sorry for lots of questions in one topic :p <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Blitzplus handles listboxes etc... - honestly I don't know, you should post in the BP forum or test the demo version.<br>Bmax with its own MaxGUI module offers a 'standard' GUI for every platform, and sure it can handle listboxes<br><br>2. Auto-update: I'm quite sure someone has written an application/framework for this option (I dont' remember the name sorry!), but in any case is not a hard work.<br><br>3. BM is still being updated? Yes of course, BRL has recently released r.134, and fixes and improvements will be surely present <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'm NOT comfortable with VB and it's limits. If I can do the things I want with BM, I'm switching back :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Firstly it was too complicated and people really can't be bothered learning complex games nowadays (well most people can't). Secondly it waited for a league to fill before it started processing, which doesn't work for the first guy who joins. And thirdly, yes, it needs to be browser-based so no downloading etc.<br><br>There are some browser-based games out there already. I'd consider re-writing it in a browser but I don't think I can do that in Blitz :( <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
