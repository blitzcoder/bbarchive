Those "development guidelines" you refer to tell developers to put their files and folders which need write access in one of the appdata folders. That means BRL, not the users.

When you install BlitzMax, BRL is the developer.<br><br>The BlitzMax installer does not do this, and as such, it is precisely BRL's fault that this issue arises, not the users.
