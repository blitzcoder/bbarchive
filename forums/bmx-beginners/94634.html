So try to get something that you feel you understand (good writing style, etc.) to get your head around the basics of logic, application flow, variables, memory etc. Those things really never change and are the foundation of ANYTHING written in any programming language.<br><br>Once you have a little bit of a base to understand try toying with some very simple things. "if" statements, loops, variables, your first function, etc.<br><br>From there you have everything to need to delve deeper. Come up with a very simple concept that is interesting to you. My first example was an etch-a-sketch program that used 2 keys to simulate the left knob and 2 more to simulate the right. Implementing something like that will teach you the next 2 most important things: what you don't know (how do I make something show up on the screen?) and how to find the answer (browse through the commands under related to graphics in the blitz documentation...)<br><br>From there look towards making something else you're interested in that's a little more complex, a very very simple game like pong. This process repeats the above of discovering what you don't know (how can I tell when the "ball" hits the "paddle"?) and how to find the answer (hint: collision detection...)<br><br>The reasons I stress finding things you are interested in, and that you like at each stage is this makes it MUCH more fun, and you go a lot faster. Are you more interested in video games or databases right now? Whichever it is is going to give you more drive to focus on it.<br><br>You get better by constantly pushing yourself. AI, sound, storage, networking, data management, 3D, etc. are all just "ok how do I do this?" followed by extensive investigation to find the answer. The more you do it the better you get at finding answers and the faster you learn new things. My first year of programming I learned basic concepts of logic flow, simple variables, and a graphics system I borrowed from a friend and I made a game with terrible graphics, piss poor AI, and it was among the most fun I've ever had. This year I picked up raw OpenGL and Java on the side to continue expanding one existing project while starting 2 others. Your scope grows as your skills grow. Always stretch but keep it within reason or you'll get discouraged. and stay interested or it becomes "work" and you'll walk away. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
