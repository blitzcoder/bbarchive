First of all you should study C, then C++(And you should understand the differences between C and C++, and why C would be more useful in some cases depending on the application). Then you should get to know and use Java, C#, PHP and every language you can get you hands on.<br><br>While you're eagerly studying all of this you would be well advised to look into code layout and documentation. Also look into code management, application design and software testing.<br><br>When you've learned and used these languages, know all about how to make well designed, maintainable code and how to debug that code, then you've (hopefully) developed an understanding of programming in general and about the merits of each language. <br><br>Hiring someone is trivial, many companies use external consultants just to screen the programmers from the hopefulls. Your application will be competing against seasoned veterans who know everything you know + 250 percent and have many years of experience. When you're hired, the real process starts. They have to train you to be part of a team, to deliver, to plan and manage your own time and to make quality code.

Part <br>&gt;of it has something to do with Directx, OpenGL, etc. It's <br>&gt;just today's industry. If not C++, than what do honestly <br>&gt;think today's games are programmed in?<br><br>Most game development is about licensing an engine and then hiring 25-50 people to do story, graphics and most importantly scripting using a scripting engine built into the engine. So most of the programming that goes into making a game is really done in a scripting language and only minor tweaks of the actual engine is done in C++.<br><br>&gt;Maybe C++ is useless to you guys for making independent <br>&gt;games, but it's my future in programming so I must know <br>&gt;what is best for my next change. I suppose it'll be <br>&gt;Truevision3D. <br><br>Knowing the language is not understanding it. You can go to any internet forum and see a sig saying 'knows C,C++,C#, Java, Delphi, VB, PHP and SQL), but the person has never actually used that knowledge for anything useful, couldn't finish a project if it saved his life and applies the same solution to every problem he is faced with.<br><br>Knowing C++ is good, but it won't give you a headstart over a VB programmer with imagination and a poodle. Focus on learning to program rather than what language you program in. Write the same program in various languages and note the benefits and burdens of each. The basic elements are the same, conditions, branches, loops etc. so programming really comes down to how the programmer solves a problem in the most efficient way.<br><br>EDIT: <br>And in reference to your subject - You're never done with any language you've learned. <br><br><br>Andy <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
