This value would then be added to the X or Y position of the object.<br><br>Of course though this means that the movement is not smooth - with a maximum velocity of 5 you could potentially have the object skipping 5 pixels at a time which might achieve the aim but it doesn't look smooth.<br><br>Can someone explain how this should be handled?  I have a feeling it involved the 'tweening' that i've heard mention of elsewhere but i'm not sure how to implement this in my code.<br><br>All comments appreciated.<br><br>Many thanks <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I just can imagine three faults why it's not looking smooth:<br><br>1) when you run it in windowed mode then your OS keeps the frame rate down (depending on the os it's something between 25 and 40Hz).<br>2) your routines are too slow. Which can easily happen. Then you have to optimise your code.<br>3) Your timer is not set correctly. Just try to measure the FPSs and see how fast your programme really runs. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you're running with vsync enabled (which I recommend btw) it'll be limited to your refresh rate.  60Hz is common which will make your game appear to be running in slow motion or depending on how you handle the 0.01 timing, make it skip and jump while it tries to stay inline with a lower frequency.  I don't agree with eplosives point (1) as it's quite possible on the right hardware to run windowed or fullscreen blitzmax apps at 1000 frames per second if vsync isn't enabled.<br><br>If you know the update delta time (0.001 * milliseconds_elapsed, whether milliseconds_elapsed is fixed or fluctuating) increasing velocity is as simple as velocity :+ (100.0 * framedelta).  Which increases it by 100 pixels for every full second (one second takes it to 100, 2 seconds takes it 200 and so on).  Movement is then X :+ velocity.<br><br>The above is constant linear acceleration of 100 pixels per second.  If you want to do real acceleration (which is a function of time^2) keep a track of the time it's been applied, and use that to work out how much to increase velocity..<br><br>age :+ framedelta<br>velocity :+ (9.8 * age * age) ' hey it's gravity: m/s^2.  We should have a terminal velocity too ;)<br><br>If velocity is 5 pixels per frame then so be it, it happens, and it can be smooth if the timing system plays nice.<br><br>Cheers<br>:) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
