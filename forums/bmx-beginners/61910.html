But I've grown attached to things like putting functions in types.  <br><br>Also I've learned some new things, and improved my coding style because of it.  I still do not subscribe to the OOP EVERYTHING philosophy, but some OOP things can help you origanize things better.  I'm still working on refining this new style though.  One issue that has come up is keeping track of where I am loading my graphics.  If I have a loading screen for example, I have to load the loading screen graphics befroe everyhtign else so they're loaded in the loading type.  But then there are things like the main game graphics which get loaded in the graphics type.  Maybe they should be loaded in a main game type, but there is none.  There is a fruit type though, and that loads the graphics for the fruit, but the fruit are just one item in the game.  So I have some gameplay related things being loaded in their specific types and others being loaded in my general graphics type which isn't really geared towards that, and it's a mess.  As I add more stuff to the game though, that stuff gets more refined and in the future hopefully, I'll know the right places to put the stuff in the first place to make the close as clean and maintainable as possiblee.<br>  <br>And speaking of maintainable, superstrict has been a big help in making sure I declare all my variables.  I'm very careful with my code as it is, and not declaring my variables wasn't generally a big issue for me, but other people who use my code would sometimes delcare a variable with the same name as a global I'd used and this would cause a problem.  It didn't happen often to my knowledge, but now that's not really an issue.<br><br>I'm still not entirely happy with some of the things Mark chose to do in the language but it is definitely an improvement over previous versions of Blitz.  At least for the pros.  It might be a bit too complicated for beginners now.  I myself took a month to really get the hang of it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
