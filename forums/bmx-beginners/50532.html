Namely some of the 2D functions which seem to be missing (or I have missed). The most annoying for my little programs being the lack of a  "DrawImageRect" command and the ability to call "GetColor x,y" to obtain colour details, between the two of these commands, they formed the backbone of many of my simple 2D programs. It seems that these micky mouse programs are going to have to be writen from the ground up, which isn't exactly a great surprise, but a shame none the less.<br><br>However, this experiance with these realy quite small, fairly modular, programs has got me thinking. In the run up to the release of blitz max, I lost count of the number of people putting off releases for half/nearly finished products saying that they would wait and port them to blitz max.<br><br>Judging by my (limited) experiance, I'd hate to have to port a program of any significant lenght or one that included a little spagetti code within it...<br><br>So my questions are :<br><br>Has there been any major port from BlitzBasic 2D or otherwise to max?<br><br>If so, how many? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Yes, they have a function titled "DrawImageRect".
