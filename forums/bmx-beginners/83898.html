It is going to get locked and he is not going to get his question answered.<br><br>@Uber Jase,<br>to answer your question, in my opinion, I did find use for it and it is ok. his latest release is a bit hard to follow but if you are willing to get help from him through emails, I guess he can clear all of your issues.<br>I personally prefer if demos are included.  He included them in previous releases but where lacking in his latest one. it normally wouldn't make much difference but sence he change the engine to a point where my program wouldn't run anymore, it made an inpact. I had a hard time recoding it to fit the new way of doing it.  <br>I haven't used sprite candy so I can't make that comparison. I have heard great things about sprite candy but not much about about sswift sprite system but that is just personal experience. SSwift has a thread where he tries to find out what people are doing with his sprite system here:<br> http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?"topic=78307#878329<br>  but it looks like part of it got lost. I guess if you are an intermediate or beginner programmer it is really good to have as it does help. in reality, what might be good for one might not be good for other so the only way to find out is to try it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
