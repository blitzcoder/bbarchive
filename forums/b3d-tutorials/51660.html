Map geometry is only the most basic kind of information stored in a 3D World Studio scene. There's much more useful information besides just triangles and vertex positions. By accessing this data in the loaded .b3d mesh, we can add particle emitters, start positions, water, visibility culling, and just about anything else you can think of. <br><br><b>Files</b><br><br><a href="http://www.leadwerks.com/files/AdvancedSceneLoadingInBlitz3D.zip" target="_blank">AdvancedSceneLoadingInBlitz3D.zip</a><br><br><b>LoadWorld()</b><br><br>When loading a .b3d scene, we are going to replace LoadMesh() with a new command, LoadWorld(), which we will write right now. We start by loading the .b3d, and returning if the scene fails to load. We use LoadAnimMesh() instead of LoadMesh() because LoadMesh() would collapse all objects into a single mesh, which we don't want: <br><br><pre class=code>Function LoadWorld(file$) 
map=LoadAnimMesh(file) 
If Not map Return</pre><br>Now we create a world pivot, with a number of child pivots and meshes. Each child is going to contain a certain type of object. <br><br>-The meshes entity will be parent to all map meshes found in the scene. <br><br>-The renderbrushes entity will be a collapsed mesh used for drawing all brush objects. <br><br>-The collisionbrushes entity will be a parent to all brush objects, and will be used for collision and picking. Since the renderbrushes entity is used to draw all the brush objects, the collisionbrushes entity will not be drawn. Blitz3D renders faster with single surfaces, which the renderbrushes object creates. However, separate objects are faster to run collision on, because Blitz3D performs a box test on each object. By storing the render and collision brush objects separately, our game will be most optimized for Blitz3D. <br><br>-The solidentities entity is parent to all solid entities. Solid entities are brushes or meshes that have a special classname. They can be used to create a trigger field the player steps into, an area filled with water, and lots of other things. Here, we will use a solid entity to create an invisible collision object. <br><br>-The pointentities entity is parent to all point entities in the scene. Point entities are placed in the editor, and can be lights, sound emitters, particle emitters, enemies, or just about anything else you can imagine. Here, we will use a point entity called a "playerstart" to tell our program where the camera should start out. <br><br><pre class=code>world=CreatePivot() 
meshes=CreatePivot(world) 
renderbrushes=CreateMesh(world) 
collisionbrushes=CreatePivot(world) 
pointentities=CreatePivot(world) 
solidentities=CreatePivot(world) 
EntityType collisionbrushes,COLLISIONTYPE_BRUSH</pre><br>Now we are going to go through the scene limbs and load each limb according to what type of object it is. Each limb in the scene has properties stored in the entity name. The properties are stored as a keyname and a keyvalue, like this: <br><br>classname=light <br>range=800 <br>color=255 255 255<br><br>By using the KeyValue() function, we can return a keyvalue for any entity, for whatever keyname we indicate: <br><br>keyvalue$=KeyValue$( entity, "classname" )<br><br>By selecting each entity "classname" we can determine what type of object each node in the scene is. Mesh objects will be parented to the meshes entity. Brush objects will be added to the renderbrushes entity for drawing, then parented to the collisionbrushes entity for collision: <br><br><pre class=code>For c=1 To CountChildren(map) 

node=GetChild(map,c) 
classname$=Lower(KeyValue(node,"classname")) 
DebugLog "Loading "+Chr(34)+classname+Chr(34)+"..." 
Select classname 
	Case "mesh" 
		EntityParent node,meshes 
		c=c-1 
		EntityType node,COLLISIONTYPE_MESH 
	Case "brush" 
		AddMesh node,renderbrushes 
		EntityType node,COLLISIONTYPE_BRUSH 
		EntityAlpha node,0 
		EntityParent node,collisionbrushes 
		c=c-1</pre><br>Finally, we load our point and solid entities. We are only going to create one point and one solid entity. You will want to expand this to handle all types of entities in your engine: <br><br><pre class=code>
	;Invisible collision brush 
	Case "field_hit" 
		EntityParent node,collisionbrushes 
		EntityType node,COLLISIONTYPE_BRUSH 
		EntityAlpha node,0 
		c=c-1 

	;Camera start position point entity 
	Case "playerstart" 
		angles$=keyvalue(node,"angles","0 0 0") 
		pitch#=piece(angles,1," ") 
		yaw#=piece(angles,2," ") 
		roll#=piece(angles,3," ") 
		If cam 
			PositionEntity cam,EntityX(node),EntityY(node),EntityZ(node) 
			RotateEntity cam,pitch,yaw,roll 
			EndIf</pre><br>We finish off the function by exiting the Next loop, freeing the original loaded mesh, and returning the world pivot: <br><br><pre class=code>
		End Select 
	Next 
FreeEntity map 
Return world 
End Function </pre><br><b>Seeing it in Action</b><br><br>Open the example.3dw scene in 3D World Studio. Select the large box covering the map meshes and open the properties editor. You will see that this brush has a classname of field_hit. It also has two parameters, CastMeshShadows and CastBrushShadows, each set to 0. This will prevent the brush from casting a shadow when lights are calculated. <br><br><a href="http://www.leadwerks.com/developer/images/c/cc/Blitz3dentities01.jpg?" target="_blank">http://www.leadwerks.com/developer/images/c/cc/Blitz3dentities01.jpg?</a><br><br>There are three point entities in the scene. Two are lights, and one is a playerstart entity. The angles property indicates the orientation of the camera: <br><br><a href="http://www.leadwerks.com/developer/images/6/68/Blitz3dentities02.jpg?" target="_blank">http://www.leadwerks.com/developer/images/6/68/Blitz3dentities02.jpg?</a><br><br>Open the LoadWorld.bb program and run it. The camera will start at the position and orientation of the "playerstart" entity. The camera will collide with the brush walls, and with an invisible collision brush covering the meshes. Collision will not be run on the more complex mesh objects. <br><br><b>What Other Entities Are There?</b><br><br>Whatever you want! This tutorial has shown you how to place entities in the editor and load them in Blitz3D. It's up to you to decide what "kinds" of objects your engine will handle. Add a particle emitter, a monster or a block of water. Use the KeyValue() function to return any parameters you want to set in the editor. Your imagination is the only limit. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You don't have to understand a function to use a function. You only need to know how to use it. <br><br>So. Try using the LoadWorld() as is. Then, experiment. <br><br>Basically, whats going on is each type of entity in your .b3d export (from 3dws) is getting loaded into Blitz3D with different properties. Those properties should have already been defined in 3dws (try selecting an object and hitting 'Shift+Enter'. Class is the 'classname')<br><br>As for the functions that weren't explained, KeyValue() and Piece(), here is what I know: The 'playerstart' entity has an 'angles' property. In order to use the playerstart info in 3dws, 'KeyValue' returned the key values of the 'angles' property into the variable 'angles$'. It also set default values incase there weren't any already for the 'angles' property. Then, since now all three values are in a string (in the variable 'angles$'), you use peice() to seperate each value and assign them to different variables.<br><br>I hope that clears up what those two functions are for.<br><br>As for the other stuff... well I'm not sure how you can code in 3 different assembly languages but not understand a for loop and a switch statement. Look up "CountChildren()" and "GetChild()". The for loop continues until the variable 'c' equals the total children of the world pivot (an entity that is the parent of every entity in your .b3d file). The select statement (aka switch statement) just filters through the 'classnames' (a property assigned to every object in 3dws) of different types of entities you have in your .b3d file until it finds the 'classname' that the variable 'node' (which is the current entity in the loop) points to. <br><br>Well then... I might as well just write a tutorial myself...<br><br>Hope this helps to everyone struggling with this. I was one of you only a short time ago. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I am not really interested in this per sae.<br><br>Just the detail of the output from 3dws porting to B3d<br><br>B3D seems to use LoadMesh and AniMesh functions.<br><br>Animesh is used as the basis for 'Loadworld' because it loads the data un-collapsed. I believe really from 3DWS perspective they use it because it loads the mesh structure (Unaltered), and has a facility for the carrying other info.<br><br>However am I right in thinking, that 3DWS is depending on this to populate the structure in its bespoke way?<br>The loadworld function is then used to strip and reassemble the packed data, to construct a static environment and textures and faces.<br><br>This however according to the B3D manual is not the way Animesh was used. I believe you save it in a format for such as an animated mesh model, and action it to animate.<br><br>Again perhaps I am confused, hence for the asking of explanation.<br><br>In brief my understanding is3DWS is using a feature of a language B3D Animesh, in an unorthodox way to pack its created information. Hence the need for the 'Loadworld' routine to unpack this info.<br><br>The problem for me is, Blitz forum is not really the key place for this explanation. It should have come from the creators of 3dws, however they send user to blitz forum for explanations. This is why I was a bit unhappy. <br><br>If you create a piece of software that acts as a parasite. I feel it is your responsibility to detail its use for the host product, not the reverse.<br><br><br>In fact from my brief experience on this site. It seems a lot of games look the same, different graphics maybe?<br><br>But perhaps it’s because people are using things. Borrowing without looking at the main concepts, and why before borrowing.<br><br>In the early days, you couldn't borrow so quick without the pain of understanding stuff. That I believe is why there was a lot more creativity and variance. Now the Games market has dried up. Because people and companies are taking that approach, nick sub routines..dont understand it. Use it till you cannot get anymore out of it. Then wait for another release...<br><br>Sorry but that’s just not me.<br><br>In music most of the famous hits, did not come about when musicians seriously sat down with an intent to create a hit. It is usually happens accidentally, during a creative process. During the pain! you find other ..Perhaps better ways of doing things.<br><br>Anyway this is just an opinion, and not a flame war starter.<br><br>Thanks for your help people<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Thanks again <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
