I have decided to release a few of these libraries since can be very useful to many of you, I'm sure.<br><br><br><a href="http://www.alsbonsai.com/john/GameScript1.zip" target="_blank">Download GameScript Here</a><br><br>GameScript SDK provides you with the power to compile and execute embedded script programs within your BlitzBasic application. Embedded scripts can be used as plug-ins, modable content, and much more. GameScript supports multi threading scripts, which allows you to run more than one script at the same time in your application.<br><br>GameScript scripts are normally filed as “.gs” files and will be automatically compiled when necessary. When distributing your application, you can hide your script source code by simply deleting the “.gs” files, leaving the remaining compiled GameScript executables (.gsx). The “.gsx” files will exist for each “.gs” file after they have been run once (which automatically calls the GameScript compiler) or have been compiled manually with the GameScript compiler. This is extremely handy also if you have developed a plug-in for an application that utilizes GameScript, and you would like to protect your source code.<br><br>GameScript has very few limitations and is a full-featured programming language, including features such as custom data types, standard flow control, and an optimizing compiler. Some of the features GameScript includes are:<br><br>• Easy to use structured programmer-friendly BlitzMax-style language syntax<br>• Easy-to-use programmer interface<br>• Custom data types<br>• Functions with recursion support<br>• Local, Global, Constant, and Static variables<br>• A fast compiler<br>• Ultra-fast multi-threading virtual machine<br>• Protect your scripts – Since GameScript natively runs only GameScript executables (.gsx), there's no need for your script source code (.gs) to be included with your final distribution<br>• Automatic compile management – GameScript source code (.gs) is compiled to GameScript executable (.gsx) only when changes have been made.<br><br>Note: Funtion overloading, which might be mentioned in the manual, does not currently exist in this version of GameScript. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You could use it to write quests, AI, etc. Anything that you don't want to directly hard-code into your EXE (like mission events in a tank game, for example), you can put in a script.

The pcodes are read by the virtual machine and executed (the VM actually can run scripts at 1/3 of Blitz's speed, which is surprising considering that it is a VM).<br><br>The only way to interface the script to your code is through functions which you add to the scripting language through "GameScript Functions.bb"<br><br>P.S. While your program can't call GameScript functions, it can run GameScripts whenever you want. And since GameScripts are pseudo-threaded, you can easily construct a event-based script system that executes certain scripts when events trigger. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The whole single-line If..Then parser was wrong - it assumed that a single line If..Then statement is "If condition then statement1 [else statement2]", and didn't consider that there might be multiple statements.

You could easily make a temporary file system that feeds console input into the script engine, but then you'd only have access to Blitz functions (the ones you add to "GameScript Functions.bb"). You could work around this, though, by adding all your scripted functions after each console input, but will lead to increased compile times (although the compiler is reasonably fast). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
