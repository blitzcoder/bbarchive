That's where I hit my snag.<br><br>Particles are defined as a type, with positional, velocity, colour and time-to-live elements. When a particle is created, it is given a time-to-live number of milliseconds (actually, I'm just using game updates because I've not implemented delta time yet). When all particles are updated, the time-to-live is decreased, if it hits 0 the particle is not displayed.<br><br>Simple.<br><br>Simple until I want to create a new explosion effect and we already have 50K particles active. The elegant solution is to reassign the oldest (i.e. lowest time-to-live) particles to the new explosion. This would give the best visual experience using the limited number of particles available.<br><br>Doing this with custom types is proving difficult, though I'm sure it can be done very simply.<br><br>I'm sat here thinking that I should scrap the almost-elegant custom type approach and implement the whole thing using data stored in banks. I can't use arrays because the maximum number of particles in use needs to be dynamic.<br><br>Has anyone got a neat solution, or can at least bandy around some arguments for and against a particular method, or alternative way of thinking?<br><br>** EDIT: The prooblem with things at the moment is, each new effect reassigns particles, but always starts reassigning the first created particle. This is because when I for-each through the particles to update+display them, the type 'pointer' ends up back at the last particle.<br><br>What I could do with is a way to go to the <i>n</i>th particle. I'm guessing that the way things are stored internally is a linked-list, which precludes using anything other then a for-next to step through from the first particle to the desired one.<br>Code...<br><br><pre class=code>

You'd think that would be the thing to solve it, but it ends up back at the same old problem; how to address a particular particle.<br><br>A <i>perfect</i> system would be to maintain a list of particles, sorted by time-to-live. Of course, that would end up using more CPU resources than rendering a few thousand extra particles, which is counterproductive. The only real way to implement that would be to store particles in a binary tree, rather than a linked-list. Even then I don't think it would be a workable method.<br><br>A <i>reasonable</i> system would be to store an array of particles, particle[0 - 50000] for example. All I'd have to do then is maintain an index as to which particle was the last to be assigned to an effect and to assign new particles cyclically around the array. It wouldn't be perfect, because there may be some long-lived particles 'overwritten' before some short-lived ones. Visuals would probably be acceptable though.<br><br>The only problem there is; you can't redimension an array. It's also not an elegant way of doing things (and therefore, not a <i>good</i> way IMHO).<br><br>What I'm trying to think of is a method whereby the oldest (or expired) particles get reassigned first, not by some complex sorted index, but by an underlying aspect of the implementation. As an analogy, you're designing an airlock door and need to ensure safety. Instead of putting in triple-redundancy and fail-safes, you use a rotating cylindrical chamber with only one opening. It can't fail and it works because there's no way it <i>can't</i> work.<br><br>Most people writing a particle system would perhaps not maintain an upper limit on the number of particles in use. Or they would put a hard limit in and would just not render any particles past that limit (new effects would not show up). This just isn't going to cut it for my game though, so I'm going to spend a lot of time getting this right :)<br><br>I'm going to crack out the pen and paper tomorrow and try to model the problem at its lowest level. Perhaps a solution will present itself. I'm going to go away now and sleep on it... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

To do this, you'd need to set an upper limit to a particle's time-to-live.  A "cyclical" array of pointers to particles would index them by their time of death.  Then, when you need to insert a particle, it's O(1) to find the correct place to put it:<br><br>insertion_point.particle = next_particle_to_die_after((current_frame + this_particle\ttl) MOD max_ttl)<br><br>Null would mean that no particle will be dying after that time and that any new particles should simply be added to the end of the list.  Every frame, you'd need to clean the leading edge of the array by setting next_particle_to_die_after((current_frame + max_ttl) MOD max_ttl) = Null <i>(yes, i know that math's redundant, but i think it better shows the intent.)</i>  Also, when you insert a particle, you'll need to update the relevant pointers in the next_particle_to_die_after array.<br><br>Ugh.  I hope this makes sense.  I'll see if I can code up a simple example later, as I have to run out the door now.<br><br>A totally different approach would be to replace the oldest particle in each effect in turn.  This would even out where the particles came from.  This method would likely involve each effect having its own linked list of particles.  Effects could have "priority" values so that you might remove particles from less important effects either more often than (or in place of) particles in more important effects.  You might also decide to favour removing particles from effects which use more particles than other effects.  This method assumes that each effect creates particles with the same time-to-live. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

</textarea><br><br>It basically works by creating an array of particle linked lists with a global index variable (now_index) that represents the current frame. This variable is incremented (and cycles back to 1) every update. All particles in the currently indexed list have expired and so get freed.<br><br>So, to create a particle with a 10 frame lifespan, we simply add it to the list 10 positions ahead of where now_index is referencing. Thus, it takes now_index 10 updates/increments before it reaches this list and frees all the particles contained within.<br><br>Now, when we run out of particles and want to use the oldest one, we can simply walk forwards from now_index until we hit a list containing a particle. Note that by "oldest one" I mean the particle with the shortest time left to live. This may not necessarily be the particle that has been in existence for the longest time.<br><br>This system could be converted to work with delta timing, I think, but may not be great in that situation since you'd have to have linked list for each millisec of MAX_PARTICLE_LIFE.
