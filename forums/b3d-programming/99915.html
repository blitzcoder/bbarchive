He seems to be OK with Blitz just as a hobby for now.  There's something very liberating about programming, especially this kind of programming.  We don't know how old he is, or what his potential really is.  It can start out as a hobby, and who knows from there?<br><br>I would only suggest that if Yue wants to be hired as a computer programmer at some point in the future, the big languages seem to be Java, C# and still C++ to some extent (C++ particularly in games).  None of those are BASIC languages like Blitz.  People seem to start out with C and then move to one of those three languages (all are based on C and most books/courses tend to assume you know C even if they don't say so). <br><br>However, for indie programmers the trend is toward portable devices, and there's no reason a person couldn't make a hit with something like Monkey or Corona, or BlitzMax (miniB3D? not sure what those folks are using now).  <br><br>I know that those who hire programmers tend to prefer self-taught programmers over the computer science degrees, assuming the same level of knowledge, because the self-taught ones are so much more motivated.  I know two top programmers ($100,000+/year) who never took a computer science class (as far as I know) although they did graduate college (one has a film degree, the other linguistics).<br><br>There are software companies in Colombia, and if Yue has a passion for it and puts in the effort needed to learn there's no reason he couldn't be successful.  That's my point.  Don't forget developers often start out with testing jobs and such.  Of course every society has social class issues and all that stuff that Yue has to take into account.<br><br>I'm blathering! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
