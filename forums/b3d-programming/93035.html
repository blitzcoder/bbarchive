While GOTO is a NOGO in a wide area of professional Programming, we should not forget that we're BASIC Programmers. Why are we BASIC programmers? Because testing, editing and runnig code is much faster than any other System. Hit F5 and you know if it'S gonna work almost immediately, where all the other language compilers that I ever tried in the past ()eg. vc++, will make a big deal out of the slightes hello world program, and if you once got everything right in your code, includig access paths to includes, linker etc. it still takes seconds to compile a 1 liner.<br><br>If you for exampe try to design something in 2D, you can do that quickly in BASIC.<br><br>So I think GOTO can be useful, especially for blockmarks. When you want to try two variants of some 2D commands, GOTO is the quick solution. You could also put them in functions, but it's already more work and you got to declare Globals and locals to make it work. These are simple things that you want to try in seconds, or skip it using GOTO, compare and finally delete all but the stuff you like.<br><br>I do agree, GOTO should not be part of your Program Flow Structure.<br><br>Nevertheless, you may use it here:<br><pre class=code>
for x=0 to 100
 for y=0 to 100
  for z=0 to 100
   ...
   if b=1 then goto .myexit1
  next
 next
next
.myexit1
</pre><br><br>But you can also do this the "legal" way:<br><br><pre class=code>
for x=0 to 100
 for y=0 to 100
  for z=0 to 100
   ...
   if b=1 then exit
  next
  if b=1 then exit
 next
 if b=1 then exit
next
</pre><br><br>where in my opinion version B is not only longer and slower, but also uglier. Probably RETURN could be used to do something like that, but then you need to put the for loop into a function, which would only complicate the structure.<br><br>So my conclusion is: there may be uses for GOTO, but they are really limited. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
