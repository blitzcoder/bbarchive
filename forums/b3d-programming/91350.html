That means it should be receiving periodic meaningful updates. Thus, the "just use BMax" argument could be made to officially discontinue B3D, but not to fail to update it if it is officially supported.<br><br>Back to the topic; I do think collections would enhance the usage of custom types. <br><br>In a nutshell; when you create a type, you are defining the fields of that type but you are also creating a single linked list of instances of them, which you iterate through using after and before.<br><br>Collections allow you to create additional linked lists of them, something like:<br><br><pre class=code>
type baddie
   field strength
end type

global team1.baddie=CreateCollection(baddie)
global team2.baddie=CreateCollection(baddie)
global team3.baddie=CreateCollection(baddie)
</pre><br><br>.. or something similar.<br><br>Of course, they would still be reachable in the original list; each list is independent.  This would lead to:<br><br><pre class=code>
type team
   field baddies.baddie=CreateCollection(baddie)

</pre><br><br>But once again, there's no standardization possible since it's solely down to the user to know whether oor not to expect an 8,16, 24 or 32-Bit value.<br><br>I did some work on this a while ago, in an attempt to optimise the reading/wrtiting some by the use of a 'Control Byte' which could contain information about the sizes, signs and so on of the following byte values<br><br>It's still a WIP and unfuinished as yet, but here's what I have so far:<br><br><pre class=code>
; WriteInt, Float and String always use the long byte 32-Bit notation.
; However, most Strings contain the standard ASCII set which only requires 8 bits.
; Many Floats or Integers may also be in a small range, that do not require the space of 32-bits.
; However, generally, there's no guarantee of knowing how many bytes worth of information should be attributed to a particular
; value.
; WriteByte, conversely, ONLY writes a single 8-Bit byte. So it cannot alone be used to store values greater than 255.

; Consider the following integer: 42372
; This value requires at least 2 Bytes (16-bits) 

; Bits '3', '7', '8', '10', '13' And '15' are set To 1 (Note: Bit '0' =1 Bit 15 is the 16th Bit)
; 4 + 128 + 256 + 1024 + 8192 + 32768 = 42372

; If taken separately, as 8-Bit Bytes, Byte 1 (Bits '0'-'7') would appear to equal:

;Byte 1
; Bits '3' and '7' set to 1
; 4 + 128 = 132

;Byte 2
; Bits '8', '10', '13' And '15' set to 1 (or, Bits '0', '2', '5' and '7' considering Byte 2 as an 8-Bit Byte)
; 1 + 4 + 32 + 128 = 165

; So there is ambiguity. Are we looking at a 16-Bit value of 42372 
; OR
; a sequence of two 8-Bit values: 132,165

; This ambiguity is the main reason why the standard of 32-Bit notation (64-Bit values and quadwords are beond the scope of this document)
; is used, regardless of the size of the value represented, if it is accepted to always use 32-Bits, then any value in a range of (2^32)-1 (	4294967296   )
; can be represented without risk of confusion.
; so our above example of 42372 will be represented as a 4-Byte value as all 32-Bit values.
; The priority of bytes places the "Most Significant" Byte FIRST. 
; The "Most Significant Byte" will be the Byte with bits representing the HIGHEST values.
; The highest Bit value in 32-Bit notation, is Bit '31' (remember we number Bits from 0....) with a value of 2^31 (  2147483648  )
;Since our number really only utilises two of the 4-Bytes, the first 16-Bits (Bit '31' down to Bit '16') will be 0

; So, contrary to the displayed workings earlier, 42372 is shown by:

;BITS
; 31 30 29 28 27 26 25 24 23 22 21 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0
;  0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0  0   0   0   0   0   0  0   0  1   0   0   0   0  1  0  1  1   0  0  0  1  0  0  0

; It is these first two 'wasted space' bytes that this document and the code involved attempts to save.
; However, We still need a means of identifying how many Bytes a particular value needs.
; There is no other way to do this, unless your code ALWAYS knows precisely which range of values to expect and the order
; they appear in. This is impractical for most purposes.
; Therefore, we are going to use an extra Byte to make use of its 8 bits. There is more power available to us with the extra 8-bits
; awarded, besides identifying the number of bytes that follow, Since our 32-Bit processors only cope with numbers of 32-Bits at the most,
; We know that our extra Byte only needs to use Bit '0' and Bit '1', representing the possble number of Bytes to follow from 1 to 4.
; (Since we must use at least 1 Byte, a 0 value  of all Bits set to "0" can show 1 byte to follow, meaning we only need to count 0,1,2,3 for four possible Bytes)
; This then gives us 6 more Bits to 'play with'. But what else can we use them for?
; Well, an obvious first choice would be dealing with negative integers.
; We know we can represent values from 0 to (2^32)-1 but what if we wanted just to show -1 ?
; Traditionally, Byte values are considered "signed" or "unsigned" - "signed" meaning, they contain a Bit that represents a "sign", as in the "minus sign" ( - )
; Since this Bit is used for the "sign", it can no longer be used as part of the number itself.
; Here's an example of an 8-Bit "signed" Byte compared to an  "unisgned" version:

; SIGN 64  32   16   8   4   2   1
; 128   64  32   16   8   4   2   1

;Note how the HIGHEST value (Most Significant) Bit is used for the Sign (in this case, Bit '7'  = 128)

; Despite no longer having access to values Greater Than 127, we still have 255 possible values. How so?
; Well, let's see what happens when we use the "Sign" Bit:

; SIGN 64  32   16   8   4   2   1
;    0     0   1      0   1   0   0   1	=	32 + 8 + 1 		= 41

; If The "Sign" Bit is set to 0, then it is considered Positive. However, the same Byte with the Sign Bit set to 1 gives:

; SIGN 64  32   16   8   4   2   1
;   1     0   1       0   1   0   0   1	=	-	32 + 8 + 1 	= -86

; It doesn't make sense at first sight, how can 32+8+1 = -86 ?
; The answer is that the active Bits are actually added to -127
; Allowing for addition (setting Bits ON to 1)  to Increase, and subtraction (setting Bits OFF to 0) to Decrease the value as mathematically correct.
; The range of values then, for a "Signed" 8-bit Byte, are from -127 to + 127 including 0  to give our 255 possible values.

; So we now know that our special Added Byte will have at least 3 Bits in use:

; 128		64		32		16		8		4		2		1
;										     SIGN	 # BYTES  #BYTES

; What to do with the other 5 Bits?

There are threads on here showing various ways of hiding off-camera entities, or just triangles, to speed things up considerably.  Including that functionality natively would be excellent.<br><br>Built-in physics would be nice as well.<br><br>AddMesh() currently (i.e. last time I checked) creates a new surface each time.  It should leave that as an option.  (fyi: sswift has a workaround called AddMeshToSurface() in the archives)<br><br>HUD assistance a la Sprite Candy (not that fully featured necessarily, but you get my drift).  Every game needs it, so why not simplify it?  Especially useful would be bitmap font support and some fonts.<br><br>Several more primitives:  <br>   - Toruses (Tori?) <br>   - Pillbox (think of a sphere extended horizontally in x and z directions, with cylinder-style endcaps at the poles)<br>   - Capsule (cylinder with hemisphere endcaps)<br><br>These next two are not common as far as I know but I think they might be useful:<br>   - Sheets (just a grid like a terrain but that can be morphed any old way you want - there may be a better name than sheet out there)<br>   - partial cubes.  CreateCube() could have an optional flags argument that determines which faces exist.  Thus CreateCubes(0,128) = all faces exist (default), while CreateCubes(0,5) would have just two faces (1+4=5).  The 1 face might be z=1 and the 4 face might be y=1, or whatever.  This way people could assemble vast levels without loading anything or editing meshes directly by scaling these shapes appropriately.<br><br>If nothing else, lots of cool primitives is a great visual selling point for the product.  Marketing, people, marketing!<br><br>The goal here is not just to make life easier for us, but for the beginner.  The less research they have to engage in, poking around in the archives, etc., the more likely they are to stick with it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
