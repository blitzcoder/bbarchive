Worse is when you have an error that occours very infrequently, appears seemingly at random and does not appear to be triggered by any specific piece of code.  I'm stuck with one of those right now.<br><br>After a few hours looking at it I figure it can't hurt to have someone else maybe give some insight.<br><br>Here it is:<br>In my game several of my enemies use the same model (more are made through CopyEntity() ) the only difference being the brush they use and their size.  Whats happening is that the models appear to be switching between brushes seemingly at random and only for a second at most.<br><br>Notes:<br>Aside from the original PaintEntity during setup I don't Paint any of them in my main code loop.  So it would *seemingingly* be impossible for them to spontaneously change color (brushes) back and forth.<br><br>While I can't verify this, (it takes me a few minutes of testing before I can recreate the error) the error does appear to occour during camera angle shifts.  Note that the color change is a complete change from one to the other, there is no stretched lines that might occour if one had several, different colored entities all occupying the same space as a result of the z-buffer.  <br><br>So, does anyone have any idea what might cause this spontaneous shift in brush color?  I'll post some code snippets (I'm sure you don't want to look through the entire 3000+ lines).

The entity simply changes color comletely.<br><br>2) The enemies appear to change between several different patterns and I cannot seem to control when it occours.  For example one enemy I had and faced, it would switch between more than one texture.<br><br>The hardest part of this error is the difficulty I'm having replicating it.  It takes a few minutes of testing for the error to occur and it happens almost randomly.  Does anyone have any other ideas at what could trigger a spontaneous brush change?<br><br>@jumper - no, there wouldn't be a double spawn problem.  The SpawnEnemy() function I have positions enemies separately.  If there was a problem it would be due to having multiple entities in the same location all parented to the Offset Pivot so they got moved along the same, and thus being the same enemy for code purposes.  However given my forementioned reasons I doubt this is the case.<br><br>Thanks for your help... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Anyway as Glagar is essentially a hierarchy painting just the top level of that hierarchy is a bit suspect, as it will contain as many brushes as there are surfaces for each entity in the hierarchy, so maybe that is why you are not doing it like that. I guess I am missing something.   The brush system in blitz can be a bit of nightmare, what with entity brushes and surface brushes on the actual mesh and of course the fact that exactly how they interact is not documented. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
