Beeps provided a couple of samples that (1) showed how to use TextToSpeech and (2) showed how to wait for voice activation and then return the input as a string.<br><br>I did a bunch of this stuff myself using BC++ a while back, but couldn't get it to recognise French phrases unless delivered in an american accent, so I gave up on it. When I returned to it a while later MS had gone heavily over to Server-based Speech applications and the whole MSAgent-based approach. It seemed to be a whole new ball game, so earlier libraries and code simply didn't work anymore.<br><br>I have just checked, and I have a folder I have named "Superceded Beeps SAPI" in my decls folder, so maybe an earlier version of the dll might still work. email me if you want a copy of that folder. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
