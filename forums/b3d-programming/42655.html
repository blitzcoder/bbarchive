For now, it's rather small, but there's not much content in it yet (just a 30% finished engine and one 50% finished area). My current calculations show that the finished product will be 100 to 200 mb in size (that is if I don't zip it, but I doubt zipping it will make it much smaller because most of the size will come from png and ogg files, and these are already compressed).<br><br>Is this too much for a download? What's the maximum size a game should be before most people would say, forget it, I'm not buying it because it would take too long to download?<br><br>Opinions please. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The biggest bits tend to be music as 2 or 3 tunes will probably be 10mb or so. I would suggest making your game run with or without music and either have a music + game download and game download or a game download and an add music patch download. This way people can download the 20mb of game and if they want music they can download the additional xx mb if they want. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It all depends if you're aiming for "shareware" "small &amp; cutie" game genre where ppl expect simple and addictive games - which don't take ages to DL because those ppl probably don't have high speed connections. Hardcore Gamers otherhand might think that bigger the package, better the content... not true of course, but die-hard DOOM3 gamer probably don't want to DL small tetris-clone - even if it's under 1 meg.<br><br>And of course big game DLs will eat your bandwidth quicly if you're going to distribute it from your own website. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
