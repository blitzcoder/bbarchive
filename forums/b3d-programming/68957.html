Yes. To run an online RPG? Not hardly. Bob could get a debugger out, change his gold to 5,000,000 and no one knows he cheated. Frank could build a house, and as soon as he quits the game, his house disappears because there's no server to store any data on. You could save the data on his harddrive, but what if Joe burns Frank's house down after Frank turned his PC off and went to bed? Frank still has a save with the house on. But no one else does, so when they play next, they're all playing in a completely different world.<br><br>In short, no, it's completely unworkable to have an online RPG ( massively multiplayer or not ) without a server. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I took my Zelda TP like engine and have spent the last 3 months over hauling it for online only play.  I have crap equipment to host a game(especially a mmorpg).  My server is a dual 3.8GHZ Dell Precision workstation with 8gb memory.  My connection is on a dedicated 8meg connection.  I can only support about 200 people I believe.  You have no idea the work that is required in taking on a task like this.  You must have a server to store info, and even if you do... you will need to have error checking to prevent tampering and cheating.  Plus the numbers have to be exact.  Ive spent more time beta testing a combat system than anything just trying to make sure the numbers run correctly.  The slightest flaw and a level 1 new user with a luck of the draw big stick could walk around and own everyone hehe.  Anyways, youre on dialup, and you cant do it man.  Start small and work your way up to bigger things.<br><br>peace. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

"Why?" you ask? Simple. Frank trades with Joe and sells his +2 battleaxe to Joe for 120 gold. Bob is not online, and so his saved game has Frank owning a +2 battleaxe. About now, Bob signs in, and sees his old mate Frank. "What have you got to trade?" says Bob. Frank's inventory list comes up on Bob's screen and there's the +2 battleaxe which Frank no longer owns. Bob is intrigued and examines it, Boom, your game just crashed back to Windows because the item Bob examined is no longer in Frank's inventory.<br><br>And that's the most simple, basic example of the kind of problems you would get that I can think of. In reality, you would get much bigger, harder to find, more troublesome issues than that. You can't do an online RPG, period, because you can't have a persistent world. What you can do is have a fantasy world where people can meet up and chat, and perhaps have contests, play games, etc, but you have to approach it as a game which starts when the player signs in and finishes when the player signs out. You can't save data at when the player signs off, because anything you've saved could potentially be different when he signs back in again. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
