We should not be limitted from any discusions, its like BlitzBasic.com is turning into some sort of country club, with BlitzMax being the snobs and the existing customer base the slobs. Man Im going to watch cady shack, at least that was humor, this here is just tragic.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, Im a big fan of BRL for many reasons, but support has never been their strong point, IMHO.  If not for the user community and sites like BlitzCoder.com BlitzBasic and its ken would have vanished long ago.  Now, we see a wedge being hammered back into the heart of the community and its starting to smell like 2002 and 2003 all over again, when Mark and Idigicon were in their little spat.<br><br>Sorry if I sound a little envenomed, but when you slam doors in the faces of existing customers, who have purchased your products and convenced others to buy your products based on this very community, it does tend to hurt a little bit.  I was gung ho for BMAX before this, now? Im more like Screw BRL, if this is the attitude they have, Ill deal with Microsoft instead, at least they act like they care. Of coarse being a limp spined whimp, Ill be buying BMAX when its released for the PC.  God Im so pathetic!<br><br>BTW, the first person who says, "Well you should just use DBpro or something else and stop bothering Mark and company", will suffer horrors apon horrors.   Firstly, your hair will fall out, and then you will get fat, and then.... oh, wait thats me...  Well something will happen... and it wont be pretty... well not that pretty anyway... YOU PERV!!!<br><br>Seriously though, am I the only one who feels like Im being punished for:<br><br>1) Being a loyal BRL customer since 2002.<br>2) Not Owning a MAC, I mean how exactly do you get MAC out first when thats like a micro market with virtually NO existing customers, could you be any less loyal to your existing customer base if you tried? *Grrrr*<br>3) Im sure theres something. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I agree that there is no need to restrict the forum posting, infact I find the whole "no posting here unless you already own our products" quite a detterent, it stops potential customers from asking questions they feel they need to ask before making a decision.<br><br>On the other hand, it also keeps the community clear of "Can I make a Final Fantasy MMORG in Blitz with Halo grpahics?" posts.  So it's a two edged sword.<br><br>BTW, can I?  *no no dont answer!*<br><br>2. The stated intention was to protect you from the attrocities Mark may have committed in bodging BMax up intime for an xmas pay cheque, I believe it too.  In this respect, he's actually doing you a favour.  It's the poor buggers with Mac's I feel sorry for.<br><br>3. Yeah, your probably right. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I think it seperates the community too much.<br><br>A section for other languages in the blitzmax forum is cool as you can use languages like c/c++ with BlitzMax. I do however beleive that a section for other languages should have been added to the b3d and blitzPlus forums.
