This is the second collision problem i had, the other one was fixed (by luck)...I really need some help to figure out what i am doing wrong, i'd post a snippet of my code but i have no clue where the bug is so here it is:<br><br>www.razor.together4eva.com/SpaceInvader3D.zip<br><br>Problem: Cannot get enemy bullet to collide with player (hiddencube) hit 4 on the numpad to see the "hiddencube"... I'm trying to delete the enemy bullet type (the one he just hit you with) and the player bullet type (so you cannot fire back after your dead)... i'm also trying to get rid of the guns (freeentity player, freeentity player2) <br><br>The collision information is being held in the UpdatePlayer() function, on Row 93... <br><br>Please i really need help figuring out my collision bug... I also need to know what i did so i can prevent this bug in the future....<br><br>Thanks again for your help! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

And additionally: when both meshes are moving towards eachother, the collision may be missed, you maybe would need to set an Updateworld(0) in between the two movement commands. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Blitz collision system is build for moving to stationary entities.<br><br>Try and use the entitydistance command to detect the collision if the two entites are moving. You won't get a collisions response though, just check to see if entity A is close to entity B. Hope that helps :o) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Once i put a if player &lt;&gt; 0 or player2 &lt;&gt; 0 i had more errors in the main loop i was required to fix... also had some bugs for example you could shoot while the player was dead... had to fix those<br><br>4. The guns weren't hiding when they were hit, i had to add hideentity to get rid of em...<br><br>Now my collisions are working once again! thanks for your help! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
