However, one thing thats REALLY bothering is how drab the lighting looks. Don't get me wrong I wasn't expecting dramatic Cryengine lighting with bloom and HDR shaders with dynamic shadows. But I was hoping for at the least a little more.. contrast? This is slightly important to me as I was wanted to make a simple horror game. Think parts of Doom3 for example (http://www.gearlive.com/blogimages/Doom3.jpg). Of course I'm not expecting anywhere near those results, but I just want the bright vertex's (blitz3d uses per vertex lighting right?) to look bright and the dark ones to look.. well.. really dark!<br><br>Long story short, how do I make the lighting, and shading (shadowing, but not ACTUAL shadows) look sharper and more contrasted. I tried using SetGamma, but I didn't really get a noticeable effect.<br><br>Thanks! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

And Vertex-Coloring.<br><br>By using lightmaps you can <b>bake</b> (magic word) lighting information into textures, and by use of blending have those textures make your environment look dark, bright, anything you want. It's a solution to provide static shadows.<br>You need an application to generate your lightmap, such as <a href="http://www.melog.ch/slimshady/" target="_blank">SlimShady</a>. There are tons of ways to make lightmaps, so make sure to find out the way to make one with the modelling tool you're currently using.<br><br>And Vertex-Coloring. Well, there's no need to <a href="/posts.php?topic=89327#1014586" target="_blank">repeat myself</a>.<br><br>Also follows a couple of screenshots showing a Super Mario Sunshine level <a href="http://i56.tinypic.com/27zeusi.jpg" target="_blank">WITH</a> vertex coloring, <a href="http://i54.tinypic.com/x3gupd.jpg" target="_blank">WITHOUT</a> it, and with vertex coloring <a href="http://i55.tinypic.com/9foebo.jpg" target="_blank">ONLY</a>, just to show the effect (keep in mind that level is cut up appropriately so the polygons shape up to make those vertex-colored shadows).<br><br>These forums also have some threads on the subject: <a href="http://blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=90523" target="_blank">http://blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=90523</a> (from which I took those three mario sunshine screens).<br><br>EDIT: Since you can blend all kinds of shading applied to meshes, Lightmaps and vertex-coloring can be combined. So you have a lightmap giving you soft-shadows and vertex coloring shading the environment not only with dark colors but with other tones as well, to give some atmosphere and interest.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Get Gile[s] for free. It may take some time to become familar with it, but it's worth the troubles.<br>Slimshady was mentioned, but the latest version of it is in the zipfile "misc tools" that came with the CSP engine release V 10.0, see downloads on <a href="http://www.melog.ch/dropper/" target="_blank">http://www.melog.ch/dropper/</a> . To be honest,I don't think it's such a good lightmapper, I only use it to assemble multiple meshes to one mesh, position point lights in a Gile[s]-comaptible way, then export it for Gile[s], import it there and lightmap it with Gile[s]. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
