Plus typically the router at player 2+3's LAN would be discarding the incoming packets anyway unless there's a service / port forward / DMZ set up that forwards the packets to either player 2 or 3, but not both.<br><br>Alternatively, if you are using a server / client approach instead of peer-to-peer,  you can use a system where the clients can specify their own response ports upon joining the server. In that situation player 2 + 3 can each pick a different port which they can set up in their router to deliver to their respective computers. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Saves some host load maybe.<br><br>perhaps the game data needs to be sent to all players from all players to?  this would cut a middle man out and save off some milliseconds which would decrease some lag effects.<br><br>sorry doing some rambling in the thought process,  need to go modify some code :)<br><br>CTP <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You will only be able to set up a port forward in the router to a single LAN IP.<br><br>Actually, there may be another potential workaround:<br><br>- The server sees the incoming requests for clients to join the network<br>- If the server sees a 2nd request coming from the same IP as someone who already joined, it can deduce that that they are two users on the same LAN. <br>- when joining the server, have the computers also pass their local IP<br>- In case of duplicate, make sure that the first person connected is still there (no network hiccup causing a dupe, for example)<br>- If so, have the 1st PC act as a relay for the 2nd. Since you know the local LAN IP, you can send a notice to the first PC telling it to pass along info for PC #2 as well, and include the LAN IP of PC #2. <br><br>that way the server can still actively broadcast -- either directly, or indirectly through another players PC. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
