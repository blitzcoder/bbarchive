I love Blitz's simplicity and functionality, but being a C# developer, I cant stand the BASIC syntax. Im sure most of you are comfortable with it, but in case you are not I have developed a syntax parser and have developed a whole application using blitz, but in a different (more compact c-like) syntax. Its actually more like a cross between the two. You dont have to have your whole application in the same syntax as well. By naming your file blah.cx - the converter will automatically convert it, and if you keep it as blah.bb, then no conversion takes place.<br><br>If you want to test it out, let me know all i post it later. Debugging is very difficult at the moment. There is much to improve. Here is an example of the syntax:<br><br><pre class=code>

// include a bb file
#include &lt;a_file.bb&gt;
// include a cx (BlitzC) file
#include &lt;another_file.cx&gt;

/* 
 Use block comments like these
 to comment larger sections at a time.
*/

// declaring a type
type texture() {
	field cTexID$, cFilename$;
	field nWidth#, nHeight#;
	field nIndex;
}

// a while loop
while (condition = true) {
    if (this_condition = true) {
        debugLog("Condition is true.");
    } else {
        debugLog("Condition is false.");
    }
}

// standard function
function doStuff(cText$) {
    print("Printing " &amp; cText);
    for(1 to 10 step 2) {
        print("A line");
        // break out of any loop
        break;
    }

    // create an instance of a type
    tTex.texture = New texture;
    tTex-&gt;cTexID$ = "texture 1";
    tTex-&gt;cFilename$ = "a texture filename";
}



// you get the picture
</pre><br><br>You see it not real C, C#, Java or anything, but its sort of similar and faster to code. Anyways, let me know your thoughts....<br><br><a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/toolbox/toolbox.php?tool=92" target="_blank">http://www.blitzbasic.com/toolbox/toolbox.php?tool=92</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There are some aspects of C which are out dated, but the syntax certainly isn't. Take .net for example, you have VB.NET and C#. As with this, VB.NET and C# have almost the exact same functionality, but more programmers prefer to use C# as they are use to the syntax.<br><br>I personally see 'if (...) {' and '}' much easier to cope with then 'If ... Then' and 'End If'. Although its less verbose, its much neater (in my opinion). Anyways, im sure many others will share your opinion, but Im certain there are a couple who share mine.<br><br>Anyways, what is the harm in having an option, just like .net does?? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I have to laugh because I started out in Basic (at school), then learnt Pascal, then C and UNIX shell stuff, then VB, then Blitz! Kinda goes around in circles, a bit like history and life!<br><br>Not sure which I prefer really. I definetly have a soft spot for Basic because that was the first language I learnt and takes me back to my ZX81, Spectrum and (of course) Amiga days. It amuses me to know see Basic doing all the things the 'big, powerful' (sarcasm here) languages can do (well, most of them - kinda!). I see no disadvantage/advantage in any modern language (Basic, C or whatever), more down to prefference and 'what you know' these days.<br><br>I find that C type stlye makes me 'focus' more and tends to lead to more concise code. I find Basic allows me to be more creative, probably because its more 'natural' (at least to me). Hmmm, I guess Basic is perfect for Blitz when I need to be creative but if I was writing code for a nuclear power plant maybe C would be better (although doing it in Basic would somehow be very entertaining!!!).<br><br>Oh, and yes, a good IDE helps any language a lot. I purchased one especialy for Blitz (best not mention name or may get linched by all the other IDE's - lol - but it begins with P!!).<br><br>Rhy's Waffle Over!! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Nobody is forced to adopt this syntax style. All it does is convert one syntax to another. <br><br>For those interested, it is linked to the IDE - you name it BlitzCC.exe (and rename the original to BlitCCompiler.exe), it recursively searches all your includes and converts any BlitzC files (creates equivalent .bb files) then calls the actual compiler to compile it all. <br><br>Either way I dont use the default IDE anyways, I use UltraEdit for proper syntax highlighting.<br> <br>It appears many of you detest the c-style syntax. For me (and many others) C was my first language, then Java and now C# and VB.NET. I have written extremely large applications in VB and VB.NET for local government, utilities etc so im am use to the VB syntax - but to me it still dont like it.<br><br>I dont want Mark to spend time on syntax alternatives, I would rather him spend time on BlitzMax functionality.<br><br>Things like the following are possible:<br><br><pre class=code>

// != doesnt work yet so you have to use &lt;&gt; still

In fact -  some people would disagree completely.

There is no operator overloading, so "if (a=b) {" will be equivalent to "if a = b then". If "if (a=b) {" passes the blitz compiler, then it also passes the parser. Its pure preference. <br><br>I also get the impression that many think the whole c style syntax is out of date???? If so, why wasn't Java or C# (being two of the 'newest' commercial languages - along with few others) written with "if .... then ... end if".

C# = yourFunction( Rnd(1,200),Rnd(1,200) );

; NOPARSE areas are areas that do not get parsed by the translator

     Print "&gt; 0"
Else
     Print "&lt; 0"
EndIf

;; OPENPARSE

E% = Rand(4)
switch e

     case 1;
          print "case 1";

     case 3;
          print "case 3";
     case 4;

You can include files that won't be parsed by just including normal 'bb' files, but if you include a 'bc' file then it will be parsed accordingly unless you wrap the include instruction in the ;; NOPARSE/;; OPENPARSE tags.<br><br>So, operators like +=, -=, /=, *=, ==, !=, ++, --, etc. are useable, you have curly brackets, etc.  Inside of strings, in order to make it less of a pain in the fingers to add quotes, you can also use \" to escape the character (I recall escape being the proper term).<br><br>I'm considering defining a language sheet which lets you customize what these operators are exactly, but right now they're all hard-coded.<br><br>Also, opening brackets aren't used because, basically, they don't need to be used in these cases.<br><br>It's really fun writing this thing, might even help some people- who knows. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
