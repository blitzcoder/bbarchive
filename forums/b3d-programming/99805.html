Finding the "fourth vertex" of the quad was quite tricky.  The method I ended up using was simpler than I started with; A vertex index is exactly 2 * segments + 1 away from the vertex immediately above and below it on a Blitz3d sphere.  I just had to figure out which of the four corners was missing.<br><br>Initially I had tried to find it using VertexX(), VertexY(), VertexZ(), until I realized that it's not a 2D grid, those values will never line up, of course; it's a sphere!  I had gotten used to view the sphere as a 2D projection.<br><br>I've updated the demo, which sometimes seems to show the whole quad extruded, but other times the edges look pointy, but I think that's because other manipulations are happening too, which is fine.<br><br>There is now a pause key (P) which pauses the action (the ship movement) but NOT the camera, so you can travel around the frozen ships and inspect them up close.

I use it to split a ship into 'frags,' when it explodes.  So I clip the mesh once, then flip it over on the x axis and clip it again.  In theory this should result in two ship parts, but there's a bug in my side of it, because sometimes you can see the same feature (like the nose, say) in both frags.  Anyway it then does it once more on each frag, for a total of 4 frags (in each case the source frag is deleted.)<br><br>The only problem with this is it causes a noticeable lag, so I'm trying to manage the splitting by doing only one per frame. (It adds each frag-to-be-split to a type, then processes one per frame.)  Still, it's too slow on my machine.<br><br>In part this may be because I added a feature to the code to close off the hole formed by the split.  As it adds each new vert at the edge of the mesh, I add that vert to a type.  Then, I sort all the verts by yaw (using Atan2 on it's vertexX and vertexY).  Then I add triangles in the manner used on the Blitz3D cylinder primitives.  I usually works ok.<br><br>If I can't speed it up, I may have to resort to a cruder method of splitting the mesh, without adding verts to create a clean edge.
