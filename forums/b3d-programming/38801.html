When you walk under a light and you gun is illuminated with a fine shadow, or if you enter a room cast in the shadow of a spinning fan, or walk under a shaded tree, that is a projector.  Projectors now work on brushes, staticmeshes, terrain, as well as moving objects like players and vehicles.<br><br><i>Staticmeshes</i><br>Staticmeshes are collapsed into batches on a per-portalzone basis.  Fast line picking is possible with the optimized collision system.  Colliding staticmeshes are stored as non-merged instances of the mesh.  When a pick command is called, the engine first checks to see if the brush walls occlude the line of sight.  If the point is still visible, the engine then runs through and checks each staticmesh.  First, the engine checks the staticmesh's bounding box.  If the bounding box of the mesh occludes the line of sight, the engine then does a check on the actual mesh triangles.  With this technique, you very rarely even get to the level of checking mesh triangles, and if you do, it is unlikely that you will need to check more than one or two meshes.  The unoptimized line of sight check would have to check each triangle in the scene.  The optimized version eliminates perhaps 95% of the triangles.<br><br><i>Coronas</i><br>The optimized picking technique described above makes it possible to have large numbers of coronas, even in dense areas with lots of meshes.  Additionally, coronas are rendered as a single surface, so you can pretty much have as many as you want.<br><br><i>Portalzones</i><br>Portalzones store chunks of the map.  Visibility is automatically calculated by creating a list of adjacent or "touching" portalzones.  If the camera resides in one portalzone, that portalzone and all adjacent portalzones are shown.  Depending on the "iterations" value, all adjacent portalzones to those portalzones will be shown as well, for as many iterations as is indicated for that portalzone.  The default value is "2", which means you can set up your zones, and usually won't have to indicate any iterations value, unless you are doing major optimization.<br><br>Portalzone hiding and showing is used to efficiently deacticate graphical entities like coronas and emitters.  It provides an efficient way of culling players and other moving objects.  It also provides ridiculously optimized picking routines.  For example, if point A is in one portalzone and point B is in another non-visible portalzone, we can return False without even checking visibility between the two. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I don't expect a problem, because I have eliminated 95% of the Blitz commands.  The script programmer would use commands like LoadMap(), JoinServer(), SpawnPlayer(), etc., and then the basic math commands that every language has.  You wouldn't even be able to access mesh data or load file formats other than the special engine formats, so there is no chance of anyone replacing Blitz3D with this.
