To the point of this post.<br><br>  I have Program, design windows programs.<br>I have been wanting to make a program to store<br>Blitz3D Code in, But since I am not that familuar with Blitz<br>I am not sure as to the categories to add?<br><br>  Could someone assist in giving me some information on<br>The diferent categories based in Blitz3D?<br><br>  Example:<br>     Texture<br>     Camera<br>     Sprite<br>     exc......<br><br>  I was thinking about using everything in here as a Main:<br><a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/b3ddocs/command_list_3d_cat.php" target="_blank">http://www.blitzbasic.com/b3ddocs/command_list_3d_cat.php</a><br><br>  But was not sure if this would be appropriate or not.<br><br>Example: I made one for the programming language that I use.<br>Something like this:<br><br>   String<br>   Database<br>   Forms<br>   ActiveX<br>   Lines<br>   exc......<br><br>And within each of the categories.<br>There are [Fields] to add in such things as:<br><br>Title = What the source does / it's use<br>Author = Original &amp; Modifying Author<br>Description = Information on what it is used for.<br>Source Code = And of course, this is where you add in<br>              Your Source Code.<br><br>The program will save everything to an "Access Databse"<br>The Database will be formatted at a 2Gig capasity.<br>So chances of running out of run is slim to none.<br>Then again, hard core developers, can fill space very quickly.<br><br>  So if someone would like to assist me with the different<br>Categories, Then that would be extremely helpful.<br><br>  Once the program is completed. It will be a small fee<br>If you would like to purchase it, like $5.00 or something like that.<br>But that is later.<br><br>Thank You All;<br>Carrzkiss <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
