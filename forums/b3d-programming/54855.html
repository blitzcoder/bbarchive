I wonder what is the fastest HDR (aka Bloom aka Gloom) Filter emulation for Blitz3D?<br><br>Currently I am using a quad that covers the screen in blendmode 3, containing a blured 128 Texel texture that was made using Renderworld with a small CameraViewPort.<br><br>Rendering takes several millisecs, copyrect is pretty quick, somewhere around 1 millisecond. Bluring takes a few millisecs too, depending und the number of passes. I tried to optimize the burring hardly, but it still takes too much time IMHO.<br><br>Currently I do something like:<br><br>rgb(i,j)=((rgb(i-1,j) and $FEFEFF)shr 1) + ((rgb(i,j) and $FEFEFF)shr 1)<br> This will mix 2 Pixels 50:50. Since it doesn't need to split RGB, it's pretty quick, comparend to some other blur methods. I do this in 4 directions, the result is nicely blured.<br><br>But maybe there are faster methods?<br><br>I'd also like to know how to fix the flickerng that is caused by this method.<br>BTW. I cannot use more blur passes and a bigger texture, it would be too slow. This is not for a fancy FX Demo with a couple tris in a scene, running on a 3 Ghz machine, but for the average pc running a full game level. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Don't blur the image manually; render a smaller texture. Maybe additionally use, say, three dimmer quads about the origin of the one you're currently using.<br><br>The method you cite shouldn't flicker - quad too close to the camera?<br><br>EDIT: When you say "blur" do you mean "mix frames"? I'd probably be sending the last - rather than current - frame to the quad and that would be that. Extra frames would equal extra quads...

Rendering a smaller texture will make it flicker more. The flickering is caused by the lack of antialiasing, so the Mini-Render is never fully accurate, even when blured. Contours of Objects will jump, and so will the blured "smooth" areas.<br><br>I was also thinking about to use more dimmer quads, but since I would need to alpha them, this means also the Renderer has to go trough a number of Alpha Objects, and that IS slow, especially when they cover the entire screen.<br><br>Ok, now I had this idea:<br><br>1) Render the scene as usual, without the gloom quad.<br>2) use some tricks  to create a mini Render without actually to render the scene.<br>3) use this minirender as a texture on a quad.<br>4) render the quad far away from the scene with an extra camera, but (and that's the point) without to erase the background first. I'm not sure right now if blendmode 3 will also add to 2D backround pixels, I will check this out. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You need variable size, because the window will be less than whatever your window size is when you are at the edge of the image.  <br><br>Doing this requires only one add, subtract, and divide per pixel, and two passes, one for each direction, for a box blur.  <br><br>For a gaussian blur, you need three passses in each direction.<br><br>However, blurring in software is going to be slow no matter what.  You really should do it in hardware.  And for that, I have a function in the code archives which does a hardware blur.  Just click my username and then code archive entries to find it.  It's not perfect, but it might be adequate for this.<br><br>Knowing now though how to do a box blur and a gaussian blur with that window method, I wonder if I could have made a proper hardware blur.

You would have to choose window sizes which are powers of 2 though.  So you could do a 2 pixel box/cubic/gaussian, or a 4 or an 8...  But not a 5 or 6.  The greater the window size however, the more color accuracy you will lose.  I am not sure if this would affect the quality of the resulting blur or not. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There are no delta timing issues since I have no tween frames, the gloom texture is taken every frame. I have tested the method I described and it really works, althouh all in all about 4% slower than the current method.<br><br>sswift - not exactly sure if you are talking about the blitz window size - there's no way for me to use a square window size since the game is running in fullscreen and usually in a 4:3 ratio. I tried to find a blur function in your code archive entries, unfort. without success. EDIT: just found it, bluring a texture. I will have to try if this is faster. It could easily be faster, even with the overhead (or what's looking like it) because my current blur function takes 7ms for one pass on my machine (additional passes only take about 1ms since readpixel and writepixel is done only once, no matter how many passes).<br><br>Ok, here are the two methods that are head on head right now, concerning speed. If anybody can optimize the speed in a relevant amount, do it!<br><br>The first method works like this:<br>It's taking a small render with the Gloom Quad hidden, 128*96 Pixels. This is then blured and then copied to the texture that is used by the gloom quad. Then the Gloom Quad is unhidden and a full resolution game render is performed. Blendmode 3 of the gloom quad that is sticked to the camera, in front of everything else will now produce the gloom Effect.<br><br>In a Scene with 500 cubes onscreen I get about 9ms per frame with no gloom and about 24ms with the gloom turned on (hit space to toggle).<br><pre class=code>

</pre><br><br>Now method 2 that I described eariler actually works like this:<br>Render the Scene in full game resolution, as usual. Then save a copy of the backbuffer in an imagebuffer. Then use a special trick to quickly scale the backbuffer to 128*96 Pixels. This trick is using Copyrect. It's fast, but not very accurate. However, after bluring the result is about the same as the method with the small extra render. Ok, then blur this 128*96 pixels on the backbuffer, then move them to a texture that is used by the gloom quad. Then restore the backbuffer that was saved in an imagebuffer before. Now hide the main game camera and unhide a special gloom camera that is located far away from any geometry of the scene. The gloom quad is also located there, adjusted to the gloom camera. The gloom camera is using a clsmode that won't clear the background. So we still have the last full render as background. The gloom cam will now render only one quad, with the old the background. <br><br>This method is slighty slower than the first one, but it has some potential, because one of the two renders has a very easy job (onyl one quad). At the other hand both renders are fullscreen renders, compared to the first method that is using a 128*96 pixels render for the second one.<br>My machine takes about 9ms without gloom and 25ms with gloom, as you can see, this is only one millisecond more than the other method.<br><pre class=code>

With Mipmapping I'd get a much more smoothly scaled image, but it seems I can't get both.<br><br>Probably I will use a 256 texel texture, 4 or more blur passes and then simply tell the player to turn off the HDR FX if he feels like the framerate is too low. well I'm not happy with this. Then again, my Graphicscard is worse than what's listed in the category "beginner machine" of some game test magazines. Probably I shouldn't care so much about low end playability. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I have been throwing some ideas around for this and how to effect a fast scale seems destined to be a barrier.

No problem. It looks so silly when a thread is full of my postings only.<br><br>I tried that method too. The backbuffer is copied to a texturebuffer that is used by a sprite, then the sprite is scaled as required. It works, and it's pretty fast. But since the texturebuffer needs to use flag 256, the texture isn't mipmapped, and the result is once again the flickering interferences I mentioned due to non-smooth scaling.<br><br>At the other hand the socalled "method 1" (taking an additional mini render of the scene) will probably give some very decent, non-flickering results, depending on the users rendering settings. If he has turned on antialiasing and HiQuality, the minirender should be pretty good. Unfortunately this also means you don' know how't it's gonna look exactly. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This is a lighting procedure designed to emulate the way that light levels in the real world vary over an enormous range. This is mostly achieved by the use of floating point textures and render targets (as well as using the appropriate lighting algorithm); integer formats do not offer the anywhere near the same range of values. Although visually better, the use of floating point formats can result in a large performance impact on some graphics adapters. <br><br><br>BLOOM (GLOW)<br><br>A bloom is a lenticular halo. Blooms are another type of effect seen around lights. While coronas form the fuzzy glow you see around a light at night, or the rays which seem to shoot out from the light of the sun, blooms are a color-banded halo which is usually visible surrounding the corona. They are only seen when a person's pupils are dilated enough. <br><br>(And lens flares are a natural phenomena that occurs when light is refracted many times by some sort of lens, creating several images of geometric shapes to appear from a single light source. Given that fact, you'll find that lens flares are often over used and appear where they ought not to in 3D graphics. In other words, you need a compund lens system for a lens flare. They aren't seen purely with the naked eye.) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The upcoming Heavenly Sword title for PS3 features a new colour-space created with a conversion step at the end of the pixel shaders, that offers improved quality (less banding and other artefacts in most situations according to the devs) at half the bandwidth consumption of FP16. Traditional FP solutions provide a rather false representation of HDR, as they provide high range for RGB components, whereas HDR specifically relates to a wider range of intensities, and not hues.<br><br>I wouldn't be surprised if alternative INT HDR methods become more commonplace seeing as they trade a little shader power for considerable bandwidth gains.
