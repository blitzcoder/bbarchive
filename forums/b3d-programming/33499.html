I want to allow the ability to subdivide the curve.  So if a subidivision of 1 is specified, the curve will have just 4 segments, but if a subdivision level of 2 is specified, each will be divided in half.<br><br>My problem is that if I divide each segment in half I then don't know how much to angle each segment relative to the last, and how long to make each segment to maintain the shape of the spiral, but make it smoother.<br><br>I can't just cut the angle in half.  I've already considered that, and it would not maintain the shape of the curve.  It seems I have to cut it in quarters when I cut the number of segments in half... So maybe I need to divide angle by subdivisions^2.  I'm not sure.  And I still don't know what to do about the length of each segment and the percentage of change.<br><br>Anyone got any ideas?<br><br>Btw, here's some info form mathworld on logarithmic spirals.  Maybe someoen who understand the math better than I can make some sense of it in this context.<br><br><a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LogarithmicSpiral.html" target="_blank">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LogarithmicSpiral.html</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Study the triangles.<br>Each succeeding triangle is exactly like the its predecessor, but with all sides scaled by the same amount.<br><br>It is also rotated, in this case by 22.5 degrees.
