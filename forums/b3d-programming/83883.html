It's textured using a grass texture.<br><br>I want to add the line markings to this, and I'm not entirely sure of the best way to go about it. This is my first time really fiddling about with 3D so it's all new to me. <br><br>I'd rather not just have the mesh created and textured, because different pitches can be different sizes and I'd like to cater for that rather than having every pitch be a uniform size. So the problem is - given a textured rectangular surface, how would I go about adding touchlines etc. to this?<br><br>Thanks <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
