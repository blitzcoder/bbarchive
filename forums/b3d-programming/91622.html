Having said that, I've noticed a slight decline in the frequency of posts on the B3D forums, but that may be related to the time of year and stuff too. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

A Screen Designer and Art Director are required to get a modern overall style. But you probably won't have the latest FX, including state of the art shadows and other fotorealism approaches as seen in todays AAA titles.<br><br>If this is what you want then you may have to use a new engine that will be much more complex than Blitz3D to deal with, will require a team of specialists to get something that could be compared distantly to todays top games (I am only talking about quality, not quantity). And the costs for an engine that is state of the art are often immense. Some of them take millions only for license fees. So if LE really is that good as people say then it's a bargain. I yet want to see a released game based on LE, or on any other of the existing Enhancements to Blitz3D, such as XORs etc.<br><br>Once upon a 12 year old kid could write a game on his Spectrum on sunday afternoon and sell hundred thousands of copies of it. Today the quality of tha AAA games, our work is often compared to, is so extremly high that a single person had to work for 200 Years on it. The production costs of some Games reached the budget of an average Hollywood production, this is a fact.<br><br>Making a game is about as hard as to build a submarine or a spacestation ,and actually one that works :) Of course there are always niches for little games people like joe average can do in his spare time. And they may even look nice, have decent graphics and a modern style. But the better the 3D graphics are, the longer it's gonna take to design level for level. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It was the Mutz Nutz back than - and very powerful. But recently i'm reading a mixed bag of reviews here and at other places. It was only earlier this year that i decided to open up the box and start to see what can be done - but it does seem a bit dated with just DX7 support - compared to another programming language that supports DX9.<br><br>Why has development on Blitz3D been abandoned? And whats so special about BlitzMax? Installing FastLibs or Xor3D - would this bring DX9 functionality to Blitz3D? More importantly - would it make it comparable to DBasic Pro - or woudl one simply have to abandon B3D and purchase that system instead?<br><br>Looking at some of the samples here (and other places)-especially puki's screenshots above (totally brilliant puki - well done) - I think that I have a lot of catching up to do...but can't get my head round the .b3d format (am disecting Rob Cummings FPS test program to get back into the swing of things...so any help or pointing in the right direction would be appreciated).<br><br>At this point in time - am I making a good choice in continuing with B3D (i was even thinking of purchasing FastLibs or Xor3D), or should i concentrate on other avenues?<br><br>And like @Krischan has mentioned - with work (and other) commitments, it makes it very difficult to spend full time on these products, so single scenes and tech demos are the best that us working class can do...lol :)<br><br>I take it that all these software libraries, lieke FastLibs-Xor3D-LeadWerksEngine etc- haven't yet succeded in implemeting a fully fledged product - apart from tech demos or simple scene tests.<br><br>Your advice and help would be most appreciated.<br><br>Regards<br>James <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

And whats so special about BlitzMax? <br></div><br>Blitz3D is a complete product. Development ended when the product reached its specification. BRL have since moved on to other, completely new products, including BlitzMax and the new BMX2. BlitzMax isn't tied to a single graphics engine (it's first and foremost a language; engine is a separate issue) and can use any standard system, but you have to supply it yourself (much like C, Java et al.).<br><br><div class="quote"> Installing FastLibs or Xor3D - would this bring DX9 functionality to Blitz3D? <br></div><br>FastExtension gives you "full" DX7 functionality (more advanced features that weren't reliable at the time Blitz3D came out) and is essentially more of the same thing. Xors3D gives you DX9 by completely replacing the entire Blitz3D engine (i.e. "fixing" it by getting rid of it altogether). SoftPixel is another (free) option that supports DX9 and OpenGL. FastExtension is different from the others in that it builds onto the existing engine rather than completely replacing it.<br><br><div class="quote"> I take it that all these software libraries, lieke FastLibs-Xor3D-LeadWerksEngine etc- haven't yet succeded in implemeting a fully fledged product - apart from tech demos or simple scene tests. <br></div><br>Totally incorrect. Leadwerks especially is a top-end solution and far more advanced and complete than Blitz3D. It's also correspondingly more expensive.<br><br>Essentially... Blitz3D is a product, that does a specific thing (make programs that use DX7). I suggest you approach the problem in terms of what you want to achieve, and how you want to solve it, and assess Blitz3D in terms of how far it addresses said problem, alongside other solutions (i.e. find the best solution to your problem, not find the best problems for your solution).<br><br>My only personal recommendation from the above is that you get FastExtension if you're going to continue using Blitz3D. It's dirt cheap (£8 or so), and as Puki shows above, can make a huge difference without needing to change very much at all. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
