Unfortunately some people are thinking of abandoning BlitzODE which is a huge shame considering the effort you've put into the wrapper.<br><br>The main concerns are with the freezing bug which I understand has been fixed but not yet released, the workload you have undertaken by releasing several different incomplete wrappers within a short period of time and the release of any modified ODE source code which is necessary under the ODE license.<br><br>It is important to stress that according to the ODE license, any modified ODE source code must be supplied with the wrapper/final product.<br><br>While I understand that working on these wrappers is a huge task and you probably don't have much time on your hands, it would be greatly appreciated if you could spare the time to address these issues either here or at the Player Factory forums.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>...and Mods it takes an eternity for the BlitzODE thread to load now (170+ posts with code and images), isn't it about time for a new one? Some of us are still stuck with 56K connections ya know ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It certainly isn't intended as a moan at Arkon.<br><br><div class="quote"> <br>People abandoned ODE when Vorderman developed it, too, mainly because they couldn't be bothered to put the work in to make it work - for example, how many people attempted to fix the rear wheels turning problem and posted up solutions?<br> <br></div><br>I've been around here a while too, unfortunately I don't remember Vorderman's wrapper. However, I feel I've put at least some effort into keeping the current BlitzODE wrapper alive by providing a simple car demo which people can use as a guide for their own projects. The demo also provides a solution to the rear wheel steering, which is a problem that can occur with this wrapper too. These are things we as a community can help each other to fix. But some of the problems with the current wrapper cannot be fixed externally in this way afaik, for example the notorious freezing bug which will kill any functionality BlitzODE has and prevent anyone from using it.<br><br><div class="quote"> <br>that's if you modify the actual ODE dll though, nothing to do with wrappers or game code.. I'm not quite sure what you're telling the poor guy in this one, since he hasn't altered the ODE code itself he's just written a wrapper.<br> <br></div><br>We don't know if the source has been modified because Arkon hasn't responded when asked about it. Besides I'm not sure that ODE comes in a pre-compiled dll form, otherwise it would be just a case of making a userlib declaration for each function, which I'm pretty sure is not the case. If it is modified and the source is not provided then again BlitzODE cannot be used as this is not allowed under the ODE license.<br><br>Arkon must be very busy and that is perfectly understandable, but seemingly totally ignoring the questions and requests from users of the wrappers he produces will only serve to discourage people from using them, in particular his future wrappers. This is ultimately why this thread is here, to bring these feelings to his attention and prevent this from happening.<br><br><div class="quote"> <br>It's still a WIP and he's still working on it..<br> <br></div><br>You see that's the problem, how do you know he's still working on it?

What a polite chap he must be.<br><br>VIP3R : I'd love to see the ODE system brought up to date and completed, and Arkon has done some great work on it, but jumping around bitching about it is not helpful, nor is that list of things that Arkon is apparently not doing (or not doing fast enough for you).<br><br>Personally if you had posted that lot up after I made the first ODE wrapper I would have been more than a little annoyed, especially after putting in all the initial effort and releasing it for you to use.<br><br>I'm sure you didn't mean it but your initial post has slightly the wrong tone to it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
