(ever seen Evil dead?) then adding the psychological "Lovecraft style" (also used by many writers, such as Stephen King) aspect and modernising the whole thing... then at the start put "inspired by the writing of HP Lovecraft"... then probably put "HP Lovecraft" under "special thanks to:"...

Some may argue otherwise, but that's the stand we've held for numerous years and will continue to do so."<br><br>If you are doing a directly derivite work, based on one story in particular or using the names of characters or creatures Lovecraft created it would probably be best to do the ethical thing and include his estate in the deal somehow.  It's certainly cool to be respectful of the man who created the works.<br><br>I'm not aware of any "Prisoner of Ice" story by Lovecraft and I don't recall if the game ever used "Cthulhu" or any other official mythos creations.  You can go that route pretty much without fear of litigation.  In fact the Call of Cthulhu game (I've heard) is legally consiering itself a derivitive of the role-playing game and not the originating author's works.  Kind of weak, but that's business.<br><br>Last I heard the Lovecraft legal estate can be contacted here:<br><br>Robert C.

To hear his melodic yet utterly alien song is to go insane.<br><br>See? It's easy. Lovecraft's style and story content is pretty easy to mimic because it's so well known. Just don't rip off any specific elements from Lovecraft's stories. Don't mention Arkham, don't use any characters from the books, don't have people turning slowly into fish creatures, don't even use the Necronomicon (invent your own evil-sounding book, if necessary), etc. Use your imagination a little and you'll do just fine.

HP Lovecraft wrote a small story entitled "Necronomicon" (or something) it was more of an informational peice about the outline of the book... <br> <br></div><br>KAL, this is utter drivel! If you want to know more about Lovecraft's life, I highly recommend trying to grab a copy of "HP Lovecraft: A Life" by ST Joshi, for starters.<br><br>Lovecraft's father had nothing to do with occultism. He was put into a mental asylum after contracting syphilis and going pretty much insane, and he stayed there until he died. Other than that, very little is known about him at all, other than that he may have been a travelling salesman at one point.<br><br>The Necronomicon is not a real book -- it's purely a Lovecraft invention. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Oh... and look up translations of the necronomicon on the net... I beleive group hysteria must of confused people because I've read a half translated version :| they must really love Lovecraft....<br><br>Rock zimbabwe: was he the guy Lovecrafte wrote "Winged death" with? I liked that story... The thing with Lvecraft is that he wrote MANY short stories (like Stephen King) and it is pretty hard to hunt them all down so I haven't read them all... Actually I think I had a link to a Lovecraft library... something about dark something... erm... I dunno... but as soon as I catch up on my homework I shall continue reading mor Lovecraft and might re-read some books (because they're great)<br><br>Blackjumper: I shall check it out ASAP, sounds interesting <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
