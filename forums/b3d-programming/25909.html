For what it is worth, here's mine!<br><br>After the launch of Blitz 2D, Blitz 3D was higly anticipated for over a year and a half.  It arrived only slightly late as I recall because Mark is a stickler for stability and quality of product.  <br><br>Mark continues to support the 2D product even now.  He has since then, also launched the 3D product and BlitzPlus, not to mention Maplet.  Four products all being supported and he is now developing the fifth, BlitzMax.  <br><br>(I'd like a show of hands please, how many of you have developed or launched 5 commercial products in 3 years, maintained a one to one on-line support service, delivered stable updates for each product and continued to develop new products at the same time)?<br><br>Hmm not many!<br><br>Other than you GFK! (lol)<br><br>Here is my point...<br><br>Mark is a highly focussed, busy chap who needs support and constructive crticism, not negativity.<br><br>CONSTRUCTIVE - so he can build on what is a strong product base.<br><br>I would like to ask the community to think about the long term aspects of Blitz and the associated products, not the instant/quick gratification.<br><br>Think about this.. <br><br>Mark is the reason we are all here on the forum right now, that's a good thing - right?  <br><br>Mark is NOT a God, he's a man, a very talented one at that.<br><br>So, what about the recent update issue?  Length of time between updates?  I think when only two products needed supoort we had it good, now there's still only Mark but there are more products, it is unreasonable for us to expect more in the same period of time. <br><br>We were promised cubemapping - and it is in there isn't it? That's what almost everyone wanted once they'd seen 'Robs' demo - well now we have it!  As promised - delivered.<br><br>The other stuff in the update is additional and useful.  What else did everyone expect?<br> <br>*****<br><br>Talking about Blitz as a dead product does not constructively advance Blitz, it simply distracts people from the truth, especially those who are new to Blitz and new to the forums.<br><br>Blitz is far from 'dead' or 'dying' in fact it's having a great life - you don't have to look far to see it, but when everyone's pointing at the floor and looking down instead of straightforward they're bound to miss it.<br><br>Look ahead - that's the only way to SEE where your journey is taking you, and don't miss the sights on the way!  That way you'll have a better perspective on what is before you!<br><br>Enjoy your journey - don't squander it.<br><br>Enough - I have had my say.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>IPete2. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That's what almost everyone wanted once they'd seen 'Robs' demo - well now we have it!

The same thing happens every time Blitz updates are more than a month apart - you can put money on a spate of "Blitz3D Dead?!" or "No more updates?!" threads appearing more or less overnight.  In fact, the only people who brand Blitz 'dead' are the ones who have never done anything worthwhile with it anyway, so why do they make such a fuss??<br><br>Even if Blitz3D never got another update, its far from dead.  How can it be dead when its so usable?  My copies of Blitz/Blitz3d have paid for themselves hundreds of times over.  Even WITHOUT cubemapping! :)<br><br>If you think Blitz is dead (as of 1.85), reinstall version 1.64 - the first official release, and try using that for a couple of weeks.  You'll be surprised at how much its evolved. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In fact, the folks who wanna mess around and make cool demos are clearly the vast majority of Blitz3D users, so I think it's kind of pointless to tell them to move on. If they were to move on, Blitz3D would not be a commercially viable product.<br><br>If a person who wants to dabble with high end 3D effects isn't able to get a thrill out of Blitz3D and chooses DarkBasic Professional, say, on the basis that it's got more gee whiz features, I don't see how it benefits us.<br><br>I think Blitz3D is a great product, but it still needs to keep up with the Joneses, if only because a serious project I start today probably isn't going to get to market for at least a year, by which time every PC sold in the last 12 months will have DX9 hardware and if I want to stand out from the crowd I'd like to support it.<br><br><div class="quote"> Mark is a highly focussed, busy chap who needs support and constructive crticism, not negativity <br></div><br><br>Mark gave the reasons for the apparent lack of progress in a recent post -- he's been (a) caught up in politics, and (b) he's been largely working on stuff that will benefit all of the Blitz line of products (i.e. BlitzMax, BlitzPlus, and Blitz3D). This seems like a reasonable explanation, but this underlines the fact that an explanation was required... There has been an apparent lack of progress and it did need explaining.<br><br>One obvious explanation for the lack of DX9 support is that BlitzMax is supposedly going to be OpenGL-based. If this is the case, then writing DX9-specific code will delay BlitzMax, which is not in Mark's interest: he's probably not making much money off Blitz3D any more, because he doesn't charge for updates. BlitzMax, on the other hand, will make him a lot of money. This is why I think that he needs to charge for updates; it's probably too late to change the Blitz3D business model though.<br><br><div class="quote"> I saw 3Dmark with DX7 and wow it's still impressive <br></div><br><br>3DMark 2001 uses DX7 features Blitz3D still doesn't support (e.g. bump maps). 3DMark 2001 SE uses first generation pixel and vertex shaders (DX8 stuff).<br><br><div class="quote"> At the end of the day, if your game NEEDS bump mapping, "real" cel shading, vertex shaders or pixel shaders to work, then you don't have a game in the first place. <br></div><br><br>Indeed. If your game needs anything more than an ASCII display then you probably don't have a game. But you may have trouble selling your ASCII game to anyone.<br><br><div class="quote"> Absolutely, I am nowhere near able to use things like bump-mapping, dot3 (wot?) or many of these nice functions <br></div><br><br>You would be if Blitz supported them, because they should be no harder to support than any of the usual features of Blitz3D. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
