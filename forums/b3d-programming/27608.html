PS2 has some good all-in-one-hit features like the anti-aliasing which on modern gfx cards are getting easier to do, however unlike PS2 architecture you never know what spec the target PC will be, hence why you often go for a min spec and recommended spec of PC for your game.<br><br>So errm in reality yes it is entirely possible with a good artist and some clever programming. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Most PC users want/need graphics at higher resolutions, 1024x768 and above, making the graphics card have to work at least 4 times harder.<br><br>BLUE - maybe you should post some screens of PS2 games you like the graphics in. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

"<br><br><br>I would say the answer is not on a pc screen.  I think a lot of the fantastic look of PS2 GC and XBox is due to the fact that the CRT is a lot less able to resolve a pixel, so you get chroma shifts, luma gains, proper black and interlace artifacts.  The screen has a lot to do with it.<br><br>These all help to soften the image on the eye and make the colour seem far better than anything on a normal PC screen.<br><br>The rendering of B3d is also slightly less powerful and not as clean I would say.  But I am being quite picky here.<br><br>For example if I get a texture of a road and look at the dotted white line down the centre in Blitz it would be seen to blur as it goes into the distance.  The same texture in a different renderer (such as OpenGL) looks far better and a cleaner overall.<br><br>Blitz is very good but I would also add that it depends upon who programmes the game, who designs it and who creates the graphics for it.  Get a really good team, like the guys I work with, and you hav a pretty good chance of getting very near.<br><br>These are my experiences, not my guesses.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>IPete2. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
