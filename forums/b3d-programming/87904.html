¬¬¬¬</pre><br><br>A 'Surface' is a collection of some or all of these triangles. By splitting the mesh into differing surfaces, separate areas can be given separate textures and therefore the mesh as a whole can have a much better quality texture since the resolution of pixels of the texture wont have to be 'stretched out' over the entire 'surface area' of the whole meshs' triangles.<br><br>To apply a texture, the a surface can be considered 'unfolded' from the geometry of the mesh, so all the triangles of the surface lie on a plane. Althouugh this may leave 'gaps' in the plan view, these are simply ignoerd. Also, the surface triangles are arranged to fit within a square.<br><br>The texture, a square, 2D image, can then be mapped directly onto the surface. Any areas of the texture image that correspond to the 'gaps' in the surface as mentioned above, will simply not be drawn.<br><br>When the texture is applied, and viewed on the mesh, the surface that was textured displays the texture wrapped around the mesh geometry as intended.<br><br>Texture coordinates differ from standard image coordinates in two ways:<br><br>-- Image coordinates are generally referred to as X and Y for the horizontal and Vertical. Texture Coordinates are named U and V denoting horizonal and vertical but to distinguish from the 2D field. U and V refer to a 3D property.<br><br>-- Image coordinates reflect the actual size of the image, whilst texture coordinates are ratios. U and V only go from 0 to 1<br><br>--Texture Coordinates can be attributed a 3rd coordinate value, W (or Z) which relates to the position of a texel* when applied in 3D space. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There is a hardware limit on that number, which I forget- but it's pretty big.<br>A surface may have multi-textures- the limit of which is determined by the hardware. Software can fake this, but it will slow things down.<br>Any vertice is give an xyz placement, and uv(w) value. <br><br>All concepts of mapping, unfolding and such are, in a rough sense- interpretations of data. Higher res textures mean higher res models- unless you map the display area badly, and 'stretch' a 'big' tri to a 'small' uv texture area. Also, some cards don't like textures bigger than the selected display size.<br><br>tri areas automatically determine orientation based on uv position, thereby rotating or 'flipping' as needed.<br>UV do go from 0 to 1, but negatives and oversized can be used to do wrapping/tiling.<br><br>I think the texel thing is an application-specific use when using the a-buffer(?) or whatever. I think 'normally it is ignored, and commonly 'may' pick a texture or surface. I'm not sure, but I don't think there's a standard.<br><br>The major issue with slowdown usually is more a matter of surfaces than polycount. This is fun to get around, because using alpha complicates z-ordering things so that grouping surfaces can get messy. You know what? ignore this bit. Just use alpha sparingly or cleverly, or expect some tweakiness.<br><br>I'm sure this won't answer all your q's, but maybe it'll help. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
