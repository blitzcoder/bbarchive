THe reason why I want to do this is: I already had DX9 installed, but a few days ago I installed a DVD Drive (SAMSUNG Writemaster), when I installed its software package (Pinnacle DVD Suite), it told me it has to install DirectX 9.0b in order to work. Although I found it stupid since I already had DX9 installed, I agreed. Well since then my machine is totally instable. It crashes randomly. I already deinstalled the whole Pinnacle tragedy. But I still get random crashes. When I play Bitz3D-made Games, they crash sometimes, seems like it has something to do with PlaySound. I have to say that the tested Game never crashed this way before. The Game just exits and DirectX is then paralyzed until I reboot the machine.<br><br>So I'm afraid my current DirectX is messed up. Is there a way to deinstall DirectX, so I can then install the Version that is known to work well? (On Win98) This is my Development Machine. It really sucks.<br><br>BTW: I reccomend not to buy/install the mentioned components! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I work with WinXP a lot BTW. and I really don't like it. <br><br>Anyway, back onto topic.

Hell! I want it on a machine that was isolated from the sick web for good reason. Additionally I've seen a lot of people asking for a downgrade from 9.0c to 9.0b - so it seems it isn't any better.<br><br>BTW: After crashing the Blitz App, the Task Manager tells me that there is something named Winmgmt ("A core component of client management. This process starts when the first client application connects, or when management applications request its services." hu?). I'm afraid I gonna have to use a system point restore that will kick me right back to the previous millenium :/ <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It may be a heat problem, or maybe the power supply is partially dead (or the cpu heat sensor that triggers the fan ).

I just thought it must be the DX thing because it crashed when DX Apps where running, like games. Now I think it is a heat problem. Games also force high performence and therefor produce more heat (never idle cpu). I hope it's pure coincedence that it happened right now when I installed DX9.0b and that pinnacle suite. I checked the CPU fan, it's definitely dead and so the extreme BSODs may have been caused by overheating. Good to see the cpu is still alive.<br><br>Now I got to buy a new fan, they cost almost 10% of a new PC :/<br><br>Anyway, I hope this will fix it, tho I ask myself what caused the fan to "melt down", as parts of the motors are kind of backed. And then I still got to restore that DDHELP.EXE somehow. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There was that permanent sucker in the task list: "dxdllreg.exe". this thing caused tons of troubles, like I couldn't restart the system without to hang, even msconfig refused to close correctly etc. So I unchecked this beast in a final effort in the autorun settings using msconfig.exe.<br><br>Then I used to reboot and then started the DX Uninstaller i mentioned before again. I had to reboot, then I took goodol DX7 :), from the goodol Deus Ex 1 CD, installed. THen I used to run DXDIAG. THe first time it used to hang, so I had to kill it using the task manager. The 2nd time it worked perfectly, all tests successful. I have already played the game that crashed before, no more problems so far. Ok, you never know, but currently it looks like I have successfully downgraded from 9.0b to 7. Upgrading from 7 to 9.0a will be easy.<br><br>And yes, I insalled a new CPU fan. 42.5 swiss francs, ouch! that's about 38US$. I still got the feeling the local dealer fooled me :/ but what could I do? Anyway, 40$ isn't the world.<br><br>Thanks for your help. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
