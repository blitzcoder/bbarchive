Saving The State<br><br>So what are the different approaches we can take to implement a replay system? Imagine a crash of two cars occurring in the street--and that we want to reproduce the scene, making a movie out of it. The first solution is to ask two stuntmen in two new cars to drive the same way, and to turn, accelerate and brake the way original drivers did. If a given number of conditions are met--having almost identical cars, the same traffic conditions alongside the two vehicles, and so on--we can expect that the replay crash will look almost like the original one. The second solution would be to log the important details every few seconds: the position of each car, the position and orientation of all wheels, the state of the body of the car, and the state of any damage--then use this information to reproduce the scene again every few seconds. I suppose you get the point that the second approach is not well-suited for this purpose and would need to store a lot of information about the state of the car at frequent intervals to reproduce the scene accurately.<br> <br></div> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

For that to be true there would have to be functions in the game code that may react in more than one way to the same set of data, whatever that may be.

You simply 'fake' player input at the same frame he pressed last time. (I.e frame0-A-Key In. Frame25-A-Key-Out.) so as far as the game's engine is concerned, there is ZERO difference, as if a key read was missed in a frame, then it would also be missed in the original frame, as they just borrow the same control states.

And there is no problem with things getting out of sync.<br><br>With frame tweening, the physics might be run 10 times a second.  That's 10 keystrokes per second, easily recorded.<br><br>The graphics are tweened so they can run at 60fps if they want to.  That has no effect on this.<br><br>But by doing the physics 10 times a second, and only 10 times a second, you ensure that all objects move the same amount of distance on every comouter, and that they collide with the same objects on every computer.<br><br>And your main game code handles all the explosions, sparks, cars flipping over, etc, just based on these keypresses.<br><br>As all motions always move the same amount every frame on evey PC, there is no way for the calculations to be different from one PC to another, unless you mess up the code and reference the millisecond timer somewhere in your code to time how long something should take... which you should not do with frame tweening. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I - don't - use - a - fixed - update - speed. Just like you I don't like much frame tweening.<br>And this leads to at least recording a full game state every N seconds  (so *in this situation* you do have to setup a separate pipeline anyway, and recording/replaying keystrokes instead of doing a brute force recording is done due to space constraints only).<br>You say <div class="quote"> As much as I hate frame tweening... I never use it myself... using tweening is beneficial to recording demos. <br></div>But if you don't use frame tweening when the user is playing, then using it at replay is not beneficial. <br>Fact: *I* don't use frame tweening -&gt; no fixed game update speed. And I surely won't use frame tweening just for the sake of making replay easier. <br>Consequence : my replay speed is different from the one when recording -&gt; it *does* have accumulating errors and a regular resync (between keystroke replays) is needed.<br><br>BTW, I've searched for the article Otacon mentioned. I've only read some lines, but enough to see that even though he works on a PS2 where having a fixed update frequency is a lot more natural, he does have a regular resync (with a full game state). <br>In short he simply does exactly what I said I would do if space was an issue (and this is more an issue on PS2. On a PC it depends a lot on the context, even though the effort to provide is pretty low if planned from the beginning - as stated by Otacon). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
