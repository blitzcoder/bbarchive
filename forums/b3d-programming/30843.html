I see that you have implemented PostNuke. Click on the PPF2k4 Banner in the top post to go to the PPF2k4 HomePage.<br><br>I have been working on Bot AI and Animation. This is relatively new areas for me, but, im really enjoying it and learning a great deal. I would like to discuss my implementation for more feedback.<br><br>I'm using Finite State Machine AI which is divided into primary 3 functions: botSensor, botReaction, and botMotor. The botSensor is where conditional checks are performed to set the bots state. The botReaction selects a 'Action' and Animation dependent on the state. The botMotor performs movement of the bot.<br><br>At the moment, the AI States are geared around the RedBron animations, however, they can be easily expanded. Heres a list of the animations: run, still, runfire, stillfire, takehit, die1, die2, idle. The botSensor is a list of conditional checks arranged in lowest to highest priority order. <br><br>Currently Seek&amp;Destroy is the only Behavior simulated. However, I would to like add other Behaviors (ie Hit&amp;Run, Sniper, grouping, etc). I will be adding checks to the botSensor to determine health and ammo, so that bots will seek health and ammo when depleted.<br><br>Pathfinding is major portion of the AI. Bots must navigate from any point to another 'legally' and intelligently. I'm currently using a recorded track of Waypoints. There is no processing require with this technique and its really fast. Bots can transverse the level very easy. Bots can handle deadends with no problem. I really have to do some tweaking in this department to make the pathfinding more intelligent.<br><br>Other stuff<br><br>I've taken the liberty to write down some code structs for other objects:<br>Switch (multipurpose trigger for actions and events)<br>Ladder (verticle climb) <br>Door (sliding, swivel) <br>Platform (vertical/horizontal moving lifts) <br>Prop (ie oil-drums, fans, etc) <br>Spawner (bots, ammo, power ups) <br>Teleporter<br>Soundfield (sound) <br>Light (flare, halos etc) <br><br>I have not generated any code but can at a moments notice using Typewriter code generator. Considering bots may interact with some of these objects, I'm going to move forward with code. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You are suggesting that Editor and Engine are the same. I was under the impression we were using Pledit to only orientate objects within the level and save them as PLD.<br><br>I don't see a problem with fusing the editor and engine and would prefer to do this for true WYSIWYG. However, the pledit source is not perfectly structured and cleaned up. It will need a major rewrite for modularity. The engine and editor should use the same code modules.<br><br>I must stress MODULARITY. The engine main.bb should be structured as whats described <a href="/codearcs.php?code=505" target="_blank">here</a> to support a Modular design. This is very common and many coders develop their code in this fashion. Other coders could easy create code module and add it to the engine main file as long as they provide a 'Start','Update' and 'Stop' Function of some sort.  <br><br>Hypothetically, if I were to rewrite Pledit I would consolidate the following:<br>1. Use a configurable keymap for controls.<br>2. Replace the generic object with object structures directly. <br>3. Replace 2D Gui with InGame 3D Gui objects.<br>4. Add additional features WaypointRecorder, particle editor, ammo editor, etc.<br><br>However, I want to avoid any of this. All that is required at the moment is using a conversion between object code structure and editor object structure. This is relatively simple. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You quoted in the first thread that your own project was opensource, but it became kinda disguised-in-shame-of-spaghetti-code. I fear that if we do not communicate specifically what our intentions are this will reoccur. <br><br>I truly believe the reason why other coders have not joined the project is due to the lack of defined game objects and who is working them. Which is why I frequently request we develop a To-Do-List of game objects/properties and whos working them. As a modular game engine, I truly believe that more than one code module could be developed at once. Others could take a gander at the To-Do-List, pick an game object to work, and code it. <br><br>I have stated many times that I'm working on BotAI and how I'm implementing it, however, I have no idea what others are coding :(<br><br>Pledit is a great contribution. From my perspective, the only difference between the editor and 'engine' is the gui interface. The engine could use the very same load/save functions and gui for games. This is why I propose that they share the same code modules. As we improve code for one, we improve the code for the other, is this not more effecient?<br><br>Shambler and others expressed that using generic set of data for game objects would be unsuitable. I would agree. However, this can be solved with translators implmented into the levelloader/saver to transfer info between editor object and engine game object code constructs. Shambler provided some code constructs for lift and soundfield game objects earlier in the project:<br><pre class=code>
Type lifttype
Field name$
Field meshindex ; the mesh
Field xs,ys,zs ;starting position
Field xe,ye,ze ;ending position
Field ws,ps,rs ;starting rotation
Field we,pe,re ;ending rotation
Field f# ;0.0-1.0 where inbetween start and end is it?
Field speed# ;speed of motion
Field dir ;1=forward -1=back direction
Field triggertype ;what triggers it to move?
Field moving ;is it moving?
End Type

Type soundtype
Field name$
Field class ;ambient oneshot everytime ?
Field playing ;sound is playing now?
Field pivot ;used for entity distance triggering
Field radius# ;as above
Field soundindex ;which sound does this use?
Field timer ; how long has the sound been playing?
Field time ; when was the sound started?
End Type</pre>All that is needed is liftStart, liftUpdate, liftStop, soundStart, soundUpdate, soundStop functions for engine main. I could easily use the Typewriter to generate a code module for each of these constructs in a few minutes. In fact, the objectStart() could be used by the levelloader to load in the data for that particular game object.<br><br>I have integrated your seek&amp;destroy and waypoint recorder system into a modular system. It was relatively easy to do because I identified the common variables between our two systems and merge them. My point is, I used your code only modifying the labels, save myself lots of work. I'm doing the same for Pledit. <br><br>The major problem with pledit is that the gui is 2D and directly integrated into the editor. Its a very nice gui, however, its not modular. I strongly believe that it will save us major heartache to convert the gui into a modular 3D gui (hud) which could be used in the games as well. The big benefit is that others could add new gui controls.<br><br>I'm not declaring others work as obsolete. On the contrary I'm binding them to work together. Binding different code together is an extremely difficult task for a open source project. This is something that did not occur in the first PPF, thus, it r.i.p. <br><br>In spite of the appearence, there is a significant portion of the engine completed we just have to bind the components together. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Most of jfk's concepts and code have been integrated into my own. What better form of collaboration. Collaboration is the key, and I have made efforts and will continue to do so.<br><br>I must stress that <a href="/codearcs.php?code=505" target="_blank">MODULARITY</a> for this game engine is critical. Build a base of game objects and add on top of them. The 'engine' is binding these game objects to work together. There is no design document, but, we do have a pretty good idea what game objects need to be developed as there are plenty FPS games.<br><br>Currently, there are several game objects not defined. We know that FPS games contain Doors, Ladders, Lifts, Spawners, Keys &amp; Switches, Props, Soundfields, Lights, and HUD(gui). These interactive game objects behave practically identical in every FPS. I cannot find a solid reason why they could not be developed now if their properties were defined. <br><br>This brings me to the concerns with the Pledit editor.  Currently, The Pledit editor uses a generic object management system the game engine does not. Developers can  write code that define Doors, Ladders, Lifts, Spawners, Keys &amp; Switches, Props, Soundfields, and Lights in a variety of ways. The engine loader will have to support this possibility, which is why a separate loader has to be developed.<br><br>The Pledit GUI is directly integrated into the code of the editor. Its a very good one at that, however, if the gui was modular it be used for other tools. A 3D Gui would even serve a greater purpose as it could be used for in-game HUD. The Loader and GUI is only difference between the editor and game engine. <br><br>What if the editor and engine use the same Loader and GUI? A Editor could be built directly into the Game Engine for true WYSIWYG content editing. The editor should be built around the engine not the reverse. A simple text editor could be used as a game editor for that matter.<br><br>Now, with all this said. I'm using Pledit in its current form to slap together a test level and get some bots running around. But, the engine will require a different loader and GUI system. Ultimately, the current form of Pledit will be replaced with an Builtin Editor once thes game components are created. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This is implemented in most of the code modules and new ones will include it. What is Managed ID Referencing? Well, in a nutshell, I use Blitz custom Types to package every 'object' in the engine. An array of types is used to store and reference each object by an id (index) number. A specific MAX number of objects is defined for ids.<br><br>A FILO stack is used to track what objects IDs are in use or not in use. IDs are push and popped of the stack as needed. I found this form of management to provide the best flexibility and control for both dynamic and predetermined events. I will be setting up objects to reference others by id. My work with Databases is a heavy motivator for this implementation. Its also known as "Table Oriented Design."<br><br><img src="http://techlord.blackeve.com/new.jpg">Blitz3D Catagory Code Modules. These are modules that package many of the Blitz2D/3D Catagory Objects (ie: Mesh, Sound, Texture, etc) into its own code module for use by the engine. These 'catagory objects' will contain pratically every Blitz property needed to define Brush, BSP, Camera, Entity, Light, Listener/Audio, MD2, Mesh, Mirror, Pivot, Plane, Sprite, Surface, Terrain, Texture. I have found it much easier to edit catagories only referencing or copying them as needed for other objects. <br><br><img src="http://techlord.blackeve.com/wip.jpg">Improved Bot AI. Using both Recorded Waypoints and Pathfinding Algo for collision avoidance. I'm going to extend seek and destroy algo to seek out specific waypoints. A variety of Game objects/items can be placed at the 'target' waypoint in which bots seek them out. I have not quite worked out the collision bug in my A* so I'm considering a rewrite. Bots will need some form dynamic pathfinding in order the their behavior to seem more realistic.<br><br><img src="http://techlord.blackeve.com/wip.jpg">Improved level Loader. Implementing modular Loader functions in the code modules. Loads game data in ASCII format from CSV and Data files. Managing the level data in CSV is relatively easy. In fact, I'm using Microsoft Excel as level editor to modify the CSV contents.<br><br><img src="http://techlord.blackeve.com/final.jpg"><a href="http://techlord.blackeve.com/typewriter2.zip" target="_blank">Improved Type Writer][ Code Wizard</a>. I use this utility to generate code, saving much time. The improved version generates initialization, update, destruction, csv loader/saver object functions for use with Level Loader, Editor, and Game Saving. All is that remains for the coder is to write is the modifier and interactivity object functions and modify as necessary. The functions produced are are specifically designed to support the <a href="/codearcs.php?code=505" target="_blank">Main.bb framework</a>.

In fact I have implemented switches, gadgets, flares, reactors (particles), warps, soundfields, and modules. They work in very basic manner at moment and will be expanded. However, there are a few that need some time. <br><br>The Ladder object aka Climber. The Ladder object is a 'field' in which the player or bot moves vertically up or down upon collision, dependent on the direction of travel. I'm pondering over the implementation of this game object. My current idea is to simply turn off gravity and jump to the player within the field. The player can move freely up or down, but, once out of the field gravity is turn on. If any one else have implemented Ladders, please sure your thoughts.<br><br>Platforms aka Lifts are moving game objects that transport player and bots. My current platform design will move horizontally, vertically, and patterns using waypoints. Although most cases these are platforms in which players stand on, they dont have to be. Platforms require dynamic collision detection and gravity is applicable. Dynamic Collision is tricky, but, others have managed it and I'm looking for ideas to do the same.<br><br>Now some of you may be wondering what are soundfields, warps, and modules. Soundfields are basically pivot points with blitz sphere or cube collision applied. They emit sound upon collision. The idea behind them is to shape 3D sound emissions. Collision can also be used to trigger AI sensors etc.<br><br>A Warp Object is a cubic field that simulate gravatational forces on players/bots/particles. I have been able to effectively simulate gravity, anti-gravity, wind, and turbulence. You can also use these for vacuum tubes accelerators etc.<br><br>The Module Object is an object that stores a pool of the entities for recycling. Great for creating and managing LOD mesh sets, particle sprites, etc. This object also serves us great in optimizing the overall game engine. For example, if only 5 bots entity can be seen at once at any given time, why load or copy 20 entities? You dont! You simple recycle 5 bots entity when in view. This methodology can be applied to replicated game objects.<br><br>Reduce the number of entities copied and loaded, reduce loadtime, memory consumption. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Communication is very tough in a project with no solid game design plan. I've constantly ask for input what should go into this engine. I've known at the beginning it would be very difficult to write a game engine without a plan. With a few notions of how the FPS should play and what type of engine we wanted to design, I've pieced together a plan:<div class="quote"> 1. Define game play objectives:<br>a. Player should be able transverses Level Map with a FPS Weapon. Player should be able to Walk, Run, Jump, Duck, and Strafe with gravity and collision applied. Player should be able to fire weapons in these positions. Player should be able to climb ladders and ride moving platforms.<br>b. Player should be able to shoot Enemy Bots and destructable props. Player should be able select a variety of weapons each different in appearance. Weapons should vary in ammo. Ammo should vary in shape, flight path, damage effect, and particle effects.<br>c. Player should be able to pick up Powerups and Keys<br>d. Player should be able to unlock doors and trigger switches which activate events and ai.<br>e. Player should have a goal(s) to complete the level and move to next: shoot all bots, find exit, and find item.<br>f. Bots will use finite state machine AI to select an action and pathfinding algos to transverse level. Bots should walk, run, jump with collision applied. Bots should be able to fire weapon in these positions. <br></div>The next step was to define the game engine requirements. This was only step that received any input and it was very brief. "The engine should be modular." This requirement in itself required more detail as many had not written a modular game engine. From my previous experience with other FPS game engines to include: Torque, Quake, Cipher, and others, I was fully aware that game object would have be divided in to small code modules each with a specific purpose. An  object-based designed would support a modular design. There were many other engine requirements not mentioned, thus I had to defined them.<div class="quote"> 2. Game Engine Requirements<br>a. Modular Engine Design<br>b. Resource Management System for Optimized memory consuption and performance<br>c. Optimized Rendering using Portals, Level Of Detail, Mininized Surface Count for trees, particles, and ammo.<br>d. Server Client Multiplayer Support with minimized bandwidth requirements. <br></div>From the game play objectives and game engine requirements, I had to identify interactive and non-interactive game objects to build modular systems needed to acheive these objectives and requirements. I identified many game objects and subobjects, each with their own purpose.<div class="quote"> 3. Define game objects and suboobjects.<br>a. Bots - Intelligent game entities that engage the player in combat.<br>b. Props - Non intelligent game entities that the player can interact with.<br>c. Weapons - A game entity held in the FPS Arm, generates ammo. <br>d. Ammo - Ammo game entity that causes damage upon impact to player, bot, props, and level.<br>e. Particles and Flares - For visual effects<br>f. Platforms - For verticle lift Elevators, hortizontal Moving Tiles<br>g. Warps - for influencing gravity, anti-gravity, wind, vacuums, turbulence on player, bots, and particles. <br></div>I designed these objects to meet the needs of an a FPS game and beyond. <br><br>The bottomline: you cannot just slap an engine together for it to be modular, expandable, and reusable. It needs planning, continuity, and documentation. This requires standards to be in place. Successful development teams implement standards. I have written tools to assist the effort standardizing and minimize code writing. I can only speak through my actions. Its either put up or shut up. As I stated in the <a href="/posts.php?topic=29225" target="_blank">Thread 2</a>," The project's success is completely dependent on the contributions of the community. I just hope the community will contribute (tangible) code and media and not just opinions."<br><br>I truly appreciate all the hard work and efforts from those who have and are making contributions. I hope others will take time to download, view, and understand the current code and media and make a choice to contribute. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Object oriented methodology, while you could just say using blitz types and functions belonging to them in neat modules. A "primary ID key!", so you've numbered/named your types and put em in an array, big deal. Oh and the best one, a dedicated FILO stack, instead of just saying you keep the unused types in memory and use the next available one, which btw. has nothing to do with stacking and most definately nothing at all with order, since there's no difference in objects that are all of the same state (unused). All in all your cool lines and descriptions might sound realy nice to you, but most of the average blitzers will think it's over their heads, while it's realy nothing hard to work on...<br><br>The more advanced users will just have a good laugh and wonder how on earth you'd describe a system that's actualy complex.<br><br>Sorry if this sounds offensive, but try to see it as a piece of advice, you're making a community project as untransparent as you possibly can by using terminology you shouldn't be using for something this trivial. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You call things stuff that's not exactly simple/explicit, and give information that isn't neccessary to give. For example;<br><br>Markerset/Waypoint- I don't know what the differences in your utilization for these terms are.<br><br>FILO Stack- Saying 'First in, Last out' can't kill you.<br>"If one does not understand these terms, they can ask me..." doesn't work as well as not 'complicating' things to begin with. Yes I know the terms are accurate and expressive- but you know someone working on another part of your lib will possibly never need to care- especially if they've been 'scared off' by the 'apparent complexity' of the engine. <br><br>The code itself doesn't look that complex- but I spent way too much time trying to figure out how your 'big picture' explanations coincided with the actual code.<br><br>No one knows (but Mark pretty much) what's inside his routines- they are black boxes that do things, take vals &amp; return vals. Well, not exactly, but you get my point- if you had a routine, then you can keep it simple by saying it sorts an array up or down, 'Sort (Up=TRUE)' or by saying it was a radix sort that took a boolean value to determine ascendancy (or some such) 'RadixSort (Ascend=TRUE)'- bad, exaggerated example, just making a point. One encourages people they will have no problem helping out- the other will likely make some people frown &amp; move on.<br><br>I would suggest that if it was at all possible, to liken your project routines to be blitz command extensions, and name, code &amp; document accordingly. ie- anything that works on terrains (or meshes which represent terrains) can be named like &amp; be 'made compatable with' the blitz terrain commands. I'm not saying use terrains- just work in a manner that is 'terrain familiar' if possible.<br><br>I'd like to see an example of what the 'Typewriter Code wizard' does, as I have only a vague idea- ie- I could tell someone else what it's supposed to do, but I don't know how to use it.<br><br>I could make other suggestions, but I'd really have to understand what you're doing more first- I honestly could be wrong about many things I've pointed out as I haven't sat down &amp; tried to cram it all in. You could assume it's because I'm lazy, an inferior coder, or whatever- and that could be true as well- but if your documentation gets a bit more focused &amp; explains things better, I think you'll find there are more good coders out there.<br><br>Anyway, good luck to you. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It has been very difficult. I will attempt to explain what I'm doing here in the most simple way I can (no promises:)). I will attempt to keep my explanation brief and focused on the engine. So here it goes...<br><br>Currently, there are 4 parts to the engine: Level Data File, Level Loader, Resource Management, and Main.bb. The engine are the objects created working together.<br><br>Level Data File - Is a <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/ASCII.html" target="_blank">ASCII</a> <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/comma_delimited.html" target="_blank">Comma Delimited Format (*.csv)</a> file that stores all the data needed to load and create Resources: Entity (meshes, sounds, images) and game specific objects (bots, platforms, etc). <br><br>Level Loader - Parses the Level Data File *.csv loading/creating resources for use within the engine. The level loader can also parse children mesh labels from *.B3D or *.3DS level map geometry to create resources.<br><br>Resource Management - All resources (entities &amp; game objects) in the engine are designed to be uniquely identified and recycled. Resources are recycled like particles in a typical Particle System. The idea is to load once, use and reuse as needed, and remove upon exiting the engine. This is were things get tricky and the words 'Primary Keys' and 'FILO Stacks' voice themselves. Stacks are used to recycle Resources and IDs (Primary Keys) are used to reference them.<br><br>Main.bb - The engine design is modular. With each game object and subobject that performs a specific purpose contained in its own module (*.bb file).  All the modules are included in the <a href="/codearcs.php?code=505" target="_blank">main.bb</a>. All objects provide a 'Start','Update' and 'Stop' Function to be included in the main. <br><br>The reasons above are why I was able to developed <a href="http://techlord.blackeve.com/help.htm" target="_blank">TypeWriter][</a>(<a href="http://techlord.blackeve.com/typewriter2.zip" target="_blank">download</a>) for Project PLASMA FPS 2004. TypeWriter automatically writes common intialization, deletion, load and save functions for use by the Level Loader, Resource Management and Main.bb. The functions produced are exactly the same for all objects, promoting consistency.<br><br>END<br><br>continue at your own risk...<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-based_programming" target="_blank">Object Based Design</a><br><br>The core of my Object-based design is the Blitz Type.

Its implied by many that because this project is <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/o/open_source.html" target="_blank">Open Source</a> its anything goes. But we cannot go anywhere without a plan from point A to point B. This has been my stance from the very beginning. Due to the lack of input on a game design plan, engine design plan, and standards earlier in the project, I have devised my own game design to move the project forward.<div class="quote"> The level loader could save to binary, csv, or packed factored primes- long as it works I don't care unless I'm coding it. The filetypes supported are important though. <br></div>Yes, its true data could be saved to binary, csv, or packed factored primes, etc:). The <a href="/codearcs.php?code=507" target="_blank">Level Loader</a> could be designed to read these formats as well, however, I chose csv as a 'standard' for its popularity. Any coder who knows this standard, knows exactly how to get the data into the loader.<div class="quote"> Resource management sounds automatic, or easily managable at least. Again, as long as the program doesn't hog all the memory, bog the system, or crash- the architecture it uses internally to accomplish this is functionally irrelevant unless I'm coding it. The nature of this functionality (automatic, integrated into functions?) is again, more important- although if automatic, it is functionally irrelevant except as a (hopefully) transparent feature. <br></div>The Resource Management model is standarized and designed for complete control and speed. The notions of infinite types are eliminated as the maximum number of objects created have to be specified. There are many ways to manage game entities and objects. The model employed here is recognizable and consistant.<div class="quote"> Is the main a skeleton for building? <br></div>The <a href="/codearcs.php?code=505" target="_blank">main.bb</a> is the main executable. It brings all the objects together. It is the 'engine'. A standard has been established for it as well: "All code modules should be stored in a independent *.bb and provide a Function for Initialization, Game Loop Update, and Termination (Memory Removal) to be used in the Main.bb. These are the only functions allowed in the main.bb."<div class="quote"> does it suport timed events/simulated multithreading? <br></div>These features have to be implemented in the object. Each object has its own update function. The main.bb merely cycles through each object's update function in the main game loop. The 'switch' object is designed to manage timed and triggered events within the engine.<div class="quote"> I am assuming 'game objects' are just your abstracted way of saying 'code which uses the engine', though I could be wrong. <br></div> 'Game Objects' are objects with specific interactive properties within the game. Examples: Bots, Switches, Platforms, Props, etc. Each game object behaves differently and have their own code module that contains all the needed functions to manage their interactivity.<div class="quote"> Again, your explanation of the Typewriter left me without any clue as to what is input into it (blitz code?), and what you set/do before it does it's magic. Further, is this optional, or manditory? <br></div>I have developed TypeWriter][ specifically to meet the design standards I've established.<br>It produces object-based functions that are used by the game engine's level loader and resource management system. Please read the <a href="http://techlord.blackeve.com/help.htm" target="_blank">TypeWriter][ Help File</a> or <a href="http://techlord.blackeve.com/typewriter2.zip" target="_blank">download the code</a> for explanation and demos.<div class="quote"> I'm not trying to be a bug- I'm just saying maybe it's time to take a quick break, review the thread, and integrate others questions/concerns into a new draft of your core ideas- along with some expectations for expansion. <br></div>Until recently, there has not been much input on the programming side and the recent input has been in regards to my programming terminology. To be quite honest, I'm too far into the engine to back up or back out. There is now a game design plan, engine design plan, code and media in place. I have put a great deal of time into design process and feel comfortable with my implementation.<div class="quote"> For example; I don't know where your routines are (or should be) for a number a functions, or what expectations you'd have if they needed to be coded. <br></div>I apologize for not pointing out the Link in the top post labeled <a href="http://techlord.blackeve.com/ppf2k4.zip" target="_blank">Project PLASMA 2k4 03/01/04 Frank Taylor</a>. It contains the most recent code and media as I update once a week. Unfortunately, there is no documentation at the moment. <br><br>The source is open and available for expansion and improvement. If you have a improved loader, resource management system, action system, optmized rendering technique, network, etc present them. If you have an idea on game play present them. If you have models, music, sound, and images present them as well.<br><br>The demo showcases the following game objects or features that have been implemented: <br>Level Loader<br>Switches<br>Warps<br>Reactors(Particle Systems)<br>Flares<br>Props<br>Lights<br>MusicTracks<br>Soundfields<br>Gadgets<br><br>The todo list includes:<br>Builtin Editor<br>Platforms<br>Weapons<br>Ammo<br>Bot AI<br>Network<br>Console(optional)<br><br>Ultimately, if one wants to contribute source code, they will have to apply the standards. The standards keep everyone in sync. If the standards need to be improved, then it should be presented and implemented, otherwise, there is no excuse not to use them. Over the past 3 years, I have made several attempts to program a optimized and modular FPS game engine. I have participated in two Open Projects (both failed :( ). These experiences tought me something new. It is this experience that I have brought to this project.<br><br>So, many will not agree with my standards, my coding style, my terminology, my point-of-view. Its to be expected. However, the project's success is completely dependent on the contributions of the community. I just hope the community will contribute (tangible) code and media and not just opinions. I rest easy knowing that in some form or fashion I contribute. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I think charting out a standard &amp; design plan are very strong showings of a good cohesive design- I'm simply suggesting that the way you present the information for that standard makes it seem a bit prohibitive to be a part of (IMO). I saw the link at the top of your thread, and none of the things I pointed out seems to be implicitly part of any of those libs. I didn't search every lib for them, and my point is I shouldn't have to. So- if they are there somewhere, one should be able to tell without digging- if they are not, my point was (&amp; still is) that a pseudocode shell for the function's performance might not be a bad idea.<br><br>Anyway, I get the impression you feel I'm attacking your project, which is not the case- I am just expressing my viewpoint on how some minor changes in documentation may encourage others to join in.<br><br>Again, good luck to you. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
