Just wondering, I have a kids game I started work on in Reality Factory, and when they made changes to the engine they broke the level I had completed and the game no longer worked correctly, player couldn't pick up the weapons etc..  I was thinking about porting this project to Blitz if someone has an example I can look at to learn from, mainly just the major parts, I need examples for doing savegame, cameras, weapons and smooth animation using .x files for the characters, and maybe do the levels using maplet and export to b3d I guess, whatabout doing entities in the level like different power ups and weapons and health and stuff.  I know this is a big, and sounds like a newbie question, but using other languages I have been capable of developing stuff similar to this, and just need some insight into how to do different complex things in Blitz.. So if anyone has a demo or example game with these types of things in it, and don't mind sharing the source for learning purposes not to steal and reuse, but to learn how to do my own engine mainly, please either send me an email at storm3@... or im me on msn messenger or just reply to this topic.<br><br>Thanks again, I really appreciate having a huge user base like this to gain knowledge from as I learn the blitz language.<br><br>Ken <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The code is total crap though, and i haven't thought of a save game or anything.<br><br>It has a sprite module, a pattern-based module (basically choose points and a sprite will move there), player-character module, non-player character module, projectile module, an item system, where you have 3 types of items, action items which do something based on collision, moveable items such as a ball in a ballgame or whatever, and inventory items - which don't really do anything other than mark when they've been picked up, as well as dissappearing from screen.  It also has an animation module, with an animation controller...  I also forgot to mention the platform/tile collision system, works pretty good, you setup tiles, and based on where there's a tile the player will collide with the tile almost correctly.  (I think it probably has a few bugs, but it works), the pc and npc module both use the tile module for tilebased games.<br><br>But like I said, it's almost total crap ;-)  You may not even understand any of it, but if you want to take a look i'll post it somewhere for you to look at it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
