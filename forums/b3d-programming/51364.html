</pre><br><br>Now, I assume this is how you mean to use delta timing.  The problem is, the ship does not slow down at the same rates with different delta times.  If the game runs quickly, the speed value will decrease at a fairly fast rate, and the ship will stop in a short distance.  However, if the game is running slowly, the delta time will cause the ship to move faster for every loop, but its speed will decrease at the same loop rate (slower in world time).  The result is that the ship will stop a much further distance away, and take longer to stop.<br><br>I got to looking at this problem further, and it may be solvable if you subtracted away from the speed, instead of multiplying a &lt;1 value.

You cannot multiply by a delta - only add or subtract.  However as I showed in my example above if you perform the multiplication or division at an interval using a software timer you can effectively use constant fps mathematics and still get all of the advantages of delta timing. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'd set the 0 value to 0.000001 as that's the epsilon value Mark uses in GEOM.H for B3D and if it's good enough for Mark, it's good enough for me. ;) But it makes delta very easy to understand for anyone.<br><br>And thanks John for clearing up the differences of which syntax to use for delta calculations. I've always been a TIMER person, but have been reminding myself I need to switch to delta sometime soon and I think I'll do it now. :)<br><br>+BlackD <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
