You would walk into a very small enclosed area and HL would then load the next area. All Valve did was to create one big level design and break it down into smaller files.<br><br>The areas you walked into which were inbetween, they existed in both files. They did screw this up a bit and had slightly altered lighting between certain areas, but the continuity of space still existed.<br><br>The reason Valve broke the areas into separate sections was primarily to conserve RAM. This was back in the days where 128MB was common. 3D levels with their accompanying texture files still are quite large datasets, so it's something to keep in mind, unless you are aiming your game for the 'I can play Battlefield 2 without stuttering' crowd ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If it's a small indoor world, then there's no need to make it overly complicated and a single model would suffice.<br><br>On the other hand, if your world is a worldscape, then you need to implement tiling, dynamic loading and managing of numbers(centering the camera) etc.<br><br>I generally opt for the latter because it gives you much more freedom, but on the other hand, I have done much research into how to do weird and wonderful stuff, but haven't released much.<br><br>Andy <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
