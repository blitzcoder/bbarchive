Sybixsus's model is 14,000 polys, or 3 1/2 times bigger than this. So each frame would be, I guess, around about 360k. And he said he has 1000 frames, so that's a 360Mb file.

I exported with blended vertex weights to b3d file format but since Blitz doesn't support blended vertex weights there was no good way to actually view the model.<br><br>Also, I discovered when I posted that model that people thought it actually looked alright without blended vertex weights!  That is, while I could clearly see the ugly buckling of polygons at joints, most people (again, apologies for stereotyping coders) weren't even sure what to look for.  For example, I was literally arguing with people about whether or not the buckling of polygons on the character's shoulders mattered.  Mustang hit the nail on the head when he sarcastically commented that it looks fine - if you squint your eyes while looking.<br><br>That model also extrapolates on the traditional cylinders example quite nicely.  The traditional comparison of skeletal animation with and without blended vertex weights is just a simple bend in a cylinder (for those with CharacterFX, this example is even included as one of the sample scenes.)  Without blended vertex weights the bend is sharp and unnatural, but with it the bend is smooth and organic.  Along the same lines, without blended vertex weights the polygons of Adele's stomach bend sharply and/or overlap when he hunches forward to run.<br><br>***<br><br>Getting back to the original question, 14,000 polygons is probably too much.  On newer hardware this might work for a tennis game since there isn't much scenery and only two players on-screen simultaneously, but on older hardware that's just too much.<br><br>EDIT: Oh, I just noticed you intend for this character alone in a cinematic.  Ignore my comment. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Maybe this want key a year ago, because 1200 poly chars do reasonable without weighting... but right now its cutting my animator's productivity with maybe 66%.

The old way of doing things using separate "blocks" (hierarchial animation) just relied on hierarchy and "limbs" themselves (vertices) were not modified runtime, just rotated (like what .3DS format animation is only capable of). <br><br>When you don't have separate limbs at all and the whole charater is made of "seamless chicken wire mesh" then the bones that animated that have to move / deform vertices inside the mesh. First examples used rigid way which cause creases and general ugliness because you don't get smooth vertex deformation but sharp "edge" between two vertices that belong to different bones, and soon weighting appeared that allowed bends to act more naturally.<br><br>Sadly Blitz is still in the dark ages of character animation and can only use non-weighted seamless characters - which is useless basically. You COULD try to overcome the lack of weighting with more bones, but that would require more CPU time when drawing that because there's 2-3 times more complex bone hierarchy for Blitz to solve... also rigging character with excessive amount of bones is PAIN and animating it PAIN^2.<br><br>Few random links roughly about the subject:<br><br><div class="quote"> Introducing multiple weights per vertex improves the smoothness of the mesh-hull. This process is called vertex blending. This is achieved by allowing more than just one bone to influence each vertex, effectively mimicking the way that a bone in the real world would affect the skin of a living being. Each vertex is given information about which of the bones in the skeleton influence it and how great the influence of those bones is (skin weight). What we need is a skin that will blend smoothly between the rigid joints. <br></div><br><br><a href="http://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/studentwork/CESCG/CESCG-2002/MPutzKHufnagl/02_related.html" target="_blank">http://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/studentwork/CESCG/CESCG-2002/MPutzKHufnagl/02_related.html</a><br><br><a href="http://www.geocities.com/rgkovach/wp_tut.htm" target="_blank">http://www.geocities.com/rgkovach/wp_tut.htm</a><br><br><a href="http://www.geocities.com/rgkovach/altwp_tut.htm" target="_blank">http://www.geocities.com/rgkovach/altwp_tut.htm</a><br><br><a href="http://www.okino.com/conv/skinning.htm" target="_blank">http://www.okino.com/conv/skinning.htm</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
