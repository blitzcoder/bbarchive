Oh yeah, nothing.<br><br>I don't plan on using either of the new eye-candy features in any of my projects. No big deal, Blitz was a great language before the updates, and the collision bugfix has fixed what was broken in 1.83 so it's all good.<br><br>I'm afraid I don't know what 3d GameCreator Pro is. I'm not sure if you mean 3d Gamestudio, DarkBasic Pro or something else I'm not familiar with. But if it was truly a better product than Blitz, you would be using it instead. So evidently it has it's problems too.<br><br>I do think this is probably a stop-gap update with enough eye candy and things to play with to keep people busy until Blitz Max comes out. But that's cool, because I think Blitz3d is coming to the end of it's development cycle now anyway. I think the kind of additions you'd like to see added to Blitz3d would cripple it in it's current state, and I think we need BlitzMax for all of that. So the more time Mark has free to spend on BlitzMax, the better, as far as I'm concerned. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

They just render once when the world is created and leave it at that. Remove the function which updates the cube maps from the main loop and your game will run much faster. <br> <br></div><br><br>Yup, updating cubemaps EVERY frame will kill your framerate for sure... do it only once, or update every 10th frame - or better yet, have few pre-rendered cubes saved and load those... like for example for every greatly  different location on your game like dim indoors, shiny becah, sea, etc...<br><br>Also note that you don't have to update EVERY face; for example if your walking on a outdoor terrain, the sky stays basically the same, like the ground below, so you might have to update only the sides... but usually it's best to use only pre-rendered cubes / cubes gerated with code when the game starts. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you want the latest features, grab your C++ compiler and Direct X 9.0 SDK ... then have at it.  Blitz3D is here to create reliable games for indie developers.  Sure you can create cool tech demos with it but it also has to be able to create some stable low-end games.  We're not going to compete with 'AAA' titles on this front in terms of technology so get over it.  There are plenty of lower end games making a lot of money out there and at this moment Blitz3D is very capable of making incredibly competent software for this market.  You love Blitz because the other guys can't keep up with their bugs do to the fact that they are trying to fullfill some crazy feature requests.  Grab your copy of Blitz and push it to it's furtherst boundries in a game related environment and you'll be rewarded!<br><br>Look at BlitzPlus!  Mark took the DX down a notch so it will be compatible with more machines.  That is how you sell software to a broad audience.  Look at RealONE Arcade or Dexterity.  They sell a lot of games and the best sellers have the lowest system specs.  <br><br>If you don't want to make games then do what I said above.  Get C++ and the DX 9.0 SDK.  You'll be able to create all kinds of crazy effects and if you're not worried about creating a whole game it's not really too tough to do.  There are a million books out there that can have you running 3D simulations in MS Visual C++ in no time.<br><br>It's all just opinion in the end however.  I can't tell you what you should be using your copy of Blitz3D for.  In my opinion aim for 5 year old systems with a really good game and you'll be rewarded. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I recommend making sure the mipmap flag isn't set (as any alteration will cause mipmaps to be rebuilt) and/or only refreshing one face per frame or even every N'th frame.<br><br>The reason Blitz has never offered a 'render directly to buffer' option is because it is/was broken on many cards/drivers. This situation may have changed by now, but I wouldn't bet on it. This is one of several cases in Blitz3D's design where I have made a deliberate decision to sacrifice (hypothetical) performance for the sake of compatiblity. Such decisions are my call, and I stand by them! Although I understand how others may disagree...<br><br>Dot3 blending is 'unofficial'. Blitz3D's current design makes it too tricky to implement proper, generalized dot3 bumpmaps (ie: normals in 'surface space') lit by multiple lights, so I was faced with the decision to either remove plain dot3 blending or leave it in for the community to 'unofficially' play with. I left it in.<br><br>Another option would have been to provide some kind of kludge for half-arsed 'one light/object space' dot3 bumpmaps - but I'd rather spend the time working on the real thing.<br><br>I am reluctant to charge for Blitz updates, as I would therefore feel obliged to provide them (!) and this would distract me from what I feel is the 'greater good'.<br><br>I guess the bottom line is that I have my own intuition of where Blitz needs to go, and you guys are just gonna have to trust me!<br><br>Mark <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

When I first experienced these kinds of threads, I felt the same way...<br><br>However, bear in mind that only Mark Sibly knows what is what, and everything else is speculation.<br><br>I think alot of people are speculating too much... However, the speculation is propably due to the lack of information which is much sought after in the community. The problem is that when Mark comments on the future of B3D or Blitz MAX or even the language of Blitz products, then a heated debate begins. One side couldn't care less about compatibility and want B3D to be all DX9 with all of the bells and whistles to make DOOM3 clones, and the other side wants DX7 and stability in order to produce good looking games for the massmarket. Either side is full of egos and in the end Mark is caught in the middle having to make the long term plans, knowing that everybody will be offended because their pet feature didn't make it.<br><br>This is propably why he doesn't post more info and why he said that we just have to trust him.<br><br>Some people say that DBP has better features, which it has, but at the price of severely limited compatibility, a boatload of bugs and the slight problem that some features have been removed due to poor implementation.<br><br>Blitz MAX was first discussed on the 'Blitz Basement', in 2001-2002 as far as I can recall... However, it was called Blitz Pro then and was just a concept.<br><br>What I understand from reading Marks worklog, is that Blitz MAX only exists as a compiler in Alpha state... It is nowhere near 'feature complete' and as Mark Sibly recently stated there are no Betas in existance, which in my opinion means that Blitz MAX is nowhere near production ready. This is my opinion based on the worklogs.<br><br>&gt;This is <br>&gt;definitely not what I wanted or expected, I expected <br>&gt;purchasing a product at least to have a useful updated <br>&gt;product, for some time to come. This is not what I am <br>&gt;seeing. <br><br>You are seeing bickering, hysteria, egos, speculation and uninformed opinion. Noone here knows what is coming, and in their infinite wisdom, many people are heating up the debate in order to stroke their own egos.<br><br>B3D doesn't magically lose the ability to create executables when Blitz MAX goes into production. It is very capable as it is, and I don't think that we will be disapointed in the future.<br><br>In the worklog, Mark Sibly writes that a DX9 update is in the cards, but will involve rewriting part of the engine. Many people here read that and think 'cool, so we'll have full DX9 support at the end of the week'... Come on, let the guy work in peace... When it's ready, we'll get to see it.  <br><br>I am not the guy with all of the answers, and I speak for myself only, so take it for what it's worth.<br><br>Andy <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I can't seem to understand how Blitz Research is making any money on this product by giving everything away.  I would have expected, say, a years worth of updates after purchasing, but to expect to get updates for free forever... well, that just seems unrealistic. (Anyone every hear of a company called Microsoft?)<br><br>Another thing seems to escape logic here and that's that obviously some Blitz Users are purchasing "Vapor Ware" or "Future Ware"???  (Excluding, of course, anyone who feels they were mislead).  But as I recall, there was a trial period to the demo, which allows you to check out the program (thoroughly) before purchasing.  When I bought it, I thought I was purchasing Blitz3D, not BlitzMAX or BlitzDX9 or Blitz2006... <br><br>Anyway, I would rather see Blitz Users paying some sort of "Annual Maintenance Fee" for the Blitz Products vs. this "One Time Gets All" concept.  Why???  Well, I'd like to know that the person (or persons) behind the future development of this product are going to KEEP developing this product.  My fear would be to come to this site one day and find that Blitz has been discontinued due to "lack of funding".  <br><br>So, to those who want everything for free, just remember... you get what you pay for. <br><br>Well, that's just my opinion...

I bought a license in 1991, and it has gone through about 200 minor and 4 major revisions since then. They FINALLY charged for an upgrade this year.

Personally I think blitzmax should be made to replace all other versions of blitz, and that us blitzer's should get a discount on it when it comes out.  I don't want to end up buying a bunch of seperate products for a single thing.<br><br>Like I started a game in 2D but using blitz3d, and not using the hardware accel features.  I realized I would probably need to purchase blitzplus, so the file size would stay down, and so i could get the gui features of blitzplus.<br><br>Since BP came out, I shouldn't have even started a 2d game in blitz3d, but now I have...  So I can release the game when it's done, in it's almost 1 meg version (because of all the b3d commands included) or I can buy B+ and recompile it get the gui commands as well as have the exe size be cut down at least in half.  And don't speak to me about upx, because there's still the same thing with that, a b3d and b+ exe would get cut in half, so then i'd have to decide 256k verses 512k (and i know those aren't exact sizes but that's the relative size difference).<br><br>I hereby in front of all the witnesses herein, do solomnly apologize for asking for a blitz3d update, when so many other people have cried for an update.

The main thing is to be patient and have faith in Mark because doing what he does isn't easy, and if it were we wouldn't be using Blitz.<br><br>I also have to say I regret that some members of this community will leave because of the lack of features Blitz currently lacks, because I belive one of Blitz's greatest strengths is it's community and losing one of the members is always bad.

Overall since the existance of Blitz Mark seems to done pretty good with the project and I imagine he will continue to do so.
