</pre><br>That's it. The screen is rendering a dozen boxes with no textures, and a few sprites with alpha blending for the interface. I get the postion of the mouse, postion a sprite there, capture the scene and render. I get loads of jitters. If I lose the tween it still jitters. If I lose the function calls, lose the captureworld(), and insert the code directly, I get jitters. If I lose the vwait and try Flip 0 and 1, the jitters are much less pronounced but still there.<br><br>There's no background music or anything. Basically doing nothing more than looping through moving a mouse pointer gives me jitters where in debug it doesn't. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It exhibits the same problem I'm experiencing in my program. Windowed it's smooth. Full screen without debug it's jittery. It's very jittery to start with, then the jitters calm down after a few seconds but still appear throughout running. It's more the mouse stopping thats the problem. In this test code the background only seems to jitter on start which I put down to initialisation. I do have periods of slight roughness in my 3D graphics of the main program though. And this test program isn't as noticeable in the problems as mine. The only real difference is a few more small alpha blended button sprites and a load of file accessing before hand to load the UI and level. <br><br>Argh, it's driving me nuts!

Unfortunately I can't ask users to disable these so even if I trace it to that, it's something I'd need to work around. The drops might be very small, but they screw up the timing of my machines and turn a level that works into one that doesn't. I've had that happen a couple of times and it'd be quite annoying/confusing to have the level solved but it not work. Also even though the 3D portion might be running without glitch, the mouse freezes are very noticeable and can cause problelms with the UI, dragging a slider only for the mouse to freeze and then appear elsewhere without moving the control.<br><br>I've just added a time-check for each loop iteration. On average I'm hitting 3 to 5 ms for each frame with all the physics and rendering (but no flip). I also catch the longest time, and some frames takes 7,8, or 9 ms. I've even had jumps to 13 and even 35 ms for a frame! It's as though the Blitz executable is being stopped by the system or something? Putting in a delay of 5 ms at first glance seems to keep these spikes in execution down to 8 ms. It'd make sense to free up time for the OS which otherwise will just take it away from the Blitx program.<br><br>I'm also using a Wacom Graphire tablet+mouse. Could it be the driver somehow loses focus which would explain the issues with the mouse freezing while the rest of the progran runs okay. I'll need to try a normal mouse and a couple other machines. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The reason was I had no router and therefor there was a firewall popup alert every other second. It seems for some reason this popup paused the millisecs counter of the machine. Or maybe it simply paused the machine due to a top priority background activity by the firewall (true vector stuff, esp. in fullscreen bitz will be paused when an other process is active), I'm not sure. However, after using a router I rarely have any firewall alerts anymore since the common attacks like port scanning, netbios knocking etc. are blocked in the router. You may try your app after unplugging the net and disabling the firewall.<br><br>Or maybe even better: set the firewall mode to "block silently" or something like that. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I can only suggest you do the same, find exactly what line is causing your periodic slowdown, and then find a fix.
