The B3dBatchExport.ms script appears to be just a "quick export" script that depends on the main plugin to work. It works in 3ds Max 9.<br><br>This is highly unfortunate. I'm sorry for wasting everyone's time.<br><br>But, on a positive note, it seems I had no problems exporting from 3ds max 2011 as a .3ds, then importing into 3ds max 9, and finally exporting as .b3d. So as long as I can do that, I'm happy.<br><br><br><br>Original, embarrassing post below<br>---------------------------------------------------------<br><br><font class="tiny"><br>I hope it is acceptable to post this here. For many Blitz3D users, this is a big deal. We all wish Pudding would update the Pipeline for newer versions of 3ds max (the latest release was for 3ds max 9, there's 4 new versions since then with amazing new features like pelt mapping).<br><br>This may not pertain <i>directly</i> to programming, but let's face it... many (probably most) of us create our own artwork, and .b3d just seems to be the only acceptable file format to work with. B3d Pipeline is the only exporter plugin for 3ds max, and unfortunately it hasn't been updated in over 3 years.<br><br>Fortunately, it seems that Pudding did release the MaxScript code along with B3d Pipeline. After doing some research, I found that MaxScript code is indeed forward compatible in most situations. The only problem is, I have very little knowledge of how MaxScript works.<br><br>The good news is that if it's forward compatible, there may not need to be any editing to the existing script. I just need help getting it executed (or compiled) from its raw format.<br><br>The source code appears to be split into 12 separate files. There are 4 .mse (encrypted, but can be executed), 1 .msr, and the rest are regular .ms format.<br><br>I have installed Visual Studio 2008 express and Windows Platform SDK. However, I can't seem to figure out how to compile the MaxScript files into a .dle plugin, or even a .mzp. That seems to be the problem here, let me explain why (from what I understand).<br><br>I attempted executing B3dBatchExporter.ms from inside 3ds max 2011. It loaded the dialog box, I got excited and selected my input/output folders, clicked Ok... and it crashed. So, I loaded up the debugger, and it detected an error on line 72:<br><br><i><b>Type error: Call needs function or class, got: undefined</b></i><br><br>The code is on that line is:<br><br><b>b3d_export B3dFile</b><br><br>Since we are all programmers, we can clearly understand what this message means: b3d_export is a function which is defined in a separate file, and was not found.<br><br>So, it seems the problem is that all of the files need to be somehow installed at once or compiled into a .dle plugin.<br><br>My next step is to attempt to find the file which defines the b3d_export function, and do an Include so that it is included. And then repeat this step for any other missing functions until I end up with a single, executable script (and then go from there).<br><br>I'm not sure if that's possible, but I will attempt it and come back with an update.<br><br>If anyone here has any experience with MaxScript, <i>please</i> add some input and let me know if updating this plugin is even a plausible idea. Because if it is, it will prove infinitely valuable to the many users like myself who are loyal to 3ds max and just cannot be forced to use the old 3ds max 9 (or simply don't have the older version).<br><br>Thank you for reading, I hope we can revive this outstanding but outdated plugin and make it a success!</font><br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font><br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font><br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The 3DS format won't store vertex normals or second UV sets and if you want to export skeletal animation, you don't have a prayer.<br><br>If you're only using static geometry (which presumably you are or you would already have noticed the skeletal animation not working) then you might try exporting to ASE with the Gile[s] exporter, loading it in Gile[s] where you can apply textures if you want and make minor adjustments, then export to B3D from Gile[s]. At least that way, you'll keep the UV coordinates and the vertex normals.<br><br>I think you'd need to go via Ultimate Unwrap in order to keep skeletal animation. There may be other options now, mind you. It's been a few years since I used B3D in any capacity. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

From your list, FBX and DAE should both definitely work, and OBJ might. FBX and DAE will (should) keep skeletal animation intact as well. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I really appreciate the responses.<br><br>Now if I can just get vertex paint to work... it works if I use a Blend material, but then it doesn't export. If I use the Blitz3D Brush material and set the vertex paint map channel to 1, I can get a result, but it's really distorted.<br><br>I will keep playing around with the options. I'm thinking it has something to do with map channels but I just can't figure it out. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
