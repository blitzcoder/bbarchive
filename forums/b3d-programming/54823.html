Most companies I've worked for have large codebases to speed development, so sometimes you might add features or perform maintenance on these libraries.  Some projects are custom solutions for specific clients and others are software that's intended to be sold to many customers later.  Some projects you'll never hear of again and others will require constant maintenance and changes.

Having been involved in the hiring process I can tell you that most programmers don't have a very good grasp on what they're doing.  The generally accepted dogma is that a great programmer is 10 times as productive as a good one; from personal experience I can tell you that a bad programmer can be a productivity liability: sapping other team members' time with questions better answered by Google and writing atrocious code which will cause all manner of expensive headaches down the road (and may even need to be rewritten!)  Very tough interviews are a necessity for the more popular languages! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

As octothorpe correctly said, *good* programmers are not that easy to come by.  There's an incredible number of weak developers out there.<br><br>What I looked for in a new hire was someone who wrote a lot of code on their own, outside the school environment.  I pretty much ignored 'school projects'.  Also I was partial to anyone who had written a game.  Maybe that's my personal prejudice, but honestly writing a game involves a lot of skills that you don't necessarily _need_ for application writing, but that can come in very handy.  It requires a different way of thinking to write a game.  Most applications are straight through top to bottom, little consideration for time it takes to run (until later, when load becomes a problem!)  <br><br>Anyway, spend your time now honing your skills.  The language doesn't so much matter (you can pick up any language if you are good).   If you have actually *completed* projects on your own, outside the school environment, especially if a game or two is involved, that counts for a lot.  In my opinion.  I think it would count even more if you were hoping to work in the gaming biz.  Most developers are worker bees.  If you've taken the initiative to start a project and more importantly complete it, that shows a skill that most applicants simply don't have.<br><br>You can make the best money, by the way, if you come up with your own internet applications, develop them, get a ton of users and then sell them.  I know, I know, if only.  But I've seen it happen many times to people I know.  They knew the idea was good, and pushed and made the software great, and weren't too proud to have people help them (a very common developer mistake is too much pride, and fear of getting help with areas they aren't masters of, like business).  <br><br>by the way it seems that C# is the new visual basic, runs almost as fast as C++ but much easier to develop in.  Easy to learn too.  It'll be popular, in fact it is being used as a 'scripting' language for major 3d engines.  I think that will continue, because the 3d engines don't want necessarily to maintain their own languages.  Learn it, its v easy.  <br><br>also if you want to work in games, i suspect that Digipen and the other schools are a very good idea.  If I was hiring game developers I'd probably look there first. <br><br>Ryan <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
