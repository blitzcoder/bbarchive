If a programmer thinks it worth their while and sees an opportunity for further development then great, if not, well of course thats fine.  For someone already earning $2000 a week, I doubt that this would interest them - but for many others looking for an opportunity or others needing extra cash then this may be an opportunity - an opportunity for a little cash and a possible business opportunity down the line.  Why deny them that choice ?<br><br>Regarding industry rates for programmers on a contract basis - these rates are dropping daily.  Why ?  because of the increasingly global nature of programming - especially off-site specification based programming.  The site that I mentioned - rentacoder.com is full of Professional coders with good track records who will work on this basis and for similar amounts - this is the upcoming trend now.  They don't consider the amount offered 'insultingly low'.  I've used the site for services rendered and its very competitive with people all over the world bidding for the same size contract - yes a 'measly' (as you see it) contract.  These are professional C++ programmers &amp; graphic artists with track records and references  BUT because Blitz3D isn't mainstream - all offers came to do the work in C++ and to learn Blitz from scratch. I wanted it in Blitz so that I could have some hope of modifying it if I so chose...<br><br>Finally, I didn't post the 'details' as they are confidential - those who wrote to me will be responded to today with an NDA and further details.

It is mutually decided amongst themselves whether the person accepting the contract is being cheated or not.<br>  A programming wanting to prove his worth, even though he realizes the money involved is below min wage would accept this challenge due to the fact of how difficult it is to break into programming.
