Store a client-side and server-side list of level version numbers, and only download if the server holds a newer version than the client.

At most you would prevent certain levels from being accessed in one large file, and should you need to update, use a patcher service.  Is this 2d/3d, a compressed file in .zip or .rar should not yeild a  "level" file that is that large, unless there is a lot of geometry and textures, and if this is the case, wouldnt you want to reuse the textures/content... any way you look at it its a bad idea....<br><br>Not to mention... if you want to charge etc(im guessing since the players dont have access to all files at once), its a bad idea to just use the http get type webserver functions as A.  You dont have permissions...  EVERYONE would be able to read the files from the directory... and if I wanted more levels, I could just type that path into my web browser and download them.  And B, there is nothing stopping someone from keeping a level that they already downloaded... atleast it would be a cat and mouse security game between you trying to prevent them, and them wanting to play...<br><br>Aside from all the negative crap I just threw at you(sorry) there are some ways to do this.  Get a dedicated server, with some decent bandwidth, and get and external network library(cant multi-thread tcp with blitz on the server side), and have it sync up with some sort of encryption and have the game code talk to the server code etc... one huge benefit of doing this would be that high scores etc would be shared between players, and you could easily make this same server a web server that posts the scores and info etc to people on the web.<br><br>I would seriously rethink this whole thing stressing some key points to your client.  They may "want" something... but there is a reason they arent coding it themselves... and bringing some of these issues to them may end up saving both of you time and frustration in the long run...<br><br>[end rant]<br><br>:) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
