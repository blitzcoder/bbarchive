They work perfectly well with all 3D hardware accelerated graphics except those with 3D rendered onto textures embedded in 3D scenes (the textures have -- incorrect -- parallax rendered into them -- needless to say the bundled game makes extensive use of rendered textures :) ) I had an earlier set of 3D glasses and they worked well but had a number of annoying pitfalls:<br><br>1) 3D objects were parallaxed but 2D overlays weren't. This caused real issues with UI overlays. The new glasses invert the parallax of 3D objects so that 2D overlays (which don't move) appear to have the largest parallax, and hence float in FRONT of rather than behind the scenery.<br><br>2) They only worked with video cards specifically designed for them (I had a bleeding edge GeForce 256 back then -- useless now, as are the glasses). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

(Sorry, but at the moment I can't recall the name of the game, but it was a 3D "asteroids" type shooter.)<br><br>I had really thought the game would have to be written with stereoscopic views in mind, but apparently the drivers for the glasses are good enough to create the separations needed for true 3D effects from just about ANY program.<br><br>Eventually, because of the aiming problem I had to turn off the glasses and just play "normally", but it was an interesting exercise.<br><br>I do plan to check out more examples and see if they work as well as this one did. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
