The game`s engine is at an advanced stage and the battle system is in development. The interfaces are mostly done and now only content is needed.<br><br>If you wanna see some screens of the game or more info about, please mail me or reply here or check our website.<br><br>Thank you,<br>KovaSteel<br><br><a href="http://triglowsoft.com.co.nr/" target="_blank">http://triglowsoft.com.co.nr/</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Because - as I'm sure you'll admit - your game looks nowhere near as good as the original Final Fantasy series and that could put people off buying those titles.<br><br>That's the argument they'd use in court, and its a very strong one.  Its highly likely they'd win, as well.  In that case, you'd have to pay a vast amount of compensation.  If you haven't got money, they'll take your belongings including your house and your car and anything else of any value.  If your family has anything of value that you benefit from, that will go as well.  So, bye-bye television set etc.  You *could* end up bankrupt.<br><br>Change the name now - you're skating on very thin ice.  It simply is not worth the risk. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'm the first to criticise team requests that are essentially "hello, i've just bought blitz, i don't know anything about it but I'd like to make a game just like Halo/Morrowind/GTA3/Elite. I'll need people to do programming, modelling, textures, sound, music and networking.. I'll just be in charge and tell you all what to do." I can understand why people tell them to go away and come back when they've got something to demonstrate ability/commitment/seriousness.<br><br>I just think it's a bit mean when they do that and they still get criticised. It's hard to judge from the screenshots, but speaking as someone who would like to write an RPG one day, it looks like quite a lot of work has been done to me. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
