Much. B3d's are animated "on-the-fly". In other words, all the vertices are moved according to the bones in real time, and it's pretty slow in software.<br><br>MD2's on the other hand are precalculated. All the vertex positions each frame are calculated and stored in the file. It's MUCH faster to use MD2's.<br><br>However, there are a lot of drawbacks to the MD2 also. Lighting doesn't affect MD2's as it should. They suffer from wobbling vertices. They work best for low, low poly models ( under 1,000 ideally. )<br><br>To sum up in a little sound bite, if you want a lot of sub-1000 poly characters on screen, and you won't see them up close often, MD2 is a solid choice. If you are going to see characters close up, and/or the polycount is higher, you'd probably best stick with b3d. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If the worst thing you have to worry about your game is related to using MD2s then you're WAAAAY ahead of most Blitz3D games. In the meantime, there are a bazillion ways to create MD2s from almost any decent 3D tool you can think of, whereas producing nicely animated B3Ds requires highly specific workflows. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

These are way beyond the quality of what most of us are working with :)<br><br>If B3Ds did support mesh deformation with higher precision vertex coordinates then you could have the convenience of MD2 without the vertex wobble.<br><br>As for recalculating vertex normals, that's not really an intrinsic limitation of MD2 (all the vertex normals of a skeletally deformed mesh need to be recaclulated too); there's no particular reason why the engine can't recalculate vertex normals for MD2s (or simply interpolate them).
