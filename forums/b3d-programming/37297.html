You still render as many times as you can, but depending on how fast the cpu is it'll be less than 30 times or more than 30 times.(upto60 if you're gpu supports it)..the anims are tweened, so they stay in sync too. But whatever the case, the logic is updated 30 times per second. (So the gameplay is the same on a p800 as it is on a p3ghz, only the p800 one will be more jerky)<br><br>so 30fps = less cpu overheads = more frames rendered than 60fps...hence a lot of people say 30is the best. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You could use some kind of fake interlaced Frames in BLitz too, this would give you a touch of motion blur, All you need to do is: Instead of a simple Flip to show the latest render, you will have to copy the backbuffer to some imagebuffer, where it is secure, then copyrect every odd line of that imagebuffer to the frontbuffer. While you are rendering the next frame, you have to draw the even lines after the half frametime has passed by. If you swap this every time (one time the odd lines first, the next time the even lines first), you may get a nice interlaced feeling. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I know this statement, it is a scientific insight of the time when they tried to find the optimal framerate for movies. The point is: when you record a movie and the lense is open of 33 ms, then you have the whole motion of 33ms on one frame, thus motionblur. Now when you have 30 FPS with full 33ms motionblur recording, you won't see the diffrence to 60hz with 16.6ms motionblurred recording. Or at least the average human eyes won't see the diffrence.<br><br>Of course, this is not the same like crystalclear rendered Pictures without any motionblur. There you can easily see the diffrence up to Famerates beyond 100 fps, although you need a refreshrate on the monitor that is high enough, otherwise you'll always be limited to the physical framerate. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In the 1960's some Hollywood types did a study on this and eventually invented a process called SHOWSCAN. This process was a method of showing film at an incredibly high rate of speed (I think 124FPS) at this rate the brain became more highly involved with the image and thus the image became more REAL to them... Test films of a rollercoaster or a Car Crash had people getting physically ill in the theater. The process was discontinued.<br><br>The IMAX images are supposed to be shown at something like 80fps I think... The images are both bigger and faster than you are used to processing film images so the experience seems more real... I find the flicker in the films very annoying.<br><br>Recently the process has become interesting to new people as with the advent of the micro-digital age we can show images as fast as we need...

The human eye can be fooled into seeing fluid motion at almost any framerate. <br>The eye begins to detect fluid motion at about 12 frames/sec. <br>Movies are (typically) filmed at 24 frames/sec. I don't think anyone can complain that the movies they watch are 'jerky' (except maybe for some action films where they are using a high shutter speed). <br>It SEEMS (large emphasis on 'seems') that games/consoles/computers need to display images at high framerates to give the impression of fluid motion. This is only partially true. <br>Faster framerates WILL appear smoother and smoother. And at some point (70+) the eye can no longer distinguish between frames. <br>A misconception about all this is that the 70+ is NECESSARY. It is not. Film framerates (24/sec.) prove this. <br><br>Here's the difference: <br><br>When filming movies, the camera shutter is open for a certain amount of time (1/24th of a second) and all motion during that 1/24th second is blurred into one image. So one FRAME actually contains all the events that have happened during that 1/24th of a second. <br><br>When a game/console/computer displays a frame (lets go with 24/sec. to keep the comparison even) TIME IS STOPPED for that frame. It shows us what happened at that time as if we had a camera with a shutter speed of something like 1/1,000,000 of a second. The majority of the information for the remainder of that 1/24th of a second is missing. <br><br>What we end up with for the film is 24 frames that contain 100% (1 second) of data. <br>What we end up with for the game is 24 frames that contain 24 instantaneous screenshots of what happened in that second. <br><br>So... <br>When playing back the film, 100% of the second is replayed and looks smooth and fluid. <br>When playing back the game, 24 still images are flashed before our eyes and one of two things happens: <br>1. If the amount of motion between the 24 images is small enough, it will appear fluid. <br>2. If the amount of motion between the 24 images is too great, it will appear 'jerky'. In fact this is still completely possible even if the framerate is extremely high. <br><br>Games/Consoles/Computers are CAPABLE however of displaying fluid motion with low framerates even if the amount of motion is great. In fact they already do. Many, many games come with intro movies that do just that. Regardless of what framerate the movie is playing at, it looks fluid. <br><br>The question here is how does the game do it while rendering in-game screenshots? <br>What it has to accomplish is displaying 100% (or close to it) of the information during every second. It can do this in one of two ways: <br>1. EXTREMELY HIGH FRAMERATES displaying more and more of all the events that happened during the second. (This is what games are trying to accomplish right now and what many gamers think NEEDS to be done) <br>2. PROVIDE THE MISSING INFORMATION. It's the more difficult one to do but has better results. There is more than one way to accomplish this. Some graphic cards now can blur action by taking the last two frames and combining them to display a third blurred image. Another method (and one that I haven't seen implemented yet) is to use an algorithm to diplay an image that is the result of an object in it's initial position at the beginning of the 1/24th sec. and ending position at the end of the 1/24th sec. and all of the pixels in between the two (This may be hard to comprehend or visualize). Kind of like drawing a 'streak' as opposed to a static image. <br><br>I hope now you realize that high framerates aren't NECESSARY to display fluid motion. They are only one solution. <br>A 30 fps clip CAN LOOK JUST AS FLUID AS A 60 FPS CLIP for the reasons I stated above. It all depends on how much of the information is contained in those 30 or 60 frames. <br>And in the same respect a 60 fps clip can look more 'jerky' than a 30 fps clip. <br><br>Take care all. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Thats not true, animators often add motion blur, you never seen "Road Runner"?<br><br>But, of course you can animate at 4 FPS if you want as long as you 'hint' at the intended movement/action.<br><br>Try doing a camera whip pan in 4 FPS - you can do it, as long as you 'hint' at it: character looks off camera, 2 frames of blurry streaky horizontal lines, to next shot.<br><br>But, thats the thing about animation, its a series of codes designed to minimise the amount of drawing/work required.<br><br>But, much of that doesn't apply to 3d games, for several reasons.<br><br>a) the author can't direct the visuals when the player is in control of the camera.<br>b) if you had 4 FPS in an action game you may miss some crucial piece of action between 2 of those frames!  Even at 30 FPS.  This is doubly true when you have game systems running at different rates, graphics, network updates, game logic.  Trying playing an online war game at those frame rates, you will often wonder how you died.<br><br>I don't think you can deny that motion blur benefits the smooth movement in film.  That just seems like arguing for the sake of it.  Of tourse it won't matter if the camera is locked off on a sedate scene, but throw in some action or some high speed camera moves and you will notice it (or the lack of it - ever seen digitally added in camera movement without added motion blur? looks very odd and doesn't 'read' at all).  <br><br>The only reasons some film was projected at less than 24 FPS was because of cost of materials and because at the time the cameras/projectors/film stock were invented they didn't know any better.<br><br>TVs might not rely on the 50/60 hz refresh that they used to but the video they display does, and still contains double frames in the form of the interlaced fields.<br><br>You could argue that you don't need any frames per second to know something has moved.  Think about it, an object is in one position and then miraculously is in another.  You know it has moved, probably very fast.  That doesn't mean to say that it moved smoothly or in a way that we experience in real life. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The whole discussion here is about whether (some) games need high frame rates.  I argue that they do.  Do you disagree on the grounds that animation makes do with 12 FPS?<br><br>Why does TV and film use higher than 12 FPS?  It doesn't need it, by your own argument. Maybe we should watch films in flick-book form only, or maybe even that is too much, picture books anyone?<br><br>The drawn motion blur isn't there for mere eyecandy, it lets us know what has happened in the action.<br><br>You ask if it looks like real motion blur, I say "yes, to a child or adult caught up in illusion of the animation".  Of course, technically it doesn't, but then neither does Mickey look like a mouse, and nothing looks real if only cos real things don't have outlines. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
