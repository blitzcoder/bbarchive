</pre><br><br>Whilst it would need some careful work in setting up and understading the limited syntax, The advantage here, is that repeated functions, such as those that check for objects etc. need not be repeatedly parsed in entirety. A range of operator types and comparison types can be converted in B3D with something like:<br><br><br><pre class=code>
Function ScriptValue(ValueReference%,Value%)
    CurrentScriptFunctionValues(ValueReference%)=Value%; Making use of a a global array
End Function

Function Comparison%(ComparisonType,Comparison_Value_1%,Comparison_Value_2%)
    ;in a sense, this is similar to how one might overload operators, though of course, we're not actually using the b3D operators.
    ;Some predefined constants
    Select (ComparisonType)
 Case CON_COMP_TYPE_ADD: Return CurrentScriptFunctionValues(Comparison_Value_1%)+CurrentScriptFunctionValues(Comparison_Value_2%)
 Case CON_COMP_TYPE_SUBTRACT: Return CurrentScriptFunctionValues(Comparison_Value_1%)-CurrentScriptFunctionValues(Comparison_Value_2%)

In other words, a construct such as<br><br>SomeFunction (ftos (num1), ftos (num2));<br>will fail because the second call to ftos (which converts a floating-point value to a string) overwrites the string returned by the first call before SomeFunction can do something with it.

The simplest kind of VM then simply iterates over this list of instructions, and chooses an action for each one.<br><br>eg.<br><br><pre class=code>a = a + b</pre><br><br>might, given the right compiler, turn into<br><br><pre class=code>
load 0
load 1
add
store 0
</pre><br><br>for a stack machine, or simply<br><br><pre class=code>
add a b a
</pre><br><br>for a three-address code random access machine. Part of the fun is deciding on the machine model - stack-based is simplest (and easiest to use with complex tasks like OOP), random-access is fastest for software interpretation, register-based is closest to how a real CPU works. (Note that the point of bytecode is that you'd still be representing these as integer constants, not as strings.)<br><br>Choosing the action could be as simple as this:<br><br><pre class=code>
Select instr
    Case add
        ; (Do whatever add operation)
    Case sub
        ; (Subtract operation)
    Case mul
        ; (Multiply operation)
    Case div
        ; (Division operation)
    ...
    Case call
        ; Call a native function
End Select
</pre><br><br>...although Select isn't optimised in B3D so it's not the fastest way to do this (using a binary chop - "if instr &gt; MIDPOINT then if... else if ..." has time complexity O(log n) rather than O(n) ).<br><br>The important part is being able to access native functions: you can have machine codes for the really common ones (no reason to limit yourself to machine codes used on your CPU), and leave others flexible. I would do this by assigning each function a UID and then having another select structure within the "call" instruction; in other languages (or with the help of a userlib) function pointers would be good for this, too. Anyway, somewhere there has to be a way of registering your B3D functions with the VM, otherwise it can't do anything useful in the main program.<br><br>Err... I'm not sure I understand what you mean by "conversion" or "duplicated".<br><br><br>EDIT: Ah, I wouldn't bother about the QuakeC parameter issue - that's because QuakeC was - in my opinion - implemented really badly, using a totally counterintuitive VM that couldn't store temporary variables - no implications for other scripting languages. What they mean is that you had to do this:<br><br><pre class=code>
temp1 = myQCFunction(a, b, c);
temp2 = myQCFunction(d, e, f);
result = myOtherFunction(temp1, temp2, X, Y);
</pre><br>rather than<br><pre class=code>
result = myOtherFunction(myQCFunction(a, b, c), myQCFunction(d, e, f), X, Y);
</pre><br>... like you can in B3D and any serious language, because the second call to myQCFunction would overwrite the parameters of the first, and the result. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The use of identifying specific memory pointers for the functions would be crucial as you say, to making a script "truly integrated", however, when faced with the fact that once compiled, all the functions and procedurality is quite 'distorted' due to being compiled and condensed into their machine code equivalents, soeven if the RAM memory locations could be identified, not only would they be inconsistent, but also, promne to issues with use of the paging file, maybe?<br><br>Therefore I opt for a less ideal idea,  but one that should still warrwant the same level of "understanding" by the main app. So I am still converting what is read as "bytecode" into a format to be parsed into various functions which can action the script functions/commands "almost as efficiently"(I would hope) as a standard default function of the main app itself.<br><br>_________<br><br><br>When I say 'conversion' and 'duplication', I mean for example that a function in the script might be something along the lines of:<br> (just a kinda pseudocode, but hopefully eequivalent to my earlier examples) <br><pre class=code>
Function CheckBullet(Bullet,Object)
If Collided(Bullet,Object) Then DecreaseHealth(Object,1)
If (GetHealth(Object)&lt;1) Then Kill(Object)
End Function
</pre><br><br>For this to be interpreted and actioned in the main code, it would be converted too a format as suggested kinda reminiscent of Assembly or such, however, in doing so, it would also strip away any kind of "individuality" or identity of the function. <br>If the script contains something like this:<br><pre class=code>
Function CheckTimeLimit(Bomb,Object)
If (FuseLit(Bomb)) Then DecreaseTime(Bomb,1)
If (TimeLeft(Bomb)&lt;1) Then TimeOver(Object)
End Function
</pre><br>essentially, it's identical, but would be parsed entirely by the intepreter and therefore duplicating where only one function framework is really needed:<br><pre class=code>A_Function(Ref)
If (Boolean(Ref1)=True) Then Operator(Ref,Val)
If (SubFunction(Ref))&lt;1) Then CallFunction(Function(Ref))
End Function
</pre><br>In typically available 'scripting'  libraries (I am talking specifically those desinged for Blitz3D ) this duplication bloats the code, slows it down and makes for a lot of unncecessary string-checking.<br>In my proposition, the interpreting of the script would know that it's the same thing, since "Laser" and "Bullet" are just some form of handle/label/reference. When the script is parsed, all the 'engine' needs to know is:<br><br>Arguments-2 Reference1 (Tye=object reference), Reference2 (type=object reference)<br><br>Function<br>:: FIRST ALL THE DATA AND DATATYPES ARE 'DECLARED'::<br>---Values=3<br>------Value1 (bool)<br>------Value2 (int)<br>------Value3 (int)<br>------Value4 (int)=1<br>------Value5 (int)=1<br>------Value6 (bool)<br>---Operations=2<br>------CollisionCheck(bool)<br>------IntegerManipulation(int)<br>------IntegerComparison(bool)<br>------Actions=2<br>---------CallFunction<br>---------CallFunction<br>:: THIS IS TEH ACTUAL GUTS OF TEH FUNCTION::<br>---Operator<br>---What Operation?<br>------Boolean<br>------What Boolean?<br>---------CollisionCheck<br>---------What Am I Operating?<br>------------Reference1<br>------------Reference2<br>------------Where Do I Put The Result?<br>---------------Value1<br>------True?<br>---------Action<br>---------What Action?<br>------------CallFunction<br>------------What Am I Actioning?<br>---------------GetHealth(Reference2)     //Okay this makes things a little more complex but still, you get the idea :)<br>---------------Where Do I Put The Result?<br>------------------Value2<br>---------Operator<br>---------What Operation?<br>------------Integer Manipulation<br>------------What Integer Manipulation?<br>---------------Subtraction<br>---------------What Am I Operating?<br>------------------Value3<br>------------------Value4 ( = 1 )<br>------------------Where Do I Put The Result?<br>---------------------Value3<br>------False?<br>---------{NOP}<br>------{End Boolean}<br>---Operator<br>---What Operation?<br>-----Boolean<br>---------What Boolean?<br>------------IntegerComparison<br>------------What IntegerComparison?<br>---------------LessThan<br>---------------What Am I Operating?<br>------------------Value3<br>------------------Value5 ( = 1)<br>------------------Where Do I Put The Resullt?<br>---------------------Value6<br>------True?<br>---------Action<br>---------What Action?<br>------------CallFunction<br>------------What Am I Actioning?<br>------------KillObject(Reference2)<br>------False?<br>---------{NOP}<br>---------{End Boolean}<br>EndOfFunction<br><br><br><br>So in a byte-wise sense, say, 65536 individual UNIQUE steps of the process above could be represented, as in assembly. The process is remarkably procedural, though perhaps some problems may occur with more complex functions and nested loops / conditionals etc.<br><br>For example, "Where Do I Put The Result?" might be given a value of '16',  it doesn;t really matter WHAT value this is, only that the same value will always apply, and ONLY apply to the step "Where Do I Put The Result?" the following ("STANDARD DEFAULT NUMBER OF BYTES") byte(s) will identify the answer to that question specifically for each situation. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
