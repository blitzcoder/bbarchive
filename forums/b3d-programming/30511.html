Or, you could find one that someone else wrote, perhaps.  I remember seeing a file called "nhook.dll" in one of the programs I use which I assume was something like this (I examined the exported functions), but I can't remember what program that came from, and whether it was freely distributable, etc.<br><br>Perhaps someone else knows some other tips. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

What if i needed 6 or 10 different keypresses to do 10 different things when pressed?  would the code for checking that go into the code in the blitz3d .bb which is between the hook and unhook calls?  explain why the bank has to have a size of 40.  would that number have to increase?  where would i put the actual keypress checks, do i put it within the hook and unhook area?  will the blitz program (the .exe generated) then check for keypresses even if that program is not the focus?  like i said, i don't have powerbasic so i can't create the actual hookbb.dll and would have no way to test this in action.  plus, then i need to learn the syntax for powerbasic which may or may not be like blitz3d and costs another $199.00 for a licensed version.  i almost feel guilty that you put this time into this and yet i can't even try to use it.  i apologize and hope that we can try this again somehow and also i am still looking for other methods as well.  also, i am wondering if someone else has put together a blitz3d hook .dll like peter that is already compiled and ready for download.  this has been quite the learning experience the last couple weeks.<br><br>best,<br>mike <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You'll have to take it from here yourself. The above dll is does not copy the keystrokes to a bank. Copying the keystokes the bank(buffer), passed in the hook function would be an easy way to do it. If you want to make your dll safe to use with multiple Blitz3D apps running at a time, you should look into SetWindows long, and store a pointer to your apps buffer. Using global or static variables in a dll, will not make it thread safe. Good luck. I see that some people are using Purebasic for this kind of stuff. It's a lot cheaper than PowerBasic, but you can do the same thing with a free C compiler like lcc or similar. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
