And thus I came accross this one! However though, I've noticed a few problems with it since I downloaded it! I will list them as follows:<br><br>1.) The EPS Particle System Editor when it writes out the<br>    blitz source code, It only writes out just the particle<br>    commands and their associated parameters only!!<br>    It doesn't write out a complete working blitzbasic<br>    program to run as most blitzbasic editors do now a days.<br><br>2.) The actual source code to the EPS editor is inclosed<br>    with the actual zip file, Which means that an individual<br>    could actually modify the code to suit his or her needs.<br>    However though, The source code also requires the<br>    include file for the BCF 2.0 Gui system as well which<br>    isn't included with the EPS Particle System download!<br>    However though I realize that an individual could<br>    download this seperatly though, But shouldn't have to<br>    in this case!! The BCF 2.0 Gui system include file<br>    should be included with the EPS system download file!<br><br>3.) It also appears that if you goto compile the source code<br>    of the EPS Particle System Editor.. That at it's current<br>    state in which it came from the zip file in all, That<br>    you wouldn't be able to compile it due to the fact that<br>    it is missing the BCF 2.0 include file which it has to<br>    have for the Gui in which it was written for! If you add<br>    the BCF 2.0 include file from a seperate download in<br>    all, you would be able to compile it. But there would<br>    still be errors with it because once you compile the<br>    source code into an executable file and then run it.<br>    Everything comes up ok except when you goto <b>Open</b><br>    to select a setting file, as soon as you click on the<br>    <b>Open</b> button... You get a <b>memory access<br>    violation</b> error message!!! However though, When you<br>    run the source code with the debugger on... It say's<br>    <b>Directory does not Exist</b> and the<br>    Path$ ="C:image\flare4.bmp in the function<br>    <b>bcf_readfolder</b> function ?!?<br><br>I've corrected the part in the code to include a complete<br>BlitzBasic program including the particle commands and<br>their associated parameters when you want to write out<br>the source code and all... The only problem is it appears to<br>be looking for a directory somewhere other than that directory where all the presets are and the image files!<br><br>Eole... Is there anyway you can distribute the EPS Particle System zip file with it being complete??? I mean...<br>Can you make it to where the EPS editor looks within the same directory where the preset's &amp; image directories is?<br>And while you might be at it in all... Can you make the<br>necessary changes to where the EPS Editor writes out a<br>complete blitzbasic program along with the EPS Particle<br>Sytem commands and parameters? This would make it alot more easier for us all if you could. I think your EPS Particle<br>System has alot of potiental in all... But it would be nice<br>if these changes where corrected on this! But I fealt I should post this as I believe others had some similar<br>problems with it like wise! Please feel free to email me on this if you like!
