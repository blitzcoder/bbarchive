Signs that this is the case include highlighting the line above the "stop" (dead giveaway), things happening in the side panel before the cursor has moved over that line, and the wrong number of characters being highlighted (e.g. stopping in the middle of a word).<br><br>I eventually came to the conclusion that this is somehow connected to the fact that end-of-line is represented by two characters; if only the CR is present, the debugger loses count of the line (if only the LF is present, the program plain doesn't work, but this has never happened to me outside of intentionally testing it).<br><br>Anyway, having identified the problem, it's easy to fix: close the file from the editor, open it up in <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">Notepad++</a> or something similar that provides line ending conversion, and convert the document to Mac format and back to Windows format (or turn on Show All Symbols and hunt for it by hand - this is how I found it).<br><br>The question is: what's causing this? The problem seems to occur in the course of regular editing, as I don't change editors in the middle of a project (except, as detailed above, to correct this problem if it appears). It definitely happens in IDEal, and I'm pretty sure I remember it affecting the default IDE as well. My best guess is that something is wrong with cut-and-paste...?<br><br>Anyway, it's not a big deal, but in the event this was confusing anyone else, there's one possible solution. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This finally worked (or didn't work, depending on how you look at it.)  Ctrl-Enter seems the same as Enter, Alt-Enter doesnt seem to do anything, but Shift-Enter looks like it does the same as enter, however it generates the error in question (so it's not being recognized by the debugger even though it displays as enter).<br><br>I distinctly remember this happening in the default ide, but it does not reproduce the error for me when the text is cut and pasted in.  (although it is not actually showing the highlighting for some reason, just the curson placement.  I have no idea why.)  However, if I hit debug compile in Ideal with an error that Ideal itself won't catch (like a=0:b=5/a) the default ide lauches and displays the error at the incorrect spot.<br><br>So maybe it never was in the default ide, but we've seen it displayed there in debug compile.  Or maybe there are other causes, or an update fixed it in the default ide.  Or something else.<br><br>Solution: put some gibberish on a line in your code, put it to the clipboard including the carriage return, keep pasting it up or down until you find the offending line (undoing after each run).  When you're on the right one you may get two lines highlighted.  This is because the ide thinks it's all one line.  Just select from the end of the offending line to the beginning of the next and replace with Enter.<br><br>When I did this to my current project (errors several lines off the mark!) in one case the offending line was a comment, and the error wasn't even recognized!  The program ran without errors, with the gibberish line right there.  That was weird.  It thought the gibberish was part of the comment.  In another case the offending line was an If statement.  I got an "Endif without If" error on the Endif, not on the gibberish line.<br><br>Anyways,<br><br>BTW, I think this is also the cause of the infuriating "why isn't this line working" bug.  The line is after a comment and shift-enter and is being interpreted as a comment.  Ring a bell? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
