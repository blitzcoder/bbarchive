If you are going to do just .X or something I think you might get away with using Bools. If you want to do .Map or another BSP type pre-processed format then you will need to be careful about how you create your geometry.<br><br>My suggestion, if you're going to use gameSpace then ask this question on the gs forums (http://www.caligari.com/gamespace) and check out the level creation tutorial over there as well. Several authors of level format exporters hang out on those forums and may have advice for you that is slightly more actionable than what you learned from the post above mine.<br>Cheers,<br>M <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I use this too to blow holes into walls with explosives. Simply model a wall or floor that is made of several fragments from beginning on. You can use cubes for each fragment, and then only move the vertices to make the shapes of the fragments look non-uniformly. Then you can animate it. In your case, the fragments will fall down. You could then add some code in Blitz that will hide the fragments (they are children of the animation mesh) after the animation is played. For this you needed to name them in a useful way, eg. fragm3. Using countchildren, EntityName and Instr would help to handle all fragments.<br>But of course, you could also let them fall down completely code-driven. This way it would also be possible to create unique effects using random values. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I then use the autoUV mapping for lofted objects to map the walls along the spline with enough iterations to make the polys square. <br><br>You can duplicate the original floor plan spline and convert it to a planar mesh and use this for the floor and ceiling. and slice the wall where you want the doorway to be end extrude thickness in the doorway. often do something similar with windows too. <br><br>this way you can quickly flesh out a level, assign vertex lighting and check it out for scale and gameplay before you spend too much time on making it look pretty.<br><br>The most important tools I find for optimizing the geometry are the snap tools that allow you to drag weld vertices by snapping to other verts in the model, the slice tool for slicing the walls, and the shift dragging of edges to extrude the edge of a wall if I want to modify the shapes rooms after having worked on them somewat.<br><br>thats some of the basic techniques I use that you may be able to emulate in gamespace. there are a bunch of other tools and tricks you can use after this to maintain your UV mapping and quickly fleshing out more detail. <br><br>Another thing you have to consider when building a level is how subdivided the polys have to be to get lit properly. If your just using dynamic lights and vertex colours you need a fairly dense mesh to get nice lighting, particularly in interiors.<br><br>You need to avoid long thin triangles, if your doing a lot of cutting and booleans you usually end up with a nasty mess of weird untidy triangles that are long and thin and not well ordered. Particularly on more organic objects, and because blitz dynamic lights are per vertex rather than pixel, if you use shinyness in your brush you will notice anomalities if you arent carefull about how you arange the polys, so for the most part fat tris are best.<br><br>If you can avoid it, never use maplet, it makes the dirtiest, worst meshes I have ever seen.<br><br>hope that helps, maybe you can find similar techniques in Gamespace.<br><br>Oh forgot to mention, if your using lightmaps, you can use really quite large polys, so long as you don't go crazy with shinynes in your brushes. And if your trying to get detailed levels to run on low spec machines you will need low poly invisible colision, and use the detail geometry for visuals only, and do all gameplay interaction picks etc on the invisible collision, <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Like wallA_2_100, WallA_3_150 (each one being further along the destroyed state)<br><br>and have them swapped out each time. If your just using dynamic lighting you can use instances of the same object all over your level that reference the same object and have them share the same surface. If your using lightmaps its a lot more expensive as you need a seperate wall section for each location your destructible object sits in due to the unique lightmap on each.<br><br>Not realy sure how much flexibility you will have with gamespace, but you will be able to create names for your geometry that can be used as handles for your engine to read and instruct it how to handle various aspects of these named objects. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
