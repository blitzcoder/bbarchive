B3D allows me to have a completely artistic vision of the game and only worry about graphical and gameplay aspects, keeping coding, albeit as complex as you want, to a level where you don't really have to worry about it that much or <b>don't need others to do that work for you</b>. That way you can easily be producing every aspect of your project, from audio to graphic and gameplay\programming, keeping it truly <b>yours</b> and without bias from your original design.<br><br>Seriously, I'm grateful for it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I don't want to really deviate from the topic's line of thought, but anyway:<br>I managed to "break" the contest's deadline while uploading it to the web and delivered the game 1.5 hours late, so it got disclassified from the competition (it even had money prizes =/ ). So you can see how I feel about all the hard work taken into it.<br><br>Like Adam said, the water is just a cubemapped texture (256x256), applied to a segmented mesh (created in a modelling application), and that "ripple reflection" effect you can easily get from <b>perturbing the normals of each of the vertices of that mesh in senoidal directions</b>, which required a bit of testing to get it right. That same senoidal frequency I also use to wave these vertices in the Y axis for that "physical" ripple effect too.<br><br>Back on to the topic:<br>If it weren't for B3D I wouldn't have learned all the techniques and artistical needs to accomplish this work! :D<br><br>Cya. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Keep in mind that the maze should be 60x60 or smaller (enter a value between 2 and 60 in the generator), otherwise the mesh becomes too big and generates a MAV, as DX7 can only handle meshes of 65535 vertices per mesh.<br>It also generates the floor and some spinning coins for you to find and pick up.<br>Press spacebar to disable gravity and press z or s to go up and down respectively, so you can see the maze from above. Hit spacebar again to enable gravity.<br>Use the arrow-keys to move forward/backward/left/right and use the mouse to rotate the view.<br><br>A maze of size 60 runs at full speed (60fps) on my machine, while the other rendering-engine for VB6 was only running at 3fps for a size 10 maze.<br><br>A tip: you can also print the Maze.bmp on a piece of paper and solve the maze by hand. It has only one way to get to the exit.<br><br>I couldn't have done this in another programming tool as fast as I did it with B3D. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Because I can do almost anything of my projects (as you've seen in that demo), and don't need to input other people's opinion if I don't want to.
