But I realize I am not sure how the blitz system work, and I havenot worked with sounds on computers since a looong time ago.<br><br>Here is what I plan doing for managing sounds, please tell me if it is the correct way to do it:<br>What I think I'm going to do is create an array of sound channels (something like20) with each channel being specialized in one type of sound.<br>For example, 2 channels for music playback, 2 for interface sounds, 2 for player sounds, 5 for enemy generated sounds,etc..<br>Is this the correct way to do it?<br>I realize that I don't really understand how sound channels work.<br>Can you just fire a sound (creating a channel) and then just forget that channel, and use new ones for every played sounds? Or is it better to reuse sound channels for following sound?<br>Is there a limit in the number of channels you can create simultaneously (or not)?<br>I would appreciate any help in that matter. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

All it does is just give you the channel number so you can control it after it has started to play.<br><br>If you want to limit the amount of channels being used, you should proceed with the array thingy. If you run out of channels and need to replace some sound with another, you need to stop the old channel which is playing and the start the other. The new sound starts on another channel, which is a little stupid. But this solution has one advantage: pause game. If you wish that sounds pause for the time user has paused the game, it's easy to just go through the array and pause to sounds, and of course resume them when pause is over.<br><br>I've tried searching the forums for the upper limit of simultanous sounds, but haven't found anything solid. Some suggested that it was over a thousand sounds. I'm not sure since I hear sounds getting cut off with my current project. Might be a bug in my code, but also might not. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So I would never let an object play more than a couple of sounds at a time. Of course if you've got 100s of objects on screen this could be a problem. But if you know you're never going to have more than 5 or 10 on screen you shouldn't run into problems.<br><br>Also if you've got voice you'll probably only want to have one channel for that and create a type that is the queue. Then you have an check that sees if the voice channel is playing, if it's not then go to the next item in the queue etc etc etc. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
