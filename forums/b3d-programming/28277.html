Here's my case:<br><br>I have a "pointcloud" - random bunch of points in 3D space, typically 100 or so but can be few hundred and sometimes less than 100. Points are static after generation, so they can be put in types / banks or whatever to make the search faster. <br><br>What I need is the ability to find the two closest points to the "camera" in each frame and their relative distances (both distances together = 100%).<br><br>And what would be fastest way to do small (maybe 16*16) bitmap color value blend (two bitmaps indexed with the pointcloud) using above percentages... <br><br>What I have in mind is sort of pointcloud that marks the spots for these 16*16 "particles". <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You can then dtermine which grid square a point is in simply by dividing it's position by the grid resolution and discarding the remainder.  Ie, divide by 64, and use Floor().<br><br>Then you can examine only those points which are in the same region of the grid as the camera.<br><br>Granted, this will require three divides per point minimum, and three calls to Floor() but it avoids an IF statement to dtermine if a point's distance is less than that of the last point checked.  I'm not sure if it will in fact be faster though.<br><br>I dunno if you realise it, but you don't need to do a square root to find the two closest points to the camera.  All you need to do is this.  This should be more than fast enough for even 100,000 points.<br><br>; Set these values as appropriate given the scale of your world.  They should be larger than whatever the greatest distance you think a point will ever be from your camera.<br>Pd1# = 65536<br>Pd2# = 65536<br><br>For Point = 0 to Total_Points-1<br><br>   ; Get Point's xyz here.<br><br>   D# = Px#*Px# + Py#*Py# + Pz#*Pz#<br><br>   If D# &lt; Pd1# <br><br>      If D# &lt; Pd2# <br><br>         Pd2# = D#<br>         P2 = Point<br>         <br>      else<br><br><br>         Pd1# = D#<br>         P1 = Point<br><br>      endif<br><br>   endif<br><br>next<br><br>Now, you can just compute the distance of P1 and P2 from the camera normally if you need it.  And this loop goes through all the points only once, so it's linear in speed which means it's pretty fast.  And there's no square root.<br><br>Ps:<br>When I say Px#*Px#, what I was assuming was the camera is centered at 0,0,0.

The worse the approximation the faster it will be.<br><br>I would not bother concerining myself with it though unless you're doing it hundreds, perhaps thousands, or even tens of thousands of times a loop.  I use squared distances when I can to compare two distances, but when I need a true distance I use a square root, and I don't worry about it unless I actually detect that my game is running too slowly and then I look for places I can make big optimizations.  So if I had a loop running 100,000 times a frame with a square root in it I might look at using an approximate distance function, but more likely I'd try to find a way not to run that loop 100,000 times instead. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
