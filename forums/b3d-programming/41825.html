For others confused, I found this on the GameStudio site:<br><div class="quote"> Q. What are the differences between a 3D Engine, a 3D Language and a 3D Authoring System? <br><br>A. A 3D Engine is a library of 3D graphics functions. Many 3D engines are available on the Internet, some are free, some are between $50 and $250,000 for commercial use. 3D engines require programming with an external delevopment system, normally Microsoft Visual C++. Programming a game around a 3D engine offers a maximum of flexibility, but requires also a maximum of experience, work and time to be invested before something's moving in your game.<br><br>An easier approach is offered by some 3D Languages. You are programming a DirectX interface with a scripting language that is especially designed for 3D games. Such languages don't offer the speed and flexibility of a 3D engine, but avoid a lot of problems related to 'real' programming. Many 3D languages use Basic, which is relatively easy to learn, but not very well suited for large or complex games due to it's ancient language structure. Better suited for ambitious projects are modern C- or Javascript-based languages. <br><br>The easiest way to create a game is using an Authoring System, which has it's own 3D engine and a visual editor for very fast 'clicking together' a game prototype. Of course, only simple games can be created without any programming. Thus authoring systems normally also provide a scripting language for programming or customizing the game. With an authoring system, a game can be created in a fraction of the time that would be needed for programming around a separate 3D engine. Due to this advantage, many major game companies begin to use authoring systems like GameStudio/A6 for their game development.<br><br>Some simple authoring systems are specialized on FPS (first or third person shooters) and offer no or limited scripting. Although even the FPS created with them are not exactly the state of the art, they could be a good alternative if you don't want to script and are not interested in publishing a game commercially. Most authoring systems however can be used for creating every type of game or 3D application. <br></div><br>I'm still a bit in the dark though - for instance I can't understand why engines offer more flexibility than a language: I would have thought languages offer far more subtlety... guess I'm just not getting it.<br><br>By the way, is B3D compiled to machine code, or interpreted (or compiled to an intermediate form)? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you write this yourself then you<br>will be able to design it specifically for the game you<br>are writing.  You will only need to code the features<br>you want it to have and you have almost total control over<br>how they are implemented.  <br><br>In Torque you already have code for handling physics, networking<br>etc.  Depending upon the style of game you are creating there may<br>require many changes to code/scripts or only a few in Torque.  For<br>example changing Torque to a turn based game would likely require<br>a lot of effort in changing c++ code whereas in Blitz if you knew <br>that you were going to make a turn based game you would likely <br>develop your code to suit that.  <br><br>As an analogy perhaps it could be seen that writing a game<br>in Blitz requires everything to be built from the ground up whereas<br>in Torque you start with a complete set of code and modify bits and pieces<br>of it to suit with the amount of modification required depending on the<br>complexity of these changes.  <br><br>It is much harder to "muck around" with Torque I find as if I want to test<br>something out in Blitz I can do a mock version of something quickly by<br>writing the code for the specific idea in mind.  Torque is better if you<br>have a firm idea of what you are making and are committed to the idea you<br>are trying to put into a game.  That is one of the reasons I have not made<br>anything with Torque - I cannot settle on an idea and so the thought of having<br>to make all kinds of engine changes / script modifications to achieve an idea<br>is too daunting whereas in Blitz starting a small mock project to test things can<br>be done quickly. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Torque is "programmed" by using a scripting language with strong similariites to C/C++. 99.9% of all game coding is through scripting. Scripts are simple text files that are compiled at run time. If you need additional functionality not provided by the engine, you can, if you're a licensed user, change the source code. (You get all the source when you buy and register). It can be compiled and run on OS X, PC and Linux platforms.<br>Torque has primarily been used as an FPS engine, but recently an add-on package for doing RPGs has been announced. There is also support for shaders currently in beta.<br>I own a TGE license and am currently programming a "space sim" FPS (ala Wing Commander). The engine is awesome but not without a few quirks.
