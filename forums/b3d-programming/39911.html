Games like EVE-Online and Freelancer create a "large" looking space by changing the field of vision (FOV) of the camera, then adjusting zoom to bring the player location back into the middle of the view. This makes things a long way away look much larger, space much more expansive, and reduces the "curving" of planets and such at the edge of the screen.<br><br>Unfortunately, Blitz3D has no FOV manipulation. No matter how big you make the "sphere" that your player is located inside, simply turning you can see the warping of space around you curving at the edges of the screen, giving space a very "small", "enclosed" look.<br><br>The best method I've discovered of giving space a "huge" look is to NOT have an external sphere at all. Instead, make space out of sprites. Yes.. Sprites! :P Have starfield/nebula/galaxy etc sprites. Lots of different designs as well. Not a single sprite for each star, but for say, 100 stars. And it pans out in the engine like this:<br><br> - Set a fairly distant drawview, say 2000.<br> - Position the sprites all around the 360 degrees of freedom at this distance. You'll probably want to write a "scene-editor" to help you do this, rather than always hard-coding in their positions.<br> - All sprites must be facing the camera initially, but in a fixed, upright position, not "free". You don't want them to turn to face the camera as you turn. <br> - Pivot all the "space" sprites to the camera, although retaining 0,0,0 orientation, rather than camera orientation.<br> - As your player moves and turns, move the XYZ location of the sprites with the player in relation to the GLOBAL position, so they always stay the same distance from the player, but as you turn, they don't. Do NOT rotate them.<br> - Voila! You have a large looking space scene. :)<br><br>The smaller the sprites you use, the better the effect, as they "wrap-around" less at the edges of the screen, however the more you have the higher the perfomance cost. A couple of hundred at most. Or write a routine which cycles through all the sprites each refresh (assuming you're storing them as a type) and hideentity any that aren't in the camera view, and showeentity any that are. You might be able to fit a couple of hundred more in that way.<br><br>----<br><br>Now - as for cloud-fields etc that you can fly through - again, its a matter of sprites, though handled differently. I've never seen a space game using volumetric fog for dust clouds.. they're all simply multiple layers of alpha-transparencied sprites that only come into view when within a certain distance from the camera. When further away, they hide all those sprites and use a single simple sprite to show the whole dust cloud. As you approach, this single sprite is faded out and the individual sprites which make up the dust could are faded in. This is how virtually all space engines (including Eve-Online) handle things like dust-clouds.<br><br>And flares.. sprites and a simple math system.<br><br>Asteroid fields/nebulae/mines.. as above with dust-clouds.<br><br>For the most part, in fact, a space system is all sprites and particles. Exhaust trails, planet rings, gun laser bolts, missile trails, explosions, suns - these are all generally sprites/particles. The only meshes you use in a space scene are the ships, and the planets.<br><br>+BlackD <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
