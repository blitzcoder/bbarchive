I was also unable to trace the UV bug (not that I expected to be able to find/fix it anyway), but its not that big a problem but it does reduce the overall effect. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

And it would probably slowdown any terrain Physics engines, cos it would need to extrapolate the missing verticies for collitions<br><br>I would see if you can get the effect/look that you wanted by useing TerrainDetail terrain,detail_level, and upping detail_level before I started messing with solid Mesh terrains)<br><br>(If you are going to try, I would look for all the points at a certain height, And make meshes of each group that is distinct. Of the top of my head I couldnt say the simplest way to do this) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
