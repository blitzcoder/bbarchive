</textarea><br><br>So far I have tested to playback mp3 and midi files. It supports playing a midi and mp3 simultaneously. Also afaiks the MP3 was not unpacked into memory as seems to be the case in Blitz3D, but the file was played from the disk.<br><br>Feel free to try and improve on the .decls file. (I haven't figured out how to get the status, position etc functions to work yet)<br><br>Installation:<br><br>copy saudio.decls to you userlibs folder under your Blitz3D installation.<br><br>copy andrewbc's saudio.dll to a folder that is in you system path. (or keep it in the same folder where your Blitz3D project is)<br><br>EDIT: There are some functions to record audio to, but i haven't mapped them, as I didn't have any need for them. Check out andrews .zip-file with the GameMaker code and I'm sure you'll see how to do it, if you need that.<br><br>EDIT: Fixed some status functions. Turns out they where string-pointers. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
