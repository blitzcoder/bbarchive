So... VRAM for screen, backbuffer and z-buffer. It goes like this (1024*768 screen as an example): <br><br>16-bit: <br><br>(1024[w] * 768[h] * 2[color bytes-per-pixel]) * 3[screen,back,z] = 4.72 megs <br><br>32-bit: <br><br>(1024[w] * 768[h] * 4[color bytes-per-pixel]) * 3[screen,back,z] = 9.44 megs <br><br>And you have other stuff there in the VRAM too, like vertexes, indexes and geometry which take variable amount of space. You should reserve some VRAM for those, maybe 5-10 megs... which means that using 1024*768*32 screen you have already used basically ALL the memory on the 16 meg 3D-card! <br><br>Here's how to calculate texture usage... let's use 512*512 sized texture as an example. <br><br>16-bit: <br><br>(512[w] * 512[h] * 2[color bytes-per-pixel]) * 1.33[mipmaps] = 0.697 megs. <br><br>32-bit: <br><br>(512[w] * 512[h] * 4[color bytes-per-pixel]) * 1.33[mipmaps] = 1.395 megs. <br><br><br><br>...And for those ppl who wonder why I (still) would like to get DXTC/S3TC, here's how much it saves texture memory... <br><br><br><br>-DXTC1 (color[16-bit], no alpha) 512*512 example would take this much: <br><br>(512[w] * 512[h] * 0.5[bytes-per-pixel]) * 1.33[mipmaps] = 0.174 megs. <br><br><br>-DXTC3 (color[16-bit] + alpha[4-bit]), 512*512 example would take this much: <br><br>(512[w] * 512[h] * 1[bytes-per-pixel]) * 1.33[mipmaps] = 0.349 megs. <br><br><br>...So if you compare this to the 16/32-bit unpacked textures you'll get either 4 or 8 times more texture using the same amount of VRAM. Pretty good savings, especially if you look at how much space the screens alone take, not to mention geometry etc. <br><br>DXTC/S3TC is NOT well suited for gradients, like skyboxes, and the alpha is coarse, so in the best case you should have an ability to use both packed and unpacked 16/32-bits mixed together (using flags or something). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Upping the screen resolution won't up the resolution of the sprites - except for ones that have been scaled down. At 640x480 everything looks fairly even, since the sprites were designed to look okay at this res. But at high res, different elements are different sharpnesses, depending on how much I've scaled them - some have minute detail and fine edges, while others, by comparison, look very blocky. It looks stupid. 640x480 is the only acceptable choice for having decent-sized sprites with a decent amount of animation, without burning ridiculous amounts of vidRAM.<br><br>It would be easy to allow support for all resolutions, but I am seriously considering capping it (or burying it in a command-line prompt), to stop people from automatically going, "Oh, higher res is better", and cranking it up, thus getting worse performance, and funny-looking graphics. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

However, I allow the user to choose his resolution anywhere between 640x480 and 1600x1200.  (Well, I do have one game that *insists* on 1024 - no more, no less - but that's the exception...)<br><br>Allowing user-specified res and doing 3D at that res, while doing 2D art at 1024, allows the player's 3D to look as clear as he wants it, while the 2D "bitmap overlay" stuff (like HUDs and consoles) is scaled to the screen resolution.  So, it looks kinda blocky below 1024, and especially at 640 due to downsampling (big surprise - *everything* looks blocky there, but at least it's supported and visible, if not crisp) and it looks no better than 1024 all the way up to 1600 (since it's just resampled to a higher res, but I *do* make it look good at 1024).  However, the 3D stuff matches the selected resolution as chosen, and that's what's important for framerate and most "in-game" clarity.<br><br>So, right now, I'm *aiming* my games at 1024x768, but I support from 640x480 to 1600x1200 (though rescaling of the 2D, though they're mostly 3D). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Vidcard memory concerns are exactly why I cap my 2D overlay stuff at 1024 instead of higher.  But, since higher 3D resolutions come "free" from programming/memory costs if the player has a good-enough vidcard, I certainly allow higher resolutions. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I agree that this compromises your download size, of course ( If you're selling that way ) but I find download size is much more dependent upon music than textures anyway.<br><br>Ultimately, very, very few commercial games don't support 640x480.
