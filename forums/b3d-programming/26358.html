DarkBasic Pro on the other hand does has many nice features and all if you can get them to work half the time...I've found that usaully when darkbasic pro posts an update to DBPro that it usaully fix's a few issues and then make other existing ones have bugs again...You normally have to wait untill the next update untill thoes bugs are corrected again.. And their BSP handling for DBPro is horrible!!! Their test demo is nothing more than a plan open room with nothing in it at all and it only gives a total frame rate of only 24 fps...That really isn't good at all if you want to make levels using BSP formats.. Lee Bamber did say in a email to me though that the BSP issue's are going to be dealt with in update 6 through 7 though! 3D GameStudio is also a very stable system as well..But it's based off of the language C though.. They do supply you with most of the development tools you need in order to create any type of game though, that is a nice setup on that part!! But Im' personaly comfortable using Blitz3D!

I also like the fact that Mark doesn't spend too much time telling us what's going on Because I belive he should spend all his time improving the Blitz languge.<br><br>Also one thing to consider is that Blitz does not yet support the latest computer 3D effects, if this is something you are looking for or think you will need.<br><br>Personally I don't think all the latest 3D effects are really that important unless you are making some kind of demo. For making a game you're going to be stressed enough coming up with nice looking characters, sounds, items, story, environments, and game design, that if you're really serious about making and compelting a game, the latest 3D effects will probably be last on your list of priorities.<br><br>But anyway just get your friend to download the demos and let him decide.

The language is fun and well thought out.<br><br>I can't get into Darkbasic Pro. I've tried but there is just too much wrong with it. So, I'll have to wait for a while, until the system isn't so full of bad suprises.<br><br>I absolutely love 3dGS. I think my biggest attraction to 3dGS is due to its extremely high level commands in a mid level language. Much more of a generic game is figured out for you to begin with. If you want to define it through a language you can work it out through c/c++ if you're so inclined. Or you can work it out through cscript or any language that can create a dll. You've got templates already included in 3dGS that do things like AI and animation states. CScript will allow you code the game from quasi mid level, to high level. IMHO CScript is as well thought out and structured as Blitz3d. But it also supplies many of the high high level commands that I would want from Blitz3d. Commands like the physics command set, the different shader commands (which are currently in beta) etc... You even have a publish button that will pack and encrypt your game and all of its resources for cd distribution.<br><br>3dGS definitely has it's drawbacks, but for my purposes it's pro's seriously outweigh its con's. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

For one thing, I think we are all mature adults here and I don't think this forum would become a vipers nest as you so put it!!

I have faith in Mark's abilities, and I also know that he's hard at work developing more updates to make Blitz3D and other Blitz related products more advanced and more exciting too!

Both 3D Game Studio and Dark Basic were sufficiently fragile that I would dismiss them just on that score.<br><br>Code readability: Blitz3D programs are far easier to read than DarkBasic and its demo projects are impressive and easy to follow. DarkBasic boasts of what you can do in 20 lines of code or whatever, but (a) try reading that code, and (b) DarkBasic sets up hidden defaults which essentially have to be turned off to write any real program, and so the reduced line count is an illusion.<br><br>3DGS is easy to use -- it's basically a drag and drop FPS construction kit. Too bad if you *don't* want to create an FPS, and if you do, why not just buy Unreal? It's more stable and comes with better tools and a better engine and is cheaper.

So is Blitz3d. There are differences in capability and ease of use. Preference between the two are best determined by individual work habbits versus product strength and weakness.<br><br>I think Mark Sibly put it best by saying that Blitz allows more control over what happens and 3dGS gives you less control.

I cant stress this enough.... Marketing will do wonders for you. Especially when you design a flashy editor that looks more like a game, and a great website that has lots of neat colors and features, and appears like it has lots of positive people backing it up. (dig deeper... things change). The version of darkbasic i had tested, had great highlevel language usage. meaning, the language set is simple. because of that, it gets sticky. if you wnt to do low level stuff you still have to use high level language set. Thats why everone complains about its syntax.<br><br>Torque game engine:<br>we bought this, and spent some time digging through it. We are probbably never going to use this on any significant project due to the fact that it can be modded to the hilt by end users. Its great creating a game, but if you create a game and have the end user change it, you really arent selling your game, your reselling a game engine. Its a great product, has some flaws with networking, but we like it overall. <br><br>And FInally Blitz basic.<br>Mark... i just want to take a moment to thank you for actually letting is know who you are. When people program in a language and get into it, usually they dont have a chance to know who is developing it, and they usually dont know if the person who supports the language cares. Mark actually reads this drivvel, and responds. Which is much more than i can say for other rad languages.<br><br>As for functionality. Id take blitz any day over darkbasic. Blitz seems to have a better mix of high/low level access to things. As well we have a superior community. Lots of people post code and chat in the forums. Thats the best part of this language is that people are willing to help when you have a problem. Its like free community support.<br>I do have some issues with collisions but i can always find workarounds, and i knw that Mark responds well to constructive critisizm of the language set, and has an open mind (thats not to say that every little idea or crazy notion gets accepted and incorporated into the language base).<br><br>Id have paid twice what i paid for blitz. And if/when mark comes out with BlitzMax 3d. Ill buy that... I'd pre order it. sight unseen. Just to support a language i know will be the thing lucidforge will use to compete with the industry giants.<br><br>There's my two cents...maybe more actually...lol<br><br>If there is any question in your mind, spend a month coding in blitz3d and darkbasic. if your any kind of programmer, you will appreciate blitz.<br><br>Good day <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
