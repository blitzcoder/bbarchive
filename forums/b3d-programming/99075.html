I'll try to be as intuitive as possible, but you'll have to read the following more than once until it makes sense.<br>It should take a while to explain.<br>Put on some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUsVl5r2NXc" target="_blank">lounge music</a>.<br>Deep breath.<br><br><br>Facts:<br><br>- Object A and B can have different speeds (even if in the end you give them both the same speed values).<br><br>- Object A is travelling by a fixed direction\angle of travel and speed. Object B is trying to intercept it with the shortest travel possible, with a fixed speed as well.<br><br>- Object A has a fixed direction\angle of travel and a starting position: from this we can abstract an infinite line which would be object A's path.<br><br>The thing is, depending on the position and speeds you assign to each of the two objects, object B might not reach the travelling object A at all.<br>If B is placed too far away and with a slower speed than that of A it'll never intercept it, as A will always be ahead.<br>In case A is not interceptable then you can return 'FALSE' or whatever, and tell the user object B will never intercept A.<br>So we need to first test for the interceptability of A; if it's interceptable by B then we proceed to compute the shortest path B has to travel in order for this to happen.<br><br>How do we test the interceptability of A? there are two ways; it depends on whether B is 'behind' or 'ahead' of A.<br>First of all, compute the shortest distance from B to A's path. This shortest distance is the smallest segment that goes from B and intersects with object A's path. This intersection is the point in A's path that's closest to B. <br><br>• If this point is behind A, then object B is behind A:<br><img src="http://i50.tinypic.com/64ja7t.png"><br><br>• If this point is ahead of A, then object B is ahead of A:<br><img src="http://i46.tinypic.com/261hq2u.png"><br><br>• If object B is behind A, we can test A's interceptability simply by comparing speeds: if object B is slower or as fast as A, object B will never reach A as A already has an advantage and will only "gain" on B.<br><br>• If object B is ahead of A, do this:<br>Calculate the time taken for B to travel its shortest distance to A's path.<br>Calculate the time taken for A to travel from its current point to the point in A's path that intersects B's shortest distance.<br>We are figuring out "who gets there first", at that yellow dot that is the point where B is closest to A's path:<br><img src="http://i49.tinypic.com/pc11k.png"><br>Under these conditions, if B arrives there first it means it CAN intercept A. If, however, A arrives at that point first, B will never be able to intercept it - this is because B is not capable of intercepting A even through the shortest route it could possibly take (which is the closest distance from B to A's path). If this is so, you can return that 'FALSE' and move on.<br><br>In case B arrives first (or at the same time as A): what matters is the time B takes to arrive there. If B arrives there faster (= takes less time), then we take this time advantage it has over A and use it to find the exact closest point of interception. <br>To do this, we take this time advantage B has and multiply it by B's speed (finding out how much distance B can walk along this time advantage). We add this distance we calculated to the shortest distance from A's path to B.<br>This will give us the specific distance object B needs to travel towards A's path in order to intercept object A.<br><br>• To find the actual point to travel to we need to abstract some things:<br><img src="http://i50.tinypic.com/2qv8eps.png"><br><br>• Using Pythagoras' theorem on that right-triangle:<br><img src="http://i50.tinypic.com/2nak6du.png"><br>This right triangle is comprised of...<br>- B's shortest distance to A's path;<br>- Interception distance (shortest distance from B + distance travelled by advantage time over A);<br>- An unknown distance which is the point of interception.<br><br>interceptDistance^2 = shortDistance^2 + unknown^2<br>unknown^2 = interceptDistance^2 - shortDistance^2<br>unknown = Sqr(interceptDistance^2 - shortDistance^2)<br><br>Once we have that unknown distance, we project from the point where B is closest to A's path, towards A, by that unknown distance. This is the interception point.<br>Aim object B at this point, make B and A start moving by their speeds and directions. They should eventually meet there.<br>Phew.<br><br>---------------------<br>I'll put this in code later on and see if it actually works (it did in my head at least). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
