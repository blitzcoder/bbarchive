It would work really very well for terrain I believe.<br><br>I suppose the memory could add up over time if you used over, say, 3 or 4 textures, but given they had a low resolution of about 128 to 256 they would only take up about 2.2mb per splat texture.  Of course, you could strip out those textures that are never used and cut down on it a bit.<br><br>In any case, I think that texture splatting could be very, very useful for terrain in Blitz3D.  Come tomorrow I'll be attempting to write up a pseudo-terrain system that utilizes it.  If I make any progress I'll open-source it.<br><br>If anyone else would like to have a go at it, this is the reference I'll be using (as far as I'm concerned it's the best): <a href="http://www.cbloom.com/3d/techdocs/splatting.txt" target="_blank">http://www.cbloom.com/3d/techdocs/splatting.txt</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In the case of vertex alpha, there'd be a very (and I mean very) noticeable seam in the texture blending.<br><br>Ultimately, texture splatting would probably end up being more efficient (my former idea of textures using 2.2mb per splat was incorrect) in the long run due to it not having the disadvantages that vertex alpha-blended terrain present with (distance-based, typically) LOD.<br><br>Either way, it's a preference thing.

It's possible to use a 3rd uv +mask layer to define the mask, and then you (Well vivid)multply's texture 1 by the pixel color of the mask texture, inverses the luminance, then multiplys that by the second texture...Then add the results together, and multiply by your ambient level..and bada bing. Perfect seemly texture transistions.<br><br>It works beautifully, and barely affects the frame-rate.<br><br>And cos your limiting each texture by a color alpha map you can also overlay a 3rd texture in this..A control texture.<br>Literally making it possible to write ANTONY in white letters, save this as the mask, combine this with the terrains rock and snow texture..run, to be greeted by ANTONY wrote in snow, the rest in rock...<br><br>Rambling again, but anyway, if you can get it running b3d noel, I'd go for it.

That demo blends a path texture with a grass texture using an alpha map. With Blitz's texturing I think blending 2 textures together like that is the limit because if you load in another texture and another alpha map for it it overwrites the other textures you had. <br><br>In that link you posted he seemed to be using methods not available to blitz in terms of manipulating textures. He seems to have 1 alpha texture for each texture used on a terrain tile stretched across the tile, which is ok for him because he has the means to use multiple alpha maps per surface for each texture. Unfortunately I don't think this is possible in blitz. I'd love for someone to prove me wrong though because it'd be damn useful! :)<br><br>Theres no reason why there would be seams between tiles for a tiled terrain using vertex alpha though. Theres just the overhead problem of all the extra tris. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
