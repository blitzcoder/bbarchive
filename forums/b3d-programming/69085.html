They can spend points to create replicant troops which automatically try to advance and take enemy territories. This game mode is similar to one in a somewhat obscure title from 1998, Future Cop. It was full 3D and the player was able to create up to 40 units at a time, I believe, though the units you could create were basically unanimated, compared with the walker the player controlled.<br><br>So, say I want to do this with animated humanoid models. They don't really need to be that detailed...only as much as the average RTS (think between Warcraft 3 and C&amp;C 3). But, from what I understand...this is STILL way to much to handle with B3D format, as the bone animation multiplies your slowdown exponentially with each additional animated entity...<br><br>So, this leaves three animated formats, MD2, 3DS, and X. I would like to rule out MD2 altogether to begin with...the lighting support is atrocious. I know very little of how animated 3DS and X files work in Blitz...and have no clue if they would be able to do what I need.<br><br>I suppose I could create the field commander as a B3D mesh, for better detail, and have the mass production units use one of the other formats, so they wouldn't totally kill the framerate. Anyone have an opinion on the best way to go about this, or is there just no way to realistically manage up to 100 animated low-poly troops at once using Blitz3D? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Was a great game though.<br><br>Personally I use B3D for everything. I would suggest just doing a few tests, 40 animated meshes doesn't sound too much to me, but then it depends what else is going on. Just try it and see, its easy enough to swap out models formats afterwards if the frame rate is pants. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Md2s will increase that number to around 25-50 depending on their polycount.  However my laptop will probably not play any games released in the last 6 months - although I've not tried many on it, it will however play Doom3 and Dawn of War at an acceptable frame rate on low/medium settings.<br><br>I've never seen an animated 3ds model and know little about getting x models in animated format into b3d as x files <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Oh well, this was really a hypothetical question for a project I plan to do in the near future. I may have to just go with another engine when I reach that point, as much as I hate to...unless 3DS/X can work for my needs.<br><br>Anyway, thanks for trying guys.
