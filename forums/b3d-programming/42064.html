Something that kinda works like Visual Basic.  Just double click the Actor, Prop, or whatever and it breaks out a script editor.  But the scripts will be broke down into Events that happen on the object itself.<br><br>Example:<br>Event Actor_(Name)_Move()<br>   ;Scripting<br>End Event<br><br>Event Actor_(Name)_Collision()<br>   ;scripting<br>End Event<br><br>So when an actor moves, it'll check to see if a script bank doesn't have a value of zero.  If so, then it'll run the script stored in it.<br><br>Though i thought of many things for opitimizing the process, i'm sure it'll still, over all, add at least add a good amount of millsecs to the loop.  <br><br>Now, i've been thinking, instead, just to load objects in the map editor.  And they have Handles, as many as the editor wants to create.  So u can have groups and such.  <br><br>Object in group: "Second Wave", ID:2 ; "Primary Targent for Second Event", ID:0 <br><br>Then, blitz3d itself, u make the "scripts" by creating custom functions for produce whatever checks and events u want.  So example.  Say u had an Object and Wave 1.  U want want an Event to happen once all objects in Wave 1 have been destoryed.  U'll have custom, per level, functions that check for these things.  So u can make a quick loop to check for all the objects in Wave 1 and see if all their life values = 0.  if so, then it'll start up the next event.<br><br>The problem with that is, once, u aren't coding in the editor so much. Problem two, i'll have to compile the whole project over and over again.<br><br>The Plus sides are the speed gain, direct access to the objects properties and easy creation of your own types u want for that particular level.<br><br>With the interpurted language, i can just have a quick "compiler" and just port it straight into the engine.  No recompiles of .EXEs and such.<br><br>So i'm just tryin to figure out the best way to handle the job.  Any ideas are welcome.  Thank you for reading. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Im over $300US with all these add on and what not.  LOL<br><br>Anyway, Iv been saying for a while the solution is something a bit more capable like LUA as a scripting language, but the callback issue seems to be the road block on that.   LUA is probably one of the best scripting languages in the world, especialy for working with games and other typicaly graphic orianted applications.<br><br>I see that BMX looks like it will be getting a LUA module soon, or at the very least access to the LUA dll, so I'll probably be upgrading to that as soon as PC version is released.<br><br>BVM looks sweet, but don't see paying money to code in Blitz( Im not saying BVM is not worth $15, or $50 to some, just not to me.).  If I want to open up my game subsystems, a simple DLL interface and wrapper for a more powerfull scripting language should be all that is needed.<br><br>Again, I am not saying BVM is not good, or a valuable asset to the Blitz tool set, I am just saying I don't want to use Blitz in my projects as a scripting language when, IMHO, the goal of a scripting language should be to allow for more efficiant use of systems not accessable from within Blitz. I just don't see the benifit of locking people into the same limitations with the scripting language as with Blitz.   Examples would be, being able to better access sound subsystems and devices, many of which you can not do very well in Blitz.  Using a better language for scripting while requiring a little more work on the part of the developers( having to learn the scripting language too ) just opens so many more doors.<br><br>So, I am looking at creating a wrapper for a alternitive Scripting Language.  I know LUA, PERL and PYTHON can all be compiled into .dll.  However, LUA looks like it uses call backs, that I do not think can be done with Blitz's userlib interface, so Im probably going to try PYTHON.  Really any Runtime Interpreter or byte code compiled langauge should be usable.  Hmm, wonder if I could make a native interface from JAVA? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Can you write your own command set in BVM which runs functions rather than using the Blitz commands?<br><br>3. I don't expect this, BUT.. can a BVM script run another DLL that wasn't compiled as part of the original program? For instance, say I want to add usage of FREEIMAGE.DLL on in an add-on script I'm writing, can I call that via the script and it'll run as normal? :) It's okay if you say no - I don't know any other scripting languages that can do that except Source.

So the set of commands you provide to the script is entirely open and up to you.<br><br>What I was really talking about are some extensions I'm making to the core BlitzBasic language to make it more powerfull. Like OOP (much like in BlitzMax), function pointers etc.<br><br>2) I guess point (1) answers that. Yes you can expose any function to your scripts, and actually you can as easily expose types and global variables<br><br>3) You mean use in a script a DLL that was not in advance linked to the main program?<br>Then the answer is yes and no. No, you cannot in this case call the DLL function directly, but you can still use <a href="/b3ddocs/command.php?name=CallDLL&amp;ref=goto" target="_blank">CallDLL</a>, provided you exposed CallDLL to your script in the first place (as well as PokeInt &amp; co, which are needed to use CallDll). Note though that CallDLL works only with DLLs specifically written for Blitz using a special convention.<br><br>Now, if the DLL usage had been planned from the beginning then for sure it's even easier: just compile your main program in such a way that it can access a DLL (this simply means having the right ".decls" file), then list the DLL commands in the command set file (very much like in the .decls file) and voila. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
