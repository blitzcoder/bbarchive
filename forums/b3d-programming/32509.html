It's no secret shattered and myself are developping a truely amazing engine that I guarantee will leave you stumped once it's released, but the reason it's not well known is because we aren't willing to release any material yet until we launch our techdemo. I did download an mpeg and I keep a close eye on ROAM and SOAR style terrain development, because I'm sure that in time, just like with many other terrain techniques a new technological advancement will make them standard again, for now I'm sticking with a hybrid technique for up close and detailed terain.

Another time for larger scenes is when turning around past a certain point. <br>Also when one is walking in the real world, you don't notice distant objects as much because you are so busy watching your steps, <br>so you don't trip on something. But when you stop to take in the scenery, then distance matters. <br>And after having stopped for a while, the distance view could be projected as a horizon on a sky box, <br>so it's still there after you start moving. So rendering in the distance would only be done periodically.<br>On the other side: While walking through a forest, a closeup detailed scene is best. <br>Also, while in the woods one doesn't expect a fast frame rate either. Running in the woods isn't a good idea. <br>So maybe the ability to dynamically choose between 3x3 or something farther. <br> <br>I have tried this approach with Blitz's terrain function, and the distance view fills in almost instantly. <br>I used 1500 units of distance while walkiing and when I stopped for 2 secs, I had it do 300,000 units. <br>I never started the skybox idea, because I decided the Terrain function was to limited, because of a lack of texturing ability. <br>If there was a way to tile a blitz terrain of any size, with different texture tiles, my problems would be over.<br><br>These were just ideas for your consideration, for the Storm Terrain Engine. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
