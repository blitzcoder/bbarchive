Either they're separate animations, or strafe is done by turning the character's torso in the run animation.<br><br>Incidentally, creating an animation sequence for every combination isn't just a lot of work, it is impossible.  There is no way to know at what point in the character's run cycle the weapon swing begins.

Animation masking is functionally identical to having the model split into two parts which are animated separately.

You just need to be a little extra cautious, that's all.<br><br>For instance, let's say the bones of the lower body are children of the pelvis bone.  The pelvis will probably be a child of the root node, which never moves at all.  The upper body may then also be a child of the pelvis.  You need to be sure that your upper body animations don't rely on specific rotations of the pelvis, since the pelvis should be controlled by the lower body animations.  As the pelvis rises and falls, due to the walking motion, so will the upper body.  The trouble is, you will want for the pelvis to be able to twist slightly with the walking motion--and this will cause the whole of the upper body to rotate with it...  <br><br>So here's what I suggest, to fix that problem:  For the upper body, make a lower-back bone as a child of the pelvis, with the rest of the upper body being a child of that lower-back bone.  After applying upper and lower body animations, always set the Y-rotation (if not all three axes) of the lower-back to 0 (or to their initial rotations).  That should allow the lower body to twist naturally, while the upper body doesn't mechanically twist with it.  And since you're using a smooth mesh, with weighted vertices, that twisting action should be smoothly applied between upper and lower body.<br><br>Hope this helps! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Second I created a multidimensional array for each bone in the character. Before the main loop is reached I have a routine to play all of the animations through and captured the rotations of each bone at each frame into the arrays. Finally I have another function or functions that sets the bones’ orientations of the model in the scene, usually the legs and hips take the rotations from one animation whilst the upper body takes the rotations from another animation.<br><br>Make sure you use the right global options for reading and setting bones' orientations as I ran into many weird errors early on because I was using the wrong ones or mixtures! It should actually be relative to their parent rotations not an absolute rotation. A silly but easy mistake to make.<br><br>Sorry if this wasn't very clear, I'd post my code but it's very kludgy and I really ought to have rewritten it myself. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

What you're doing is creating a duplicate of data that the Blitz engine stores internally.  If you load your animated model (just once) and then create a hidden copy of it, you have a reference that gives you the exact same information, without using up additional memory resources.  Simply set the hidden copy to whatever frame you want to refer to, and then have a look at the bone rotations.  Which also means you can refer to frame 134.678 (an interpolation between two frames) ...which you couldn't do with your array of data.  If you use a locked frame rate then that's not an issue for you, but if you use delta timing, then that certainly would be an issue.<br><br><div class="quote"> It should actually be relative to their parent rotations not an absolute rotation. <br></div><br>This is the kind of difficulty I was referring to.  You do need to be careful when mixing animations like this, because rotations are relative to their parent, and their parent's parent, etc.  So by organising the upper body and lower body as I've described, you can get round this problem. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
