I was wondering if DX7,8 and 9 processes can run parallely on the same machine. While two DX7 processes can run without any problems, DX8 used to write into the texture of a running DX7 EXE. A simple test: a windowed blitz3d app with a spinning textured cube. Then DXDIAG.EXE is started and a Direct3D test is performed. After the DX8 test, the texture in the blitz window is altered (without to crash the blitz app).<br><br>Now, what's so special about that? If a DX8 app can write to the texture buffer of a blitz app, then in theory the blitz app may also write to the texture of a DX8 app. Now, how about some shaders that are perfomed by DX8 on a texture buffer that Blitz3D has access to? And if DX8 can do it, maybe DX9 too.<br><br>Not sure if this is possible on an OS with Ram protection and User prvilegs, such as XP and later. Any cpp cracks around? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That's why fullscreen is usually faster than windowed mode.<br><br>Also, this will very likely cause memory leaks - imagine releasing a texture on B3D and not on the 'external program'; memory will be splitted by the two programs (at least memory for backbuffer, which is reserved on initializing DX)... too many problems, for too little gain: you also won't be able to run all shaders, shaders will be slower since there are other DX instances running, etc.<br><br>An no, DX7 "texture buffers' (more like DDSURFACE) isn't the same as DX8 - completly different data structures. You would have to pass some pointer to the actual data on DX7, create a new texture on DX8, copy it to this new texture, do whatever you want, and then transfer it back again to that pointer area.

Sounds good. I tried the Freebasic Wrapper for Irrlicht. At the time I tried it, it supported only OGL, but for some reason I'd like to continue with DX. I've also seen a DX-Irrlicht wrapper for Purebasic, but Purebasic is not giving free updates and the version I purchased some time ago doesn't support the wrapper (and I won't buy lots of updates).<br><br>Depending on my current situation I would spend some money for something like that, as long as purchasing is easy, eg. with Paypal.<br><br>When I tried Irrlicht, I noticed the stencil shadows were rather slow, a small BSP map with 1 NPC with 2 lights and shadows made the rate go down to 15 or so. It seemed to me it didn't make use of hardware stencils, but this could be caused by OGL 1.1 that is installed in windows (xp?) by default and does use software solutions for most of its capabilities, AFAIK.<br><br>When I am reflecting this issue honestly then I must confess it isn't so much the need for an other engine, but rather my addiction to search for a thing that I haven't got and that promises to solve some things, eg. speed problems with shadows and with missing features. But in fact plain vanilla Blitz3D is still extremly powerful and there are only a few things that I cannot do with it. The term "live after Blitz" was implying that Blitz3D is dead, but that's definitely not true. Even with the lack of shaders it is still one of the best choices IMHO.<br><br>So when you can manage to wrap the entire Command set to Irrlicht and hold the stability that B3D has, then this would be a great product in my opinion.<br><br>SLotman  - That's for BMax, isn't it? Not sure if I want to change from Blitz3D to BMax. I know it's a good compiler, but I also heared some people found it a bit hard to learn - and I am somebody who doesn't have the nerves even for cpp . BTW. somewhere I used to read Max3D became open source, is that true? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
