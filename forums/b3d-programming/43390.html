One (wasteful, where shared instruments are concerned) solution is to use multiple mods but, as you'll know, you can't hold mods in waiting in RAM for instantaneous initiation in Blitz; instead you tend to get a pause as the file is loaded in fresh. However it has been suggested that loading all the modules you'll need before starting a level can ensure they're in the cache and thus minimise this glitch - might be a compromise, but it's worth a look at least. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I guess the system would just need to be able to queue up a song ahead of time and play it immediately when the currently playing song ends.  If the songs are something like one measure each, you could vary the score enough (on a nice beginning-of-the-measure boundary) to match the game mood as it changes.<br><br>If you record your songs into loops (little WAV files for a measure or two or four each, that seamlessly fit to the next section), you could actually play them simultaneously during a change in mood and cross-fade them by volume change.<br><br>Just some random thoughts... hope it sparks something for you.<br><br>Ed <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
