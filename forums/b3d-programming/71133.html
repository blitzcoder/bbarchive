I could probably re-create the code but I'm lazy and its easier to ask a question here.<br><br>The original:<br>The code originally posted had an animated circle on the screen which moved in a smooth lazy elipse. This app also worked as a "server" accepting incomming connections.  There was also a "client" app that would connect to the server.  The behaviour this pair of simple programs demonstrated was that when the client connected to the server the animation paused noticably while the client's connection was dealt with.<br><br>The upshot of this was while it wouldnt matter at all for low volume online game which waits for everyone to connect before starting the session it would not be good for an application which allows clients to come and go as they please.  This would of course be because if a group of users decided to all connect at once it would tie up the server for a number of seconds and produce a serverwide "lag spike" for everyone already connected.<br><br>Now to my question:  Is this still the case?  (meanwhile I shall fire up B3D and see if I can reproduce the effect) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The server has been running for over 3 weeks straight now.  I randomly send it insane packets from multiple external IP's.  The server is on a 12meg connection mind you, but its surprisingly stable.  I am using UDP however, I do not believe protocol has anything to do with blitz's ability to maintain connections.  Believe it or not ive had better response with stability with blitz than I have with C# and .NET's winsocks.  I do have one compliant running a blitz server though.  The window will after sometime go completely black.  I have a console setup to remedy this, so in order to view whats going on, I have to make another call back to graphics x,x,x,x to get the damned window to render... this spikes the server and causes about a 500ms latency with incoming and outgoing messages.  One other thing is an issue with blitz windows not rendering under a remote desktop session as they require specific graphics modes to be set on the machine.  So expect huge latency when trying to remote in to manage the machine.  Also you may want to not how much CPU usage Blitz takes up while running.  Put this on a dedicated machine, and dont expect to run TOO many other services on it.  I have Blitz, MYSQL,and  Apache running on a dual 3.8 xeon with 4gb of ram, and it only has about 70% processing power left to handle server side functions.  Other than that, there is no reason why you cannot use blitz to run dedicated server code. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
