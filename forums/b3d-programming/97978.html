(no terrain) I am thinking something along the lines of some kind of grid system where I save a list of entities to create when you enter the region? I'm just not sure how to approach this problem and was wondering if I could get some advice from anyone who has experience with this sort of thing. Thanks!<br><br>P.S. By "massive" I mean that certain parts are so far away that rendering them would be trivial and a waste of render time.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

A kind of skybox (i call it FarAwayThingsBox) but with only the parts of the terrains, of the buildings, shown, the others parts of the image is black in order to be able to use the mask (4).<br><br>You can also create zones with irregular shapes if you use "portals" or connections between some zones, you can then determine in which zone a player or a npc is, and therefore hide and show the appropriate zones.<br><br>I add some precisions for those who are interested about this :<br>It is easy to know in which zone the Player or a npc is, because they can only enter or exit a zone by going through specific portals.<br>With this data, you know in which zone the player is, you know what are the portals of this zone, and you also know to what others portal of others zones the portal of this zone are connected, and thus you know what is the active zone, and what are the zones connected to this zone. You can then display them accordingly.<br><br>One more thing : if you want to create a streaming engine (like Morrowind or Boiling Point) it seems most of the meshes are preloaded in the ram, only the meshes of the buildings and of the terrains are loaded in streaming. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It uses an array to store tile information, a bit like a 2d tilemap. Each quad has a texture assigned, from a larger composite texture, essentially giving you a single surface system. Each mesh (like house or building) is stored in a layer of this array, and only drawn when in range/view. This is a top down view (isometric) and isn't really designed for fps view etc.<br><br>I have a floating quad mesh which just covers the viewable screen area, and scrolls/updates with the array data. It seems to be quite efficent. One thing I did learn however. Never use the blitz alpha flag for texture blending. It still doesn't work on alot of system. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
