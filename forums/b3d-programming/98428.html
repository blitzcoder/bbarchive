(like start again difficult)<br><br>My own 2 cents:<br>I reckon that was the idea behind MAX &amp; Monkey, languages with no specific engine, which is a -much- better design (as opposed to a totally -unique-  compilable script-like language and inseparable engine). It is a shame Max3D never got finished but there are loads of Max compatible B3D like engines out there (Leadwerks, Xors, MiniB3D), so you -do- have your new B3D. You can even use Max like b3d structure wise if you want to (eg. non strict and procedurally). <br><br>There are many people who do not want to learn max because they know the b3d command set and hate the idea of re-learning, but it is a command set built around DX7, anything else would require a quite different command set, and would very unlikely be "load and go" compatible with old code anyway, and would probably require l lot of re-learning too. <br><br>Besides, why would you want to use a unique-script DX only engine in this day and age (Especially DX9)?? What with ms &amp;  windows being all over the place at the moment as well.<br>-OpenGL, AL &amp; X-platform baby ftw!<br><br>Personally I would like to have seen Max3D finished, as that combined with MAX's language power would be totally a B3D-Mk 2. Of course you could not call it that because everyone would think it would be backwards compatible which of course would be virtually impossible without a load of legacy wrappers.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
