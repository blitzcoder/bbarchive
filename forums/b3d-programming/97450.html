I added a bunch of resolutions to the game I'm working on and noticed one wasn't showing up on the selection screen.  Resolutions that your computer can show are the only ones that show up.  1440x900 isn't showing up.  Running a short program, I CAN get a window at 1440x900.  <br><br>I wrote a bit of code to check for the gfx mode, which it does and returns, at least on my PC, 0 for mode does not exist (1 is mode exists).  It waits for a key and then in the second part of the program, sets the graphics mode to 1440x900 and draws a line in red around the border.  Taking a screen shot of this, I verified this rectangle as being 1440x900.  <br><br>Am I missing something here?  Has anyone else had this problem?<br>I am wanting to include this mode as some laptops and some 19" monitors use this mode.  Is it safe to assume someone with a 1440x900 setup would be able to run 1366x768, 1360x768, or 1280x720?  <br><br>Here's the code, could someone else run it and see what result they get?<br><br>Ian<br><br><pre class=code>Print GfxMode3DExists(1440, 900, 32)

When I change the line to Graphics3D 1440,900,32,1, it says "Unable to set graphics mode".  <br>Doing Graphics3D 1440,900,32,2 I get the window in the right size.<br>Graphics3D 1440,900,32,3 I don't get past the first result, when I hit a key, the box stays the same size and no graphics appear.<br>So I'm only getting the res in a window.  I think debug defaults to windowed.<br><br>The main issue is screen edges and the cursor appearing in the right spot.  To debug that I have to double check the placement and can't if I can't set the mode on mine :(  I'm thinking of cutting this mode rather than doing it wrong.  <br><br><br>@Yasha The road to Hell is paved with assumptions, no?!  <br><br>Thanks for testing it on yours! :)<br><br>I've looked into taking the desktop and using that as the default.  No easy command to do that in Blitz3D.  Right now I am going through modes, picking the best (biggest) widescreen mode.  If all of those fail, it picks 4:3 modes.  The lowest is 800x600 which should run on a Flintstones computer.  Once you get in-game, there is an option to set the resolution to whatever you want.  <br><br>I'm just wondering if 1440x900 monitors/desktops have 1366x768 modes too, as those seem to be the most popular with the most popular laptops these days, the 15.6" ones?  If someone had native 1440x900, the game could just go to 1366x768 or 1280x800 or whatever, and it would be transparent to the user? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
