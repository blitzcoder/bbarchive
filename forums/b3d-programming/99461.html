I am near finished with the map-editor and now am working on creating an engine that can run all of the things that is needed in the game mainly events such as "doors, levers, boxes, area triggers Ect. anywho in this process i was working on doors. i have it set up like this, in the map editor you place a "door", each door has a corresponding "pointer" all this pointer does is show where you will be placed if you walk through that door and what angle you will be looking.<br><br>i figured i would just free entitys if they did not belong in the "area" and just delete the types. then i got thinking about walking around in the open part of the world (city to city) should i divide the land into seperate "areas" and as you walk it loads in the areas closeish to you and just makes all items "hidden" till you get closer  and dissapear as you walk away and then delete if you get even farther away? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You want to check how much RAM the components of a zone take when they are loaded, and decide to load all components of a zone at the same time (when loading a zone), or load/delete components depending on the Camera position and orientation.<br><br>Concerning the display of others zones, what i would do is create a flipped box or a flipped cylinder around the active zone and have a texture that represents the components of the others zones around the active zone.<br><br>Loading the components of a zone progressively can be complicated, i prefer to use doors/portals to choose which zone to load and which zone to delete.<br><br>After that, managing the movement of a character (npc) from one zone to another zone and the saving of its position, orientation is a new challenge.<br>Instead of trying to save all components of a zone (static and moving) in the same file, it may be a better approach to save only the static components of zone in a file and the moving components temporarily in this zone in another file.

</textarea><br><br>This example uses tables and chairs to demonstrate - where each table will have a collection of chairs that belong just to it and you can list and do stuff to each of these chairs without ever touching the chairs belonging to another table.<br><br>For proper use you'd create function to handle the type stuff thats used over and over again, this is especially useful for UIs implemented in B3D as you can handle the controls within a window without having to iterate through every instance of a control and check if its connected to the window your dealing with (which is a massive performance hog). More specific to this thread you can use a zoning system to group objects within a zone and only ever process the ones relevant to the current zone(s).<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
