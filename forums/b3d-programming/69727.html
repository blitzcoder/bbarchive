Sorry I feel like Im flooding the boards here.  My MMORPG is really starting to come along.  A mock inventory system is in the works and everything else seems to be going great.  However; I have a serious issue with the combat system.  My brain apparently just cannot fathom the equations.  Ive ported many over to bb such as Guild Wars and Diablo 2's.  I have the equations expression for expression and it never seems to act consistently.  As you may know having a balanced and 100% accurate combat system is a must for this type of game.  Enough ranting.  Does anyone feel like helping me code a base combat system to build upon later?  Or does anyone know of any Expressions/equations that take into account a lot of modifiers?<br><br>Any help would be appreciated. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Of which I have neither when it comes to making arbitrary values for modifiers and then making sense out of it.  I can just come up with some random numbers and sure it may work, but it needs to be balanced.  Ala I dont want some player to have just the right ammount of Strength and just the right weapon attributes to break the equation.  I guess what im asking is why do most rpgs use the same(or similar in nature) values for items and modifiers and get the same results.  Why does this value effect that one etc.  There is just so much to it that coming up with an entire system is proving difficult.  Id much rather continue the work ive been making on the server end of things rather that this combat carp haha. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Most RPG's use similar systems because that's what works, and in my opinion, because they're lacking imagination. You're right though, the guts of the program are absolutely vital to the success of the game, and if you don't get this part right, the rest will fail. As an example, I'm currently working on a football (Soccer) game. It's absolutely crucial that the match itself works correctly and uses the player's skills to generate a convincing result - otherwise the rest of the game will fail regardless.<br><br>Unfortunately I don't think we can help too much because the problem is too broad. What sort of numbers are you using for your characters and items? If it's very similar to an existing game such as D&amp;D or WoW then you could probably just try to mimic their results. Personally I'd go for a whole new system, but that would be ambitious. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

As Leto says, this is a very complex subject - depending on how complex your game is I suppose. When you look at how a game such as WoW works, the chance of a hit are based on dozens of factors - and even then I think it's still a bit too simple. You've got strength + skill with weapon + agility + class + other stuff vs the opponents armour + agility + dodge skill etc etc. It really is specific to your game and will require lots of testing to get it right. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
