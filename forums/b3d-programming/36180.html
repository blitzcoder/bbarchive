I've come up with a crazy model train puzzle game. The conceptual part is already complete (and it seems very good) and I may talk about it later. For now I'll just say that it is very deep and I can see how to do it. <br><br>Now, the first thing that came to my mind is physics. The game is going to be built in a way that tracks can go very high and in crazily loopy trails, but also with a nice physics engine so that trains derail and move properly (and bridges can break in a nice way). So, do you know how to create good train physics using tokamak physics, newton physics, or your own code? I can see with tokamak that the wheel would be a convex hull, but I don't know exactly how well it would react to a train, and if it would derail properly or not.<br><br><br><br><br><br>PS: Oh, I had the adams family in mind for a special mode when I created this :D <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The puzzles are normally to make a train line that can get cargo from one place to another for a while according to certain time limitations, cargo carrying limits, etc. There may also be many trains at once, probably crossing over the same main line, in which case you would have to get perfect timing to make it work right.<br><br>The part I'm confused about for the physics isn't connecting the wagons, but the wheels and engine. How can I get the engine to move using its wheels or some faked method? And then how can I get the wagons to have wheels that hold onto the track sufficiently? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

MEGAbullet Trainz et. al.<br><br>OK keeping in mind that I am a noob that you have helped.<br><br>you are going to need some sort of physics engine to handle gravity + momentum<br><br>What about maglev. The rail is like a T and the train could have a bottom like a C to hold the T (you know curl under it and stuff) that way when it went upside down... like in a loop it would hold on and you wouldn't need wheels. <br><br>as far as making it go... I have no idea. what makes the game ace cars go is usually +/- Y (I think its Y I haven't looked at my FPS code in a month while I spend time learning arrays!) and usually mousesteering to get the rotation so the object is always pointing straight... if you just had speed and no steering but let the track do the steering then???<br><br>You could have little alpha0 entitys and tell the train to steer for the next closest entity once it reaches an entity... <br><br>Lame suggestion but I am trying to think about how the designers of race car games get the drivers in the other cars to stay on the track.<br><br>Didn't someone ask about that (Race Cars) a little while ago???<br><br>-Rook <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Here's a hint, the decision was affected by the maglev suggestion. I am not going to have a physics object wheel, it will just be an impulse holding the train up and pushing it from many places to simulate a wheel.<br><br>I'm still gonna try other stuff though, because that above idea is bound to screw up.<br><br>By the way, don't you love it when you can trick the player into doing the thinking for the computer so you don't have to code it?
