End Function</pre>This example may seem trivial (why not just use a field for each pet type - emu.emu and ferret.ferret) but consider this:<br><br>The problem with designing a linked list which manages objects of type foo is that you'll be hard-coding all your functions to deal with type foo.  If you wind up needing a second linked list for objects of type bar later on, (or worse, a second linked list of objects of type foo!) you'd need to copy all your functions.  Handle() to the rescue!  If you write all your linked list code to manage a list of integers instead of type objects, then you can store Handles in there and turn them back into Objects when you retrieve the values.<br><br>This example uses my <a href="/codearcs.php?code=1438" target="_blank">double linked list library</a>.<br><br><pre class=code>include "listType.bb"

; create some objects
type fooType
	field value$
end type
x.fooType = new fooType : x\value$ = "bar"
y.fooType = new fooType : y\value$ = "baaz"
z.fooType = new fooType : z\value$ = "quux"

; push them into a new list
list.listType = new listType
list_push(list, handle(x))
list_push(list, handle(y))
list_push(list, handle(z))

; iterate over our list
list_iterator_begin(list)
while list_iterator_next(list)
	this_element.fooType = object.fooType(list_iterator_get(list))
	print this_element\value$
wend</pre>You use Handle() when you put things into the list, and Object() when you take them out.  The linked list only has to worry about integers, and you get to store whatever you want in there.  The only drawback is that it's up to you to make sure that you don't mix types. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

When I heard about Object() I thought it returned an object of the type held in Handle(), but in reality you have to declare the type of Object(). So storing cats, dogs and ferrets, you need object.cat(), object.dog() and object.ferret() to read them, and you need ot know what type you've written to which Handle() index. If I write<br><br>a=Handle(pussy.cat)<br>b=Handle(puppy.dog)<br>c=Handle(mink.ferret)<br><br>I need to call Object.cat(a) but Object.dog(b), instead of Object(a) and Object(b) and get a type returned of whatever type a and b are. That would make Object() a very useful function, but as you need to declare its type it's no different really to using custom objects for selecting from list/arrays of objects.<br><br>Anyhow, thanks octothorpe for the insight. Looking at you linked list I realised it's using type fields to store the pointers.

You can assign IDs in variety of ways. I use a FIFO stack push/pop IDs. This is good for recycling IDs with objects that are created and delete constantly. I could sort the objects by ID without interupting the structure of the collection.<br><br>External Control comes in handy as well. For example in an AI Editor I create 'Trigger {ID:1}' to activate 'Door {ID:33}'. Because I know the ID of these objects before hand its easy to tell the game engine what its suppose to do with them. Additionally, I can access the properties of the object like so:<br><pre class=code>objID(myself%)\value$="Greetings World"
Print objID(myself%)\value$

;You cannot do 
Object.obj(myself%)\value$="Greetings World"
Print Object.obj(myself%)\value$</pre>It is true that some additional code is required. Its true that some additional memory is required, but, for the level of control its worth it IMHO. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Simply calling Handle() on something doesn't add it to a container.<br><br>Take a look at my linked list library and you'll see that it's managing the Handles in a perfectly normal linked list.  I could easily write a stack-managed vector identical to your object management system (yes, with separate, assignable IDs!) which would manage Handles instead of objects - the difference would be that I wouldn't need to copy code every time I wanted a new container, and I could pass my containers to functions, and even store them in other objects.  I'd also have a miniscule performance reduction for Blitz's Object/Handle overhead.<br><br>The container type you're advertising is great and everything, and I'm glad it's served you so well, but it's not ideal for all purposes; if it were, the other container classes wouldn't exist.  IDs are great too, but linked lists don't use IDs.  If Shifty Geezer says he wants a linked list, assume that he does. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
