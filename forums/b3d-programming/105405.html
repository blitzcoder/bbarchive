(I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one here having a graveyard full of hard drive, graphics card, memory stick ... just because there is always a moment you need to step up and try by yourself some impredictible stuff)<br><br>My only advice : help yourself and buy a low-cost machine dedicated with low-cost material (like a 50$/100$ PC from ebay with old graphics chipset, old cpu and probably some DDr2 ram), trust me, it totally worth it, because on the first time, code is always messy and dangerous, full of memory leak and high cpu/gpu cost, but it's the way it has to be done : experience (There is no secret, a developper push its hardware on very bad conditions until he get massive experience and know exactly what he is doing).<br>So, be ready to change some part because, you'll kill some pieces during your tests.<br>So, now, it's your turn ! You want to program or you just want something to be done it's up to you<br>- in the first case, DIY and be ready to loose some money in hardware !<br>- in the second case : I'm ready to do it for you, no problem. My fees : 40$/hour.<br><br>ps : <br>And by the way, unless it's something personnal not expected to be published, always target some minimum hardware, because getting something to work on a high-end machine won't help to know if it works decently on the target machine.<br>So, if you have a low-end machine, it's full of benefits and encourage you to optimise your code every time.<br><br>And thoose advices are royalty-free, so take them according to your wishes. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I've had to fight stuff like that myself from time to time. Fortunately, my game's become much more linear over time, and I currently have no need to modify finished game data at all. But gloating won't help you I guess, so let's see... just to be clear, you are saying you want your game to be a one file exe that can have its data changed while the game's running, right? My first desperate attempt to do that would probably be to have a temporary file that gets created while the game's running that no one ever sees, then after the game ends, somehow have it update the exe since it's at that point not in use, then have the temporary file delete itself, but that's just a guess. I've made lots of good guesses in the past though, and I'm pretty sure I've seen files like that appear and disappear in windowed games. Keep trying :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
