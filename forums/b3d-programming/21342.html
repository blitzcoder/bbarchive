I'll try to explain:<br><br>Was thinking of making different interior worlds with maplet, and an exterior world to connect them, something like a door you go into, and then this world goes away and you are in a new world. If this is possible how fast is the transition (player won't or will hardly notice) or would you need a transition fade or something. Once you get into the new world the old one should dissapear, but you should be able to get back to it when required.<br><br>Hope I've managed to explain. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So if the character is approaching the Yellow House, you start loading the yellow interior.  When the player approaches the Red house, you dump the Yellow Interior from memory and start loading the Red interior.  If you place the interior B3D models exactly within the exteriors, and they're the same scale, then you should be able to manage this seamlessly.   In theory, of course ;D <br><br>A good transition effect would be a fade to black, then fade to the interior scene, and a fade to white, then a fade out to the exterior scene.  This would represent the pupil's reaction to light and darkness, and would smooth the transition between interior and exterior somewhat. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Its got a global world and its full of portals. you go through a portal to each new planet. blah blah blah.. BUT this is where its sneeky. You get the leading screen up.<br><br>While this is on screen it takes about 1.2 seconds to lead the level and all game elements. BUT it does not drop the loading screen, it then takes a further 2-3 seconds to set some game elements in motion and position a few things based on previous actions. then onces all this is complete it drops the loading screen and you go in.<br><br>So having a loading screen between each level isnt such a bad thing. it can be of some use. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

When the character collided with this invisible cube I positioned the character inside the interior - way off on the other side of the world.
