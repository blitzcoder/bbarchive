Now it'd be horrifically poor taste to build the scripting language around Blitz3D so that it simply mirrors it (as well as, from the perspective of an honest person who doesn't intend to pass Blitz3D off as their own work, completely pointless). However, if:<br><br>1) your scripting language is designed to help with a particular problem, rather than competing with Blitz3D directly (eg. GameScript, which you could use to tweak NPC AI or set up quests, but doesn't explicitly contain any 3D elements) this is considered perfectly OK and normal.<br><br>2) your program doesn't output complete EXE files that include the Blitz3D engine, but rather .bb source (that people must compile with their own copy) or its own special notation, it isn't actually distributing Blitz3D, and therefore there's nothing wrong with that - as long as you don't supply the program to run such generic scripts and let users buy Blitz3D and compile it themselves.<br><br>One thing that would probably not be a problem would be to create your click'n'drag program as an editor only, and distribute that - but have it output .bb files (or a .bb framework that reads its own output format) that compile and run on the end user's Blitz3D installation. There are plenty of level- and world-editor programs available on this very site, so clearly people don't mind that.<br><br>I mention scripting languages because that's what it sounds to me like you're describing; a scripting language with a very visual kind of source. It sounds like a fun idea, and it would be a pity to give up on it just because <i>one</i> of the many possible ways of doing this would be illegal/immoral. If it takes off or demonstrates its popularity, you could always come up with another solution to allow users to create games with it directly at a later date (eg. building a more complicated backend in C++) - but it's always better to prove the concept first and worry about commercial issues later. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you mean Blitz3D users, perhaps they wouldn't be interested in a click and drag game tool but plenty of other people would be. Quest3D works this way. VirTools (used for so-called AAA games) works this way. Unity and Shiva share some similarities too. So plenty of people do like these kinds of tools, and will surely be interested in yours. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
