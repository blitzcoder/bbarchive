You can use a $100 3D engine, a free one or a $10,000 engine and this stuff isn't easy. People complain about this stuff but they don't always think it through. When you have complex alpha objects like trees, the faces can overlap. It doesn't matter what order you draw it in, it's never going to be perfect if it overlaps. This is why even AAA games resort to cheap tricks like limiting viewing angles to ensure glitches don't show, additive blending to ensure that order of drawing doesn't matter and alpha clipping/masking to avoid intermediate blending altogether.<br><br>It's easy to say it's a bug, go fix it, and I don't blame anyone for having that attitude, but it really is very hard to do it, and it really will affect the speed dramatically without giving perfect results even if you had it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
