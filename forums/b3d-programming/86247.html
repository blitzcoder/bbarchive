Following on from GfK's point, I'm finding it more and more fun to stick with Blitz3D as time goes by simply because everyone's level of expertise and general academic interest in doing things seems to be much greater now, making the community a much more focused and helpful place, along with the huge number of addons and code samples available that really speed things along. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Maybe they think this gives them the chance to create a product of a similar complexity. But then most people never do more than the beginnings of their next uber game engine. If you really want to create a "next gen" game engine then you have to invest a couple of million dollars. It won't be so much the question "Blitz3D or not", but rather "does the producer pay the production".<br><br>These days the costs of games have reached the level of hollywood movie productions.<br><br>So, when you have no budget then I guess B3D is absolutely ok. IMHO there must be a niche for low tech productions, just like movies that are not like those costy "latest-fx" shows.<br><br>IMHO It's better to make a full game in DX7-B3D than a walktrough with nothing but some DX9 features. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

To those, however, who have found a better language that more easily and efficiently allows them to achieve their lofty software-engineering goals, I salute you.

But I can make a module ( like minib3d or else ) and name it max3D. It won't be the one that was said to be "cross platform" ( and all other features M.Sibly spoke of )<br><br>I don't have any opinion like "it is bad" or "it is good", that it has not been released, so keep cool boy !<br>There is two matters :<br>+&gt; the fact<br>+&gt; my opinion<br>- the fact is :<br>a module for 3D support has been released , but it is not the one that was originally annouced ( cross platform, OpenGl &lt;and I heard about a Dx9/OGl , but that is not official, so I don't mention it&gt; and with full support from the author &lt;SAV&gt; ). The module is a DX9 engine, for windows released "as is".<br>The "real" Max3D module announced has been canceled. &lt;this is the M.Sibly's words&gt;<br><br>Then,<br>- My opinion is :<br>I don't care about the way it has been distributed, all I want from a dev-Suite is to be efficient and implicate its author in the robustness of the product. So I prefer Blitz3D . And for this opinion, you sure have not to say you 're ok or not, that 's not the point. I say what I want ^^ either you disagree.<br>So, I just say what I think, as it is asked in the main title of the topic...<br><br>ps : I think here, you got rid of many other topics speaking of max3d, and you just want to blame me now... And you should not do it ^^.<br>I'm French, so my "english" is not always very good...maybe I have not said exactly what I mean, Do you want to blame me for that ?<br><br>If you speak French here is what I think :<br>Le module 3D a été distribué il y a un petit moment, mais ça n'empêche pas qu'il n'est ni terminé, ni "officielle".<br>Donc, c'est un module 3D distribué gratuitement, ce qui est très bien, mais ça ne lui donne pas l'ampleur du module 3D originalement annoncé.<br>Et ça n'est pas une opinion, mais un fait.<br>Mon opinion ? +&gt; je n'en pense rien du tout. Je dis juste que je prefere les suites logicielles "completes" et non une suite où le module "principal" ( principal pour un projet 3D, ça va sans dire ) n'est pas certifié. Et ça, je ne vois pas en quoi tu as ton mot à dire. C'est mon point de vue, et par conséquent, tu ne peux le critiquer, ou même le contester. Je n'impose à personne d'être en accord avec ce que je dis sur ce dernier point, en revanche, tout le monde se doit de respecter l'opinion des autres, et ne pas leur imposer leur propre mode de vie. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

They do seem to have a good turn around on most issues.  But the collision system is a big deal to me.<br><br>  However recently when I re-repoted this they replied that they will "try" to fix the mesh collision system.

There's more to handle what with materials, forces and the PhysX object being separate to the blitz object, but I'm looking forward to some advantages too - such as increased speed and nicer explosions, etc. <br><br>However I think it's beneficial that Xors should handle vanilla collisions consistently too. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
