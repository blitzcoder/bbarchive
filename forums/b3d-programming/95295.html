It massively extends Blitz3D's power, and does so in a very consistent and natural way (basically a lot of it is "hidden" stuff that could have gone into Blitz3D proper but was left out by Mark for one reason or another - but there's also a lot of original content from Mikhail). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

FastExt does a great job of showing off DirectX 7's full power. Unfortunately (for it, not for us) it was superseded before graphics cards could use it properly.<br><br>As for your two options...<br><br>I'd recommend you consider which is your higher priority: finishing the product or learning a new technology, and base your choice on that. You'll probably make a much better product in the short term with B3D, whereas if you take the Irrlicht option you'll spend a lot longer bringing it up to the same standard you could have achieved quickly - learning is great and all that, but it does slow down production.<br><br>As an aside:<br><div class="quote"> I'm not too fast with C++ <br></div><br><br>C++ is one of those languages with a thousand ways to do everything. You'll work fastest if you stick to the stuff you know and introduce new language elements gradually as and when you need them (you can do a heck of a lot just using the original "C with Classes" core language). It's very, <i>very</i> easy to get confused by the vast array of options and trip up in modern C++. (Of course my point of view on C++ is well known and best summed up as "avoid it", but if you're already fairly comfortable with the language then you may as well keep going.) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
