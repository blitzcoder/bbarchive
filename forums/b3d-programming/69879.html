This would mean you'd first render the distant view followed by the close view.<br><br>Likewise if you're moving right (x+) you'd first render at xpos - 10 then the normal view (you'd had to render the distant views too).<br><br>Therefore you'll need to do 4 renders  per frame but theres not really a big hit doing multiple renders. Certainly less that duplicating all your objects and managing what's going on.<br><br>On top of this if you're rotating the cam you'll need to do something a bit clever to know what to render but certainly shouldn't be too much of a hassle to manage.<br><br>Might have to have a play with this tonight when I've got blitz infront of me.
