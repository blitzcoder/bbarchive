Is there any B3D Guru out there who knows a trick to fade between two textures on an animated mesh? I need to be able to fade between 5 textures, so any of these should be able to fade to any other one of these.<br><br>I have tried and evaluated several methods so far.<br><br>-Preredered tween textures eat too much memory, so this is not an option (it multiplies the vram needs by 6, even with only one tween frame, no way).<br><br>-Using the alpha channel of the texels of a 2nd texture layer: is too slow (writepixelfast...Vram Bottleneck problem)<br><br>-creating a clone of the wanted surface and parent it to the original mesh: new surface is not bound to the original bones, and since it's animated B3D, even if I parent it to the bone/pivot, the vertices are still not weighted the same way.<br><br>-I tried to AddMesh the new Surface that I just described to the original mesh, but for some reason it vanishes. Probably I just cannot see it because it's using the same brush, and maybe due to surface count optimation by the system the new surface is unified with the old one. I used Brushcolor to make the new surfaces brush special - to prevent the fusion, but this didn't work. I have a slight suspect that BrushColor is the one Command that does not prevent Surface Fusion of identic Brushes when AddMesh-ing things, unlike eg. BrushAlpha or so. Still got to check that later, however.<br><br>So, is there anybody who has an idea on how to smoothly fade from one texture to another, on a surface of an animated mesh?<br><br>Thanks. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It sounds rather complicated, and with the Copyrect it may also be rather slow. What makes copyrect to texturebuffers so slow is when they don't use the flag 256. But even with this flag it is still rather slow. You easily hit the limit, gameplaywise.<br><br>OJay - as far as I see you are using prerendered Frames. This would of course be an option. But I have 5 Textures, and let's say I want 3 tweenframes then I'd need to load 5*5*3 textures. I probably could load the animation sequences at runtime, but I don't like the idea. I guess this would result in new problems, pauses etc..<br><br>Let me be a bit more specific: I need this morphing because I have only a very limited number of phoneme mimic textures in a NPC lipsync animation system, and it looks rather unsmooth, even when the M is at the right place an so on. Now I want to try to fade between the Phoneme Textures to make it look more natural, liquid motion. As you may guess the texture must be faded often, along the speech of an NPC. I also don't need too much tween frames, because there ain't so many frames in one "O" or "A" or so. In fact I only want to smooth the transition a little bit.<br><br>Currently I am thinking about this way:<br>I will use 2 Texture layers on the Face surface. the 2nd Texture is created with the alpha flag, as well as the 256 VRam-Residence flag for better speed (at the cost of no mipmapping I am afraid -this could be a new problem / gfx artefact). A function SetTexAlpha allows to set all Texels alpha channels to a certain value. This way I can fade in the 2nd layer Texture as smoothly as I want. The textures are 256*256, so speedwise it could be bearable, esp. since it is done only during dialogs.<br>The amount of Vram is doubled this way. That's still much better than the prerendered Frames option.<br><br>How it works  (eg. the word "Wodka"):<br><br><br><br>set layer 0 to texture "W"<br>set layer 1 to texture "o", alpha zero<br>slowly increase alpha, so layer 0 will fade to layer 1<br><br>when alpha reaches 1.0:<br>set layer 0 to texture "o"<br>set layer 1 to texture "d", alpha zero<br>slowly increase alpha, so layer 0 will fade to layer 1<br><br>when alpha reaches 1.0:<br>set layer 0 to texture "d"<br>set layer 1 to texture "k", alpha zero<br><br>slowly increase alpha, so layer 0 will fade to layer 1<br>when alpha reaches 1.0:<br>set layer 0 to texture "k"<br>set layer 1 to texture "a", alpha zero<br>slowly increase alpha, so layer 0 will fade to layer 1<br>...<br><br>Sorry, a lot of text to explain something simple.<br><br>Nonetheless thank you very much for your help. I still hope to find something better. Wouldn't it be cool if we could apply multiple brushes to a surface? I mean, like textures, BrushAlpha would then allow to do exactly what we're talking about.<br><br>BTW. did I mention that I fixed a bug today that I was trying to debug since several months now?

I really wanted to keep it plain vanilla Blitz3D, and for this little feature of smoothing the transition I didn't want to add something like FastExt. I however hear a lot of good things, but might also remember some problems with new versions of Blitz3D (no?).<br><br>I tried hard to find a blendmode combination that allows to use the texels of one layer for the alphachannel of an other layer, which is about what OJay did with FastExt, but I am afraid (and this may also be the reason why I failed to do this a couple of years ago) it simply isn't possible in Blitz.<br><br>I will think about to buy FastExt. Unfort. I also have already spent too much money for this production, content etc., esp. when it may be Freeware one day.<br><br>I have implemented the brute force alpha channel blending I described earlier. It really works. But there is one little problem that is driving me insane:<br><br>When I fade in texture 2 over texture 1 then I must use Blendmode 1 for texture 2. But this Mode completely ignores any EntitxColor, BrushColor or Shading, so itis fading from texture 1 (with EntityColor and Shading) to a completely fullbright texture 2, an ugly, blinking artefact.<br><br>I have tried many combinations, but faied to fix this very little, very mean problem.<br><br>Here's a standalone sample:<br><br>Note: As the original DOcs say, using Alphablending Mode (1) together with multiple Texture Layers is explicitely not recommended and may result in unexpected behaviour of gfx hardware (it may quit and leave the building, you never know). So even if I can fix the problem of the fullbright alphablended layer tex2, there is still this compatibility problem.<br><br>When you run this, and when it works like on my machine, then you'll see the textures blending back and forth (pingpong like), the content of the textures are exchanged after every transition. As soon as layer 0 bcomes fully visible (because layer 1 is alphaed to zero) there will be full shading. Shading will be reduced during the transition, until it reaches the fullbright state of tex2 with alpha 1.0.<br><br>Replace<br><br>brush1=CreateBrush()<br>TextureBlend tex1,2<br>TextureBlend tex2,1<br><br>by<br><br>brush1=CreateBrush()<br>TextureBlend tex1,1<br>TextureBlend tex2,1<br><br>Now both layers are "fullbright" (actually more than that, they ignore EntityColor Brushcolor and Fading as well) and the artefact is not visible anymore, but I really don't want to use EntitxFX 1, plus EntityColor is absolutely required.<br><br>If you have any idea to solve this probem, this would be great.<br><br><pre class=code>

I have now implemented it and WOW, it's pretty good. I had some troubles to align the camera pixelperfectly since my gfx card cannot use the monitors native pixel resolution, so the screen is a bit blur all the time, makes it hard to have control over the said pixelperfection over here.<br><br>But the very positive aspect is: I can EntityTexture both quads, Renderworld it, then do one CopyRect from the backbuffer to the Texturebuffer that is actually used by the NPC's Face Surface (one layer only!), job done. Using the bespoken Flag 256 for this copyrect from backbuffer to the texture is rather fast. On my old machine it toggles between 0 and 1 ms for the whole Morphing function call.<br><br>This solution is also very robust, since it does not rely on Nonstandard Blending Operations etc. So therefor, thumbs up, tho I am a bit worried about the fact that I it wasn't my idea :). <br><br>Even if I have FastExt now, I think I'll implement it this way and play with FastExt later. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Using the 2nd UV coordinate-set to assign a 512x2 "animated" texture, with shades of gray from black to white in this texture's <b>Alpha Channel</b>.<br><br>You'd have to make all your mesh's UVs in the second channel be completely (or almost) collapsed, so as to fit in the center of a single frame of this texture (and thus have your entire mesh be sunk in the shade of gray). Each frame would be 2x2 pixels (yeah, pretty collapsed UVs).<br><br>Then you'd bind [using fastExt] your UV1 diffuse texture's alpha channel to this animated UV2 alpha-channel-only texture, and by animating the UV2 alpha-channel-only texture you'd have your UV1 texture smoothly fade into oblivion, showing the map below.<br><br>You can even set up an easy expression to get the appropriate frame, in a black to white alpha-channel-only texture:<br><pre class=code>
frame = Int(alpha*255) / 255
EntityTexture mesh, fadeTexture, ¿index?, frame
</pre>This is not very consuming since you can\should recycle this alpha-channel-only texture to all of your meshes that need this type of transition. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Fastlib - a very powerull Extension to Blitz3D, unfortunately isn't as stabile/omnicompatible as Blitz3D alone. EG. 95% of the samples didn't work on this laptop with noname onboard graphics (of course, a lot of games don't work on it, but for me it's always a good compatibility check). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
