Even trying to do so is immoral (and may actually be the illegal one of the two, depending on how you go about it. I remember your proposal last year to delete files not authorised by your program: this would quickly get your game classified as a <i>virus</i> and banned from every portal).<br><br>This is something that seems to come up a lot on the forums. The answer is: get over it. It doesn't affect you or the other players or in fact anyone if someone decides to get into the game resources and change their gameplay experience. In the <i>highly unlikely</i> even that they attempt to resell your content without a licence, you are protected by <i>copyright</i>, which is the only form of protection that matters.<br><br>Adding mechanical encryption wastes your design time, their CPU time, <i>massively</i> lowers the game's perceived value (it comes from a control-freak who doesn't believe in letting customers actually use their own stuff? Nah, I'll pass), especially if you don't include modding tools, and contributes absolutely nothing to the important areas of playability, performance, and good design.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

They can add to, modify, delete or rename that data how they see fit at their leisure in total and complete legitimacy.<br><br>They may have signed/agreed some form of licensing agreement, if you include such a detail in distributing the product, but this too, can only at most ensure that there is a contractual agreement for them to, say, "not try to modify the files for purposes that will interfer with the normal running of the game" or "circumvent or otherwise affect the code or network transmissions in order to gain an unfair advantage" etc.etc.<br>The legality concerning such agreements is another matter entirely. <br><br> Back to the original topic: <br>It sounds like what you're after is something to ensure that:<br>a) people dont cheat by modifying the executable code/media/libraries<br>b) people dont cheat by altering or fraudulently sendingor otherwise affecting the data sent to/from peer clients or servers via network<br>c) people dont decompile/crack or otherwise examine your code in order to make cheats, steal some IP relating to some procedure or process, or gain some knowledge of the games working that may allow them to gain an unfair advantage.<br><br>Unfortunately, this is all IMPOSSIBLE to prevent completely. Even the most comprehensive systems designed and envisioned by experts can be and ultimately will be circumvented, hacked themselves or otherwise 'beaten' by the unscrupulous and technically poroficient.<br><br>The reasons why?<br>1) Games require data to be stored, processed and handled on a private person's client machine.<br>2) Networked games require information to be sent from Peer-to-Peer or Server/Client.<br>3) Any processing, storing or transferance of information can be halted, examined, prevented, duplicated or falsified<br>4) There is money to be made in the ability to crack, hack, decipher, decode, decompile, reproduce, forge or otherwise find a method of cheating in products.<br>5) Any system working against cheats and cheaters must be maintained regularly. Every time a cheat/hack appears in the wild, the system must be updated to counter the threat. When this happens, the 'hackers' then work on their own update, allowing their cheat to circumvent the new level of protection. It's an endless cat &amp; mouse game, where the system is always having to catch-up.<br>6) Decompilers, Memory-readers, dissassemblers etc. are all very easily available as well as other, perfectly legitimate tools which can be abused for less ethical purposes.<br><br>Typically, the methods employed by mainstream commercial bodies at tackling aspects of cheating and unwanted modification are:<br><br>1) Customised file formats for media and 'packing of data'<br>Such specialised files will take longer to read/write, and wont be natively read by Blitz, so you'd need to have a good understanding of the data structure and how to implement it for each filetype.<br><br>2) As mentioned above, temporary unpacking, reading, then deletion.<br><br>3) File contingency checking, for example, MD5 checks etc. Version checks, Modified Date checks<br><br>4) Only send coded packets, specify certain requirements prefixing and suffixing packets etc.<br><br>5) Transmit instructions not details via the network. If those instructions are in a coded format, it will be much harder for people to determine what's being transmitted. Things like coordinates are kinda obvious to someone who knows what they're looking for.<br><br>6) Limit client-side content where possible. Depending  on the infrastructure of the game networking model, try to keep most information server-side only. For example, why download the entire map to the player, permanently if all they need is the info for where they can walk.<br><br>7) Where possible, check for 'impossible' scenarios in-game that suggest (without any doubt) player must have cheated. For example, being in inaccessible areas.<br><br>8 ) Ensure some form of Administrative oversight to servers or for P2P gaming, perhaps some form of voting. It wont protect your code so much, but at least will make players feel more secure and give them the ability to deal with cheaters runing their experience.<br><br>____________________________________________________________________<br><br><br>Lastly, I dont know the stage you are at with your game, but considerations such as these are best left to the end of development, once your game is pretty much complete - otherwise, it can and most probably will be harder for you to make changes and debug what you're working on. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
