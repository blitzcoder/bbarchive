Inside the main loop is a timer which updates at whatever times per second (60 for a normal game I guess) which branches off and executes the game code, then I leave the drawing code in the rest of the main loop with a Flip False (no VWait) - having it redraw the screen as often as it can.<br><br>With regards to the -not- mipmapping thing, it could still be mipmapping - I'v heard it can be persistant depending on what detail level your drivers are set to - go into your advanced display properties and have a fiddle around.  I always leave my mipmapping on the highest detail cuz things like HUDs can screw up like this and it's not always immediately obvious =] <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's up to you to get the scaling right. Many methods in code archvies. See hud code.<br><br>Render tweening is always better framerate wise, than brute force methods. This is because it only renders when it absolutely has to, saving a fair bit of time. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Mip mapping only affects textures far away; when near there is a sort of antialiasing (bilinear filtering I think) which affects textures.  Unfortunately that filtering is done automatically by your 3D card and can't be turned off.<br><br>As for timing, I recommend the delta time approach.  I've you've not seen that try looking for Steady Detla Time in the Code Archives.  The gist is you allow the game to render as fast as it can and keep track of how much time is passing between frames, scaling everything which happens in the game (eg. all movements) according to that delta time. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

[I am using PointEntity to guide objects to their objectives and some targets cause pitching --&gt; tunneling/flying. Some entities also manage to burrow through scenery as if it wasn't there, while others get jammed in the walls ! ] <br><br>Is it possible that this is due to the tweening process... where the object is halfway through a collision during the tween update and so doesn't get 'bounced' properly ? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
