</pre><br><br>Now, the question is, I set the default difficulty setting to medium.  However, I'd like to set different tiers of enemy speeds to make the game more difficult and faster, if you choose to make the game harder, or slower and easier if you opt for the easiest of settings.  This will be more enjoyable of a game if I can adjust the speed based on different levels of play.  Obviously the physical code would be similar, but the enemy's speed would be factored in, and possibly the speed that the bullets fly, too, not too sure.    Where would you place the menu for adjusting the difficulty, and would you need to write different functions for each difficulty level? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
