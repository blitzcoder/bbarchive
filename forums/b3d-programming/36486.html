I've been considering trying to write an app that would allow you to have one or more "master skeletons" animated with all the cycles the game requires.  Then all of the characters would have skeletons prerigged, but without animation keyframes attached to them.  Then, the goal is to copy the segments of desired keyframes from one skeleton to another.  The skeletons would have to have the same naming convention, but I think it could be done by retrieving the data from the master skeletons, and then copying it to the target skeletons with SetAnimKey..  I haven't tried it yet, just something I've been tossing around in my feeble little brain.  Seems like that would make your chore easier if it can be done. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I've been looking at Castle Wolfenstein, and a lot of the chars have identical gestures - they must access them from a common file(?)<br><br>Further thoughts: One way would be to have the same master (bodyless) skeleton which is loaded in for _each_ char as a reference. Then animate whichever sequence the char requires in its master skeleton, and copy the movments to the visible character.<br>Obviously, all chars' bones would have to be, and named, the same; but that's not too bad.<br><br>I really would appreciate any and all comments on this topic.<br>I'm about to start a ton of work and I don't want to get to the end of it then slap myself on the forehead and say 'Oh no, if only I'd known!'. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

However, if you have a mesh that is almost exactly the same, you could use it as a template to model other characters. If you have a bone weight mesh already setup, you can always tweak that mesh to create a new character keeping the weights intact - but it's a messy job.<br><br>As for using animations on different meshes, then as you say using a master skeleton would do the job (if all named bones where the same) although it would mean copying all movement across every frame. Also one other big problem I see is that if you needed to run different animations on different meshes, you'd have to have a master skeleton per animation!<br><br>Another method, although a bit more involved but would save time in the long run would be to write a small app that takes the animation keys from one blitz file and place them into another - so each character has all the animations it needs. Of course this would take more memory up (but hey, PC's can handle it) but at least then you don't have to copy over all the bone info to each character, and you can run lots of different animations per character without additional overhead.<br><br>There is also the added bonus that if you do make an app that can do that - everyone can use it, and they will love you forever :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
