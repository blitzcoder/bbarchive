The Items are loaded in<br>and I visually see them. <br><br>I have a "Delete Item" button. When I have the Item selected<br>and press Delete Item the item vanishes without a hitch.<br><br>I also have a "New Character" button. This is used to view a <br>different character. <br><br>When the New Character button is pressed I naturally need to<br>clean out all and any already loaded Items from the Item type.<br><br>Using the same exact method I use for Delete Item I attempt<br>to clean the type up and Free the Item using FreeEntity()<br><br>Seems easy? Thats what I thought , but for the life of me I can not<br>see why I am erroring out. Says Entity Doesnt Exist when I <br>press New Char button and points right at my FreeEntity(item\itemEN)<br><br>Heres the code<br><pre class=code>

Here's the kicker: <b>FreeEntity()</b> does indeed delete the entity from memory, BUT for reasons unknown to me, it doesn't make the entity's handle 0. Instead, it changes it to some other integer which means nothing to me. The handle still doesn't point to an entity, though, which means <b>FreeEntity()</b> will of course produce an MAV. My solution was to add a second line that set the entity's handle to 0 immediately after <b>FreeEntity()</b> had been called, then have a line in the manner of:<br><br><pre class=code>;Pseudocode here

If Entity\Handle
    FreeEntity(Entity\Handle)
    Entity\Handle = 0
EndIf</pre><br><br>That should solve your problem. Just make it so that <b>FreeEntity()</b> is called only in the case of a non-zero handle, and set the handle TO zero when it's freed. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

All seems in order.<br><br>UPDATE: Ok, It was me and my code the entire time. I managed to free the MeshEN to early. I moved the item deletion above the Mesh deletion <br>and all seems fine. Im still very confused as to why I was crashing due to the fact the mesh and items have no true connection besides visual.<br>I do have the items set to a Bone Parent... Thats the only connection.<br>If I delete the Mesh ( the rig deletes also ) would that of caused a error?<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Because FreeEntity will free all of the target entity's children as well; but it won't do anything about the item instance since it doesn't know about those. This means that if children are further along in the item list than their parents, the 3D entity will already have been freed by the time the loop gets around to that item instance.<br><br><div class="quote"> for reasons unknown to me, it doesn't make the entity's handle 0 <br></div><br><br>The entity no longer has a handle, because it doesn't exist. The memory address in the integer variable now points to empty space.<br><br>If you're wondering why the variable wasn't set to zero, it's because only the <i>value</i> of variables is passed to functions. There's no way for the function to reach backwards down the call stack and somehow affect variables in a lower call frame, as it has no way to tell which variable that value came from (and it could easily be more than one - almost certainly). Even if it could, this would be very bad as it has no idea what else you might be using that integer for (because it's <i>just</i> an integer, not strongly-typed to be an entity).<br><br>The whole by-value vs by-reference thing can get a little confusing because it looks like type instances and 3D entities are passed directly, but what you're actually passing is the integer address of their block of memory - so you're still only passing a <i>copy</i> of a value, and that value can't be affected outside the function.<br><br>If this issue is confusing you heavily, you might want to take a quick holiday in the land of the C programming language: its full support for explicit pointers makes it a great way to learn the difference between passing by value and by reference, which will help your understanding of B3D's memory model enormously as it's basically a cut-down version of the same thing.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
