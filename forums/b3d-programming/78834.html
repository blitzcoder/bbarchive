Not just be a hard copy of the command reference file.<br><br>I really appreciate the forum but wish there was some way that the blitz 3D beginner section could have some type of logical progression links that have a format that starts with the very basics <br>in topics and then have progressive links as one becomes more comfortable with the language instead of everything just thrown <br>in together <br><br>That is just my two cents and probably isn't worth much but I again <br>want to say that I am thankful for this forum and even though I still <br>pretty much don't have a clue hope that I can search and find the info I am seeking because I know there already is a great deal of <br>knowledge to be extracted from this forum. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
