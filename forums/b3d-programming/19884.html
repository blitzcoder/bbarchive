If a few of us put down some money, we can hire a professional 3D artist to produce a generic human fully-animated model.  A few people suggested that we just get an untextured, uv-mapped, animated model, so that it can be textured to look like nearly any human character, and I thought it was a great idea.<br><br>I have been contacting artists, and so far, the only one that really meets my approval can be found at www.worldpowerstudio.com.  I am submitting the link here for your review of the material.  Please feel free to look for more potential hires yourself, and report back with any good finds you get.<br><br>The result of this would be that we would have a fully animated high-quality human character for all our games, that could be added to, skinned, or tweaked pretty easily.  This is something a lot of people I have talked to need, and something I need myself.<br><br>Once an appropriate artist is agreed upon, we need to talk about money.  I'd rather have Blitz Research set something up, as I wouldn't feel entirely comfortable handling it myself.  I am guessing a pro animated model will run us about $1,000.  The price per person will depend entirely on how many people go in on it, so if you are interested, now's a good time to speak up. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'll put that much in, and a few other people said they would.  It would be good to say for sure if you intend to, so we have a better idea of how much money we can offer them.  Maybe we could charge $100 for anyone who wants to license the model after that, and split the money between the original investors.

If we sold the model as an online download through sharit at about $25 (the extra $5 to cover their fees) and the original model cost $1000 we'd only have to shift about 50 copies to break even - thus getting our character for nothing! Anything after the 50 copies would be profit that we could split on a % basis decided by how much of the original investment we put in. <br><br>Considering the fact that we could SELL to DB users as well, 50 copies doesn't seem too much to hope for, and $100 (~£66) doesn't sound too risky.

Obviously legally that is true, but ethically you would be really screwing the artist.  In the short term perhaps that fact doesn't matter to you but taking just the short term view is a good way to screw yourself in the future.  Unless you specify ahead of time that you intend to resell his work doing so would be very much violating the spirit of the deal.  What happens if your game is successful and you attempt to contract artists in the future?

You'd each spend $100 and only end up with one (or maybe two) models that will be used by more than one person for 3D games.

And because of that it will be obvious when other people use the same model in their games. But nobody wants to use the same model that gets used by other developers, it takes the originality out of your game. It's like the "Poser" series of animated meshes that gets used time and time again: everybody tires of it, because everybody uses it.<br><br>And surely you can't suggest using it as a placeholder! $1000 for a placeholder? :O<br><br>So I won't be donating money to halo's "grant".

Plus, if you've got the artistic talent to create a top quality texture then you should be able to make your own decent models with a bit of practice. It's not that difficult to do.<br><br>Perhaps you could remodel the character a bit to make it suit your needs, right? Well, that takes almost as much effort and skill as modelling a character from scratch, particularly if you made significant changes to the model geometry.<br><br>Besides, you're probably going to need a whole bunch of characters for an average game, so even if you only contribute $100 dollars for each character you're going to end up spending a significant amount of money (for the average amature developer that is) and end up with a bunch of really generic characters.<br><br>Another point that bears mentioning is this: As an amature game developer you can't really compete with the big boys as far as production values go, but you *can* compete by creating games that are original and unique. This aaplies to your game's visuals. Plunking a bunch of models into your game that lots of other people are also using isn't exactly going to achieve this.
