Does anyone know any good extensions for Blitz3d that can produce such effects on Windows 8? I'm experimenting with a cell-shaded art-style akin to Jet Set Radio, and dynamic character shadows would really complete the effect (I plan on baking shadows into the game environments via Blender.) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Even without FastExt the problems rise ...<br><br>Off Topic ...<br><br>Some days ago I made changes in my NVidia settings - because I wanted to find out if I can *repair* a windowed problem with one of my blitz programs - which runs superb in fullscreen 1920x1080x32 on XP, Vista, Win 7, many Win 8.1 afaik, but not in a borderless window of any size ... although the framerate is stable at 60 FPS - there's time for 100 times more operations which are actually done each frame - but still there are visible (lags) lerks (? don't know a better translation) ...<br>I must add - only on a quite new Win 8.1 Laptop I have it works in both modes highest resolution without any visible problem - no lerks at all. But on a high end gaming system of my son, Win 8.1 it lerks fullscreen and windowed ... that's what made us serching for the reason ...<br><br>I assumed I could find out more about it, making NVidia settings changes on my Win 7 Pro System ...<br>After only 3 changes the Program produced a MAV ... running it in Debug mode it showed that it stops at Flip() ... trying some easy examples from the docs it showed again that each test stopped at Flip()<br>How can changing filtering, prerendering, etc. in the NVidia settings stop working Flip() in Blitz3D completely? I don't know - but it does!<br><br>I made a reset in the NVidia Settings and Flip() worked again.<br><br>Back to topic: That's what makes me sure that it has nothing to do with the Blitz Version - but is a graphics driver matter - which coincidentically occured together with a Blitz Version change ... but was the actual cause.<br>So (not meant honest but with a winking eye) you probably would have success not changing the Blitz Version, but using a 5 year old graphics card driver ...)<br><br>Well ... maybe we should face it ... the time for Blitz3D is running out ... slowly but unstoppable ... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

</pre><br><br>One thing that i have never seen anyone talk about is why most of you don't put setbuffer(backbuffer()) before renderworld()... Because as i understand it, renderworld() converts the meshes, textures, animations, lighting, of the 3d scene into the pixels of an image and puts it in the activebuffer, then flip() puts the activebuffer in the frontbuffer and displays it to the user.<br>But if the activebuffer is not set to be the backbuffer, how renderworld() is supposed to know in which buffer to put the image of the render and what will be flipped to the frontbuffer ?<br>So except if renderworld() automatically sets the activebuffer to be the backbuffer, i think that it is important to put Setbuffer(backbuffer()) before renderworld(). <br>A bad mainloop structure may produce weird results with some graphic cards... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
