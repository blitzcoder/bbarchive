People do not learn like this.  The most influencial mathematicians in history started out by counting beans.  You cannot jump directly from zero to awesome - be prepared to put some work into it.  Do the little projects that mean nothing until you learn everything you need to know for your bigger projects.<br><br>Software development is a lot like erecting a building.  The code that you write becomes the floors of the building; as you progress, you build on the floors you've already built.  If your architecture is well thought out, the floors will fit together nicely (easy to code) and the building will be sturdy (bug-free).  If you have to change your plans part-way through, your foundation will be supporting renovations that were not planned for in your architecture; your building will not be as sturdy and will not fit together as well.  Even if you go back and fix your load-bearing code, your design will likely never be as clean and sturdy as one that originally planned for things properly in the first place.  It's entirely possible to reach a point where you cannot sanely keep building without going back and destroying entire floors, if not the entire building.  The larger the project, the more important planning is, because you might never reach the top - and not through lack of trying.  A skyscraper could not be built without a flawless plan: one mistake with the load-bearing members on the ground floor and the thing would never reach completion without crashing to the ground.<br><br>The moral of this mixed analogy is that huge projects require meticulous planning, meticulous planning requires understanding of the processes which will be employed, and this understanding would be reached far more easily with simple projects where there's less to worry about and less to be fixed when you make mistakes.  You will make mistakes - everyone does.  Mistakes are valuable for learning.  Plan on making them.  If you make 2 simultaneous mistakes on a small project, you may learn 2 valuable lessons.  If you make 200 simultaneous mistakes on a large project, will you learn anything or simply have a huge mess on your hands that you don't understand?<br><br>If you don't want to learn, don't bother posting here - no one is going to do your project for you unless you offer money.  If you're offering money, you might have better luck with a service oriented for that (e.g. rentacoder.com).<br><br><div class="quote"> dont comment on this statement just watch for me <br></div><br><br>Huh?
