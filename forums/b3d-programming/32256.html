Joking around makes the forum fun. <br></div><br><br>Well let me see here sswift ol' buddy... There one thing in<br>joking around with someone in a fun way! It's another thing<br>when you say sarcastic things when someone is asking for help and your not being helpful at all! You'll find out in life when someone is serious about something, It's not funny to joke around with them when they are asking something serious! It would be like someone dying and you make a joke about it. You'll find in a situation like what I just discribed to you that most of the people if not all of them around at that time the joke was mentioned... You'll find most of them wont be laughing at your joke! So think about it for a minute! There's a time for joking with someone. And there's a time not to also!<br><br>And on another personal note to your reply. If someone has to come off with a sarcastic remark first towards me, Id' rather that they wouldn't post nothing to me anyways!<br>It's just like the old saying... "If you can't say nothing nice to someone... Then don't say nothing at all!"<br><br>And also! I am quite understanding to the fact that I wont<br>get a reply for awhile if maybe not at all. So dont try to dictate to me about how im' supposed to be!<br><br><br><div class="quote"> @halo <br></div><br><br>Thank's for the info dude! I was just curious as to what you used!

I have read similar post from the past on here very similar to mine! So quit making it out like im' the only one on these forums that has did this sort of thing!<br><br>And im' tired of saying im' sorry for this as I have said it enough! If people on these forums can't read and understand what I've said a many of times now! The the heck with it! everybody makes mistakes in life! And that includes everyone here on these forums too! NOBODY'S PERFECT!!!!<br><br>DoctorWho is now materializing into another time period<br>so c' ya' later people!<br><br><div class="quote"> @WolRon <br></div><br><br><div class="quote"> The real Doctor Who would never fly off the handle like that. <br><br>This is obviously an imposter. <br> <br></div><br><br>How in the heck would you know anyways!!!!

How can someone get to the point where they make a compelte and utter distinction between a "2D" and "3D" programming language?
