Even something relatively old like ODE should still give you a performance improvement, and instead of being limited to one-way slides and stops, you get full rigid body dynamics.<br><br>You've got other options too, but this is a huge "depends what you want it for" area. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I have had only 2 problems :<br>-&gt;when a collider emitter is created and already intersects with a collider receiver. Then when the collider emitter moves, it goes through the collider receiver.<br>-&gt;when i try to retrieve the normal of a collided point and the collided point is near the side of a triangle (for example the side of a cube) the retrieved normal does not seem to be what it should be.

In this case, it's more like the squeaky wheel gets the grease, and the whole reason Blitz3D has so many great addons is because of people doing what you've done here.<br><br>As for the collision system actually sucking, I solved a lot of my biggest problems with it by just doing a bunch of trial and error. There are quite a lot of variables to work with afterall. For my uses, I ended up settling on a spherical collider shrunk by x and z and stretched by y, so it's like a pencil, and I don't remember what for the other settings, but just keep playing around with it. Some of my best modules took tons of trial and error, but then you finally get it right and it's just awesome! I once made a previous move independent mesh rotator... yup, every vertex had a place in a txt file! Not an overnight project. But if anyone needs it, just ask and I'll post it.<br><br>Speaking of, as eluded to in the previous post, for those times when your brain just short circuits, you can always post your code here for someone else to take a crack at it. One of the biggest reasons I got Blitz3D was I kept hearing over and over online that it has such a great support community, and that's been true all along. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
