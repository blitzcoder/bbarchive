Even if I was  a big budget game company I would steer away from it.  I cannot be bothered with a video tool which takes hours to compress video and does not even provide pre-compressed sample videos for download so that I can compare how it looks with real and computer generated video when compared to quicktime or divx.

But if you use WMV then you can be realtively sure they will be able to decode it, and that's MPEG4. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

They have practicaly been around for a decade and have an amazing endorsement record, since the late days of DOS/Win 3.11 their format has been one of the frequently used (3rd party) video formats in gamedevelopment. Take the trouble of looking at a few games with FMVs in it recently, lets say for example, splinter cell: pandora tomorrow? A quick look in their video folder shows .BIK files, how about all of the Command and Conquer games, the proof of this programs usefullness is demonstrated by these games. (ofcourse a few demo movies would be nice) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
