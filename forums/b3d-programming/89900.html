That's up to you as well, determined clever people can do whatever they set their minds to, so I would only try to create barriers within reason to prevent the lazy hacker. you'll never prevent the relentless ones from doing what they want.

Plus:<br><br><div class="quote"> <br>1 - is very advanced and complicated to do something?<br> <br></div><br>Yes and no. You need an online database which to communicate with. You can start, as test platform, using your local pc and install a MySql database server. I would highly recommend the good (and free) Apache web server.<br>Once done, create the database tables you need.<br>When everything works on your local pc, then you can replicate the database on your remote server, and test the game in a 'real' environnment.<br><div class="quote"> <br>2 - there is a limit of users that can connect in this way?<br> <br></div><br>It depends on the database capacity. But before to worry about this issue, get the game done :)<br><div class="quote"> <br>3 - a system is safe, or is easily modifiable?<br> <br></div><br>As RifRaf said, you can't prevent everything. But you can add some level of protection if you send encrypted data.<br><br>There is a DLL that can make your database communication a breeze, it's called ETNA, is free and is compatible with Blitz3D and BlitzMAX.<br>I use it in my Asteroids game to save the score on an online database. (the game is located in the section 'Work In Progress' on my website in case you want to take a look).<br><br>Etna (in Blitz Toolbox): <a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/toolbox/toolbox.php?tool=160" target="_blank">http://www.blitzbasic.com/toolbox/toolbox.php?tool=160</a><br><br>Hope it helps,<br>Sergio. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
