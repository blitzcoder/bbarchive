The two are 1:1 <i>in B3D</i> - every time you define a data structure, the engine will automatically create a linked-list of every instance of that type that you create - but that's solely a design decision by Mark, and on a theoretical or logical level, the two aspects of Type-in-B3D have <i>nothing to do with each other</i>. It's only there for your convenience, and there are plenty of other ways to store and access collections of objects, or to get list functionality.<br><br>So if you're still not too familiar with individual objects being created on the heap and passed around by reference, you should start by <i>completely ignoring</i> anything to do with the For/Each command (and its friends First/Last/Before/After/Insert): this is really something else entirely, and will <i>not</i> help you understand what the data structures/by-ref semantics are. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

</pre><br>then you can access everything with globals\var1 etc..<br>why?<br>..well, the reason for this is that it is the only "strict" var referencing in b3d, and will not permit you to make variable spelling mistakes (something that is a HUGE debug pain in non-strict languages).<br><br><br><br>One thing about using types in B3D though (and javascript actually), if you have a function that has a lot of -really- heavy repeated processing of type variables, it is faster to "unpack" them into simple local variables .
