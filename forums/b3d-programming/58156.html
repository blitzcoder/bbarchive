Some are easy and simple, some are advanced and high AI.<br><br>A simple way is to check if the enemy can see the player (camera in a fps) and start shooting at him if so.<br><br>The enemy may move around in the map during his attacks. This may be along fixed "waypoints", or freely using pathfinding algorithms.<br><br>I would suggest not to use pathfinding since it's hard to make it right.<br><br>You may add a simple pseudo-pathfinding thing that allows the enemy to use multiple paths to try to get closer to the player, or to follow him.<br><br>That's firearms attacks. Physical attacks on contact may be a bit harder. Defensive "hits" is easy, but an offensive attack requires the enemy to run towards the player, probably leaving his waypoint lines.<br><br>this may be useful.<br><a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/codearcs/codearcs.php?code=505" target="_blank">http://www.blitzbasic.com/codearcs/codearcs.php?code=505</a><br><a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/codearcs/codearcs.php?code=968" target="_blank">http://www.blitzbasic.com/codearcs/codearcs.php?code=968</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The literature on them is unfortunately quite convoluted, so I'll try to explain the basics.<br><br>Each actor keeps track of what it's currently doing.  For this example, "idling", "approaching", and "attacking" will be the possible values of actor\state$.<br><br>In the actor's update routine, we switch (Select Case) on the state$.<br><br>case "idling" : check the distance from the player.  If we're close enough to see him (insert line-of-sight check here,) set state$="approaching" else walk in a random direction <br><br>case "approaching" : make sure we're still close enough to see the player.  if not, set state$ = "idling".  if so, walk towards the player (insert pathfinding here.)  if we're within attacking distance, set state$ = "attacking"<br><br>case "attacking" : make sure we're still close enough to attack.  if not, set state$ = "approaching".  if so, perform an attack animation.<br><br>Although it seems that you could simply switch on the distance, keeping track of state lets you get more complicated behaviours.  For example, you could keep track of a timer variable for an attack animation and not make any distance checks or state changes until it has expired: once an actor has commited to an attack, he will follow through (unless interrupted by damage or something.)<br><br>Hope this helps! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
