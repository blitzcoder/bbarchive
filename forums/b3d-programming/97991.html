All that means is that for that <i>one vertex</i>, the U and V will now be whatever you passed to VertexTexCoords instead of whatever you originally set them to in the fifth and sixth parameters of AddVertex.<br><br>So, to "move" a quad, you need to adjust all of the vertices of that quad, not just use one command. To display the red zone only on the quad mesh in your example, you could add this:<br><br><pre class=code>VertexTexCoords surf, v0, 0  , 0
VertexTexCoords surf, v1, 0.5, 0
VertexTexCoords surf, v2, 0.5, 0.5
VertexTexCoords surf, v3, 0  , 0.5</pre><br><br><br>This is now exactly the same as if you'd created the quad using the AddVertex command with different parameters:<br><br><pre class=code>v0 = AddVertex (surf,  -1, +1, 0,  0  , 0)
v1 = AddVertex (surf,  +1, +1, 0,  0.5  , 0)
v2 = AddVertex (surf,  +1, -1, 0,  0.5  , 0.5)
v3 = AddVertex (surf,  -1, -1, 0,  0  , 0.5)</pre><br><br><br>That's all it does!<br><br>(I assume you're comfortable with U and V coordinates and that they are a float between 0, the top/left, and 1, the maximum extreme to the bottom/right, yes?) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

(ie CreateCube())<br><br>Naming them v0/v1/v2 etc is fine for my simple example, but if you then use AddMesh to try and create a single surface mesh from say 100 of them, finding the correct vertices/coords to texture with the relevant part of the texture atlas seems like it would be trial and error?<br><br>Iteration through the vertices wouldn't work as I still wouldn't know which was which, but I'm sure there might be some clever maths involved for finding the right part of the texture (texture and tile width/height etc)<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You can get the vertices for a particular triangle using TriangleVertex, but that still leaves you to 1) get the triangle somehow (pick?); and 2) work out which of the three triverts os the one you want to modify (which will depend on things like orientation vs. the camera).<br><br>This is one of those areas where "it depends what you want to do"; you'll need to establish a few mesh-handling conventions of your own, that reflect whatever it is you actually want to do with the mesh.<br><br><br>Side note with regard to the first question again: if you try to use every single pixel as part of your atlas, you may experience some "bleeding" as the texture filters surrounding regions into the bit you're actually using. You might want to investigate some combination of making your subtextures slightly smaller (e.g. a 1px border), or the Clamp UV texture flags, to prevent this side effect. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
