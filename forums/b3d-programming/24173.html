I don't see why ppl who buy "shareware" couldn't buy games that need more ooomph from the comp than what Celeron can give? Are ppl who buy "shareware" games really using only antique hardware?

I mean, no offense, but many blitz games aren't going to make it to well as far as # of sales. Lowering this even more by making a game that only runs on an extremly modern machine is fairly stupid in this situation. Of course, if someone did however create a good game and advertised it well, this problem wouldn't exist. Commercial game developers don't have to worry about this to much, as they often times sell to customers that game alot and thus most likely have a good computer. Satisfying and maintaining these customers would be more bennificial to the game company than satisfying the people who don't game much, and have a lower chance of buying more of the companies games.<br><br>Note: I know nothing of the gaming business. I just think that for a Blitzer who wants to actually sell a game, supporting low-end machines is a good strategy. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you follow the Dexterity forums at www.dexterity.com/forums you can get several reason to cut down the download size:<br>*First simple reason that bigger download size means bigger bandwith ratings -&gt; bigger service provider costs (it's a huge impact to have 10 meg demo instead of 3 meg demo) =&gt; for example modem users are really critical when downloading demo - especially if you have to pay for each minute<br><br>*With DirectX7 (which Blitz uses) you simply can't compete with DirectX9 if you think of graphical elements (this doesn't say you can't have cool looking game - it's just fact that others will have ever cooler looking games)<br><br>*It's quite different to compete in shareware market than competing in retail business (or similar - as I can see you have quite much experience in the cutting edge tech demos)<br><br>*Not all people have AMD XP2000+ with GeForce Ti4 - there are simply so many computers with GF2 etc. that trying to aim higher specs will results in lesser sales.<br><br>But as said: you can do this just for fun, or you can do this for the money. But you can't beat million dollar budgeted retail game visually using just Blitz3D.<br><br>But hey, I don't want to argue about this.
