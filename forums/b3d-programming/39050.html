Think of every problem/need as a series of smaller tasks. <br>For example, you have a player, a alien and a car in your scene/game. <br>Firstly, you want the player up and running. Do you code this directly? Cool right? It'll be up and running in minutes. Now, come the alien's turn..uh oh, you have to do it all again..<br>But, with the power of module-based coding you could instead group them all together, think of them as actors...Now you have an actor class, a type...object.<br>Write once, work for everything in the future. If not? Improve it, and it's improved for everything already in and that will be in. Retroactive coding. :)<br><br>I never used to do this, and always without fail projects died. Now, they still die, but it's not because of that...;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There's no reason not to code it to get the logic flowing in your mind and just see how things work.  I do that all the time and I get games done.<br><br>Anyway ... that's all about code and you said you're looking for a beginning.

Then I expanded upon it with a rather large document (something like 50 pages of mindless crap that only I could understand because it happens to use loads of terms that I made up during my last projects) detailing all aspects of the project, what would be required, and priorities.  I code in a modular way, so everything is essentially a sub-object of the core (upon initialising the engine [yes, it's an engine] you are given the option to initialise its sub-systems, for example, the GUI, shader system, scripting engine, etc. so only what's neccessary is created- you can, of course, initialise sub-systems after the engine is initialised in the case that you need to start up one when needed).  All of these sub objects rely upon information provided by the core system (which handles math, input, and the window), and typically they do not rely upon any other system outside of the core.<br><br>Anyhow... back to how I organize my projects.  After writing up the documents on what's what and goes where, I design a few flow charts to illustrate how the systems work, what their relations to the core/other systems is, and what they need to handle their operations efficiently.<br><br>Then comes the part I enjoy quite thoroughly: coding.  This consists of creating a project group in Protean and working on the highest priority systems first (the core being at the top, obviously- in the case of my latest engine, it goes core system, stack, math, string, buffers, and so on and so forth) until I get to the last and most insifignifigant piece  of the project and finish it.<br><br>Throughout these steps I revisit the documents and flow charts to see if there's a way I could revise them to make them better and more descriptive.  Appropriately changing code where neccessary.<br><br>It's a bit of a messy way of organizing a project, I think, but so far it has worked fine for this project. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Your function becomes :<br>Function Updatecarphysics()<br>For car.tcar=each tcar<br>If car\ai=1 then doAI(car.tcar);if the car is an AI player<br>do stuff<br>next<br>End Function<br><br>So you have to write a single AI function and all the AI cars will be updated by it.<br><br>An approach like this means that when you decide to make a massive change in the direction of your game (which happens a lot) you only have to alter the bits of the functions that you don't like. So imagine you now want your AI cars to fire rockets - all you do is change the doAI() function and its in :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In a nutshell, you now have an end result - there is no reason why you cannot add your own touches.  If you do a clone, you already know how the game will play and could (technically) pre-empt how it was put together.  You can then just break down the gameplay.  Something like Pac-Man is good.<br><br>I think a clone is a good idea as you have a clear goal - it doesn't mean it is easy to do, you'll just know what you have to achieve.<br><br>Plus, it will make it easier for you to get help - coz other people have done clones - so just pick a popular clone (pac-man, space invaders - you get my point). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
