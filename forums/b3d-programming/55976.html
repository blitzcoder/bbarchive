Here's a simplified idea of what I want:<br><br>What I have is a 2d grid map; one or more squares are set as 'generators' and produce power, others are 'buildings' and have to be connected to another powered structure such as another building, or a generator to receive power.<br><br>Now, I can get a simple 'powering up' to work, but it's not perfect since if you shut the generator down, the buildings don't power down properly. I'm doing this by checking the buildings next to the current one and if one of them is powered, then the current building also gets powered. Of course, this doesn't work when you turn off the generator because two or more buildings will 'recharge' themselves. I've tried several variations on the basic theory, and none of them seem to work properly.<br><br>I hope this makes sense, if not I'll post a simple example. There has to be a simple way of doing this, I can't see using a complex pathfinding routine for every single building as that would really slow everything down and over complicate things.<br><br>Any thoughts? Ta. :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Each time a generator is created run the algo and add 1 to the powered field. Each time it is down decrease the powered field. Not sure how many nodes you have but shouldn't take long. You could always show an electrical arc anim on the generator while you're doing it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The generator type should contain a linked list of all buildings it's powering, either directly, or in-directly.<br><br>The building type should contain a field identifying the generator it's being powered by, if any.<br><br>When you power-down a generator, go through the linked list and power-down all buildings.<br><br>When you create a new building next to a powered one, find which generator that building is being powered by and add the new building to it's linked list. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The problem relates to the tile map of buildings and power lines.  Removing a tile might shut off the power to a whole suburb, or there might be piles of redundancy in place.<br><br>Because of the myriad of different paths electricity can take through your buildings and power lines, I think some sort of "pathfinding" is the only way to properly solve this problem.<br><br>This hypothesis is supported by the fact that even the newer versions (e.g. 4) of SimCity take a few moments to decide that a building has lost or gained power, suggesting that there is pathfinding going on, spread out over the course of many frames to avoid slowdown.<br><br>My suggested approach would be to send out "pulses" of power from your generators - a very similar approach to your original strategy.  All your buildings would have a "most recently powered" field, and if the power is more than two pulses old, the building is unpowered.  Only one pulse would go out at a time.  Every frame, you'd spend a certain amount of time extending the pulses to adjacent buildings.<br><br>I'll do up a quick and dirty demo to show you what I mean. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
