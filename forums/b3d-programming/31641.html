I mean we could very well write our own engines...<br>Seriously, having to do things that blitz already does but do not expose is just the result of an obvious lack in blitz. Plus everytime you have to do such workarounds to write your libs, you put an additional and unneeded dependancy that make it harder to integerate with other libs.<br><br><div class="quote"> A call to get information is just slower than making an array <br><br>Dim Cameras.CamType(x) <br><br>so it's normally a far better idea to save information than request it realtime <br> <br></div>That's a pretty poor argument actually, because blitz has the ability to inline every call to built-in commands. Don(t ask me if it does, but it *could* easily, in which case it would be even faster than using an array, *and* transparent. And quite frnakly, I couldn't care less from any "overhead" here. These kind of infinitesimal overheads can only have an impact if you call the function thousands of times, like in an intensive inner loop. In which case you can simply call the funciton once before the loop and store it in a variable, and access that variable in the loop.<br>So in fact what *is* a far better idea is to drop this habit of seeking optimizations in places where it hasn't the slightest impact on speed. Better think higher level, and do local optimization only where and when needed. Just my 2 cents. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Then these functions become essential, because you don't know what variable, if any, the main program stores the value in.  When writing a generic library, it's best if it is as muich of a "black box" as possible, operating without outside uesr input.  <br><br>It's very annoying to have to force the user to call say, "GUI_SetCameraViewPort" in addition to the Blitz function to set the camera's viewport size every time they want to set the viewport size.<br><br>That is a poor example though, because it oversimplifies the problem.  <br><br>Even if you call a special setcameraviewport for a single camera, what if you have two?  What if you also change their fog color, fog range, and their near and far range?  Now you've got a problem cause you're either going to have to pass that information every time you update the system for the specific camera you're rendering to at that time, or you're going to be forced into a one camera system, or worse, you might be forced to call special funcions to "add" and "free" cameras in the GUI system when you make a new camera so that it can loop through them all and find the one referenced by the user so it can access its data...  And then you'll still be stuck calling functions to update this data when you make a change to anything.<br><br>I'm not being unrealistic here either... I've run into this problem on numberous occasions when writing my systems.  Most annoying is the lack of a set of functions to dtermine entity scale on each axis, though thankfully it is possible to calculate that manually by accessing the transformation matrices.  Still, it sucks having to have an entityscaleX, EntityscaleY, and entityscalez function in every lib with a different name.  It would be nice if they were built in with the ideal name instead.  And requiring the user to include one or more additional libraries with just those functions in it is not acceptable because that makes using the stuff more confusing. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I don't know how blitz does things internally, but I do think that one general command could do something like this. <br><br>An example of what I am saying for the camera is: <br>If we could get a handle to were a camera is stored in memory, and at what offset the zoom factor is by using a peek or poke command, we could read or write the zoom factor. <br>The command to do this could be a function like <br>"GetEntityHandle" <br>Then we just need to know the structure of how each type of entity is stored in blitz, to get any offset value. <br>This kind of function would not be very difficult to write for someone with Mark's talent. <br><br>But while on the subject: Something I would really like to see added to blitz, is inline assembly ability. <br>That has access to the frontbuffer, backbuffer, imagebuffer, or a memory bank. <br>That would make blitz3D's capabilities truely endless. Hopefully using MASM32 coding style.  <br>Then if we need a new command, just write it.  Asm code could be shared with other users, and Blitz would begin to Evolve on its own.  AWSOME THOUGHT! <br>This is something all powerfull languages have. <br><br>And if not ever implimented in Blitz3D I hope it will be included in the next Blitz language. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
