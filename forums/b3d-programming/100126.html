What I have is a game that I wrote which was multiplayer. I've converted it to a single player game though the network code is all still part of the source, though not referenced anymore (I've removed references to the networking funcionality but the functions are still all there).  My thought (not a concern at all just a curiousity) was whether it would be possible for someone to take the final executable and reactivate the network code without having seen the source.<br><br>As I said it is more a hypothetical question - I'm curious whether a person could actually reactivate code that is no longer referenced.<br><br>To give some background, the reason I'm curious about this that I've noticed with monkey (not blitz3d) that if I write classes and functions that are not referenced anywhere they are not even included in the final source at all - and there is no error checking on those parts of the code when compiling which seems a very different way of compiling compared to blitz3d which will check for errors in code that is not actually referenced. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Executables don't export symbols, so there's simply no way to hook into functions the way you would with a DLL.<br><br>The long answer is that of course they could if they knew how to use a hex editor or decompiler... but in general I really, <i>really</i> don't think that's something you need to consider since logically once a person can do that, they can do literally anything anyway. (Besides, that sort of work is waaay beyond the ability of most mortals.)<br><br>So no, there is no reasonable way to do that.<br><br><br>That seems like an odd decision on the part of Monkey though. I can actually think of lots of reasons why I <i>would</i> want code to be compiled even if it's unused, mainly because checking that code compiles is the first stage of testing (and fun with static assertions is the second...). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
