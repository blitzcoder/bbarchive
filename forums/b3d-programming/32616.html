In fact the documentation just seems to make it more confusing than it would probably be if you just looked at the code.<br><br>The demos are really really nice, I'll give you that.  And it might be faster than my system was because it is single surface. But you've been able to do effects like these in Blitz for a while.  And single surface systems like this generally can't render 3D particles.  Those rocks are just sprites.<br><br>Oh, and there's a particle system called EOLE I think which is also single surface.  It's made by that french guy that did the nice GUI system.  That can pretty much do what this system can do.  And it's free.  And comes with an editor with a GUI which lets you save the parameters of a particular effect.<br><br>Of course feature for feature, maybe this system has some additional features which you'd find useful.  Hard to say without looking at the functions to see all the various parameters that are available.<br><br>But stunning effects like these are all a matter of using the right parameters, and the right art, and using multiple types of particles at once to create interesting variation. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If I do eventually create it, it'll be for fun, not because I expect to make much off it.  I suppose I could compete with these other system favorably if I made a really good editor and a lot of predefined effects, but it'd be tough to make my system stand out from the rest.  And I'd have to make a bunch of really impressive demos too to show it off like Particle Candy has.<br><br>My time would probably be better spent making a new terrain system or something.

I haven't seen yours mind you, but this is definitely easy to setup.  Just define an emitter (with parameters to define the particles it emits and how frequently to emit them,) then call UpdateParticles every frame; the include code handles everything else.  From using your shadow system I imagine your particle system worked the exact same way, but most of the particle systems I've seen are a darn sight more complicated. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
