Believe me PS2 is  a dino. I've spend 3 years of my life struggling with the stupid thing.

PS2 doesn't have pixel shaders unless they are software coded which is too CPU intensive in most instances, has too small an amount of Vram, so they use small textures, rarely more than 128x128 and more commonly 32x32 or 64x64 4 bit texturtes.

I'd say that Blitz could actually go beyond PS2 by quite a margin especially on the hardware we have today (mainly due to textures).  The problem comes down to the fact that there are only a few people working on titles ... with no dedicated 30 person art team you cannot match the titles you see on PS2 ... but this doesn't mean that Blitz is at fault or any of the tools really (with 3DS Pipeline and Blitz you're good to go).  <br><br>Also, many of the programmers here are just now really understanding the methodology to making everything efficient in Blitz.  The programmers doing PS2 work have years of experience already and also work in larger teams.  If you look at Aerial Antics it's very good looking ... and was mostly made in under 6 months.  I have to admit ... I didn't know as much then as I do now and our next game will really push Blitz and be a faster performing title. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's very, very low poly ( and the textures aren't huge either ) Add to that the fact that big city games have been around for ages now.
