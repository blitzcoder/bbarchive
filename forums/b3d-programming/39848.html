If you write something with it, and compile it, it still works ;)<br><br>Well, it's strange that some people bought a DX7 engine / programming language, and they expect it to be updated to DX8, DX9, etc. Some small game development studios work in a very different way: they first think about the game they want to make, then search for an appropiate engine (looking for its current features, instead of hoping that some of the thing it lacks will be added in a future update), buy it and stand with the version they bought, withut updating it (to ensure that nothing crashes with the update). This happens with some studios which use the Torque Engine. They got a stable version of the engine source code, and extend it themselves. That's what I am doing with the Cipher engine.<br><br>In Blitz, you cannot extend the source code to add new things, but in its current state, it's perfect to make shareware games. You don't have shaders in it, but a stable engine perfectly capable of creating a sell-able game, like it has been proven with dozens of published shareware titles :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I can see that there may be loads of different versions etc).<br>c) Wait an indefinite period of time before BR writes a native 3d module.

Pixel shaders does not a game make - besides, think of your target audience.  Do you have the manpower and resources available to you to take on the big AAA titles?  Even if you managed to get a AAA class title finished how would you get it sold?  It's nigh on impossible getting a major publishing house to recognise you and without heavy promotional funding you're never going to get the attention of the mass 'gamer lamer' market.  Having said all that, I must stress it's not impossible either, before a whole buncha people start yelling at me =] Still, there are a number of people who have done pretty damn well for themselves on their Blitz-made games.  The shareware mass are ripe for the picking and are generally more open minded, which basically means you can do quite well with something a bit less detailed but typically more interesting than your usual FPS romp - tho now you have to keep in mind that most shareware gamers have a considerably lower spec machine than your average gamer lamer.

B3D is based around an API that was released what... about 5 years ago? Darkbasic Pro on the other hand has all the eye candy features of DX9 and is updated on a continual basis. I like Blitz structure better and I think the IDE is much better IMHO and DBPro IS quirky but unlike Blitz3D, it not been virtually abandoned by it's devs. So if you are looking for a basic language that supports the latest DX9 stuff then you are pretty much wasting your time here and your needs may be better served by DBPro at this point in time. <br></div><br>Not everyone wants Blitz3D to use DX9, you know. DX9 is a waste of time for shareware developers. I would prefer it if B3D went down to DX6 or DX5, although I'm happy with DX7. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you like it great, but for me, Ill take stability over quirky anyday.   Id be really interested in knowing if most users of Blitz3D and DBPro really had any idea of what advantage, if any, that DirectX9 would bring to a game coded in either one?  Yea, yea, pixle shaders, thats all you ever hear about, but as far as I know, these would only be useful if your planning on releasing something a bit more, as someone else called it, AAA than 99.9% of the normal BB3D/DBpro community would be capable of delivering.<br><br>Lets face it, out of all the people who complain about this short coming in BB3D less than 1% of them would actually have a clue what to do with the added features.   I think for the masses, BB3D has far more to offer than most will ever use.  <br><br>Why don't you spend more time using what you have, and less time complaining about what you dont have and would probably never use?  If you did that we would have even more great games.  :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

"<br><br>just remember... the graphics and engine features are not the only difference between B3D and DBP.  i personally wouldn't mind DBP as much if the language itself were better.  as it stands, DBP's language is still very much like DB1 - the type support is minimal at best (and buggy in more complicated expressions), forcing you to rely on things like arrays and custom memblock data structures.  the way types are set up, there are no type pointers - so you can't pass types to functions byref, you can't make your own linked list, and the only way to "emulate" type pointers is by storing types in an array and using their indices - but then that becomes a problem when you start deleting random items from the array, invalidating those indices - so instead you have to have TWO arrays, one that is for the types, and one to keep track of which elements in ths first array (if any) are open.. just a really, really big pain in the ass that could be very easily avoided if they used type pointers instead.<br><br>additionally the resource index system is just as much a hindrance as the lack of type pointers - you WILL find yourself cursing when you have to work around those damned indices.  the funniest thing - many people who use DBP have functions like:<br><br><pre class=code>function GetFreeObject()
    for i=1 to 65535
        if object exist(i)=0 then exitfunction i
    next i
endfunction 0</pre><br><br>so that they can emulate the "handle" system blitz uses.  and yet they wouldn't dare change the index system.<br><br>aside from that.. the engine is pretty hot, but don't believe ALL the hype - BSPs still have bugs; the new advanced terrains still aren't as flexible as blitz terrains (can't modify them in real time?!); multitexturing (something that i take very much for granted in blitz) is only offered through a handful of underdocumented and restrictive commands; effects by their very nature don't always slot into the engine very well (and no animating models with effects.. boom); the inbuilt shadow shading is pretty crappy (on a lot of cards, the shadow is cast, rather jaggedly, onto the backfaces of the model that's casting the shadow); and the collision.... is nonexistent.  you need NGC to do ANY kind of worthwhile collision in DBP.<br><br>oh, and the EXE sizes get larger and larger with every release.  would you believe that the entire DBP runtime is over 11MB with the latest patch?  sure it's hard to get ALL the DLLs included, but the EXEs are averaging about 5 or 6MB minimum with this patch. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
