The program is relatively small and simple. Memory used for textures doesn't seem to affect the problem (or solution;).<br><br>I've got a deadline for next wednesday, so any help or tips GREATLY APPRECIATED!<br><br>My code is compiled in XP and run on a W2000 computer. Does that make a difference?<br><br>Once I've seen some 'system requirements' for Blitz3D - any idea where I can find them?<br><br>regards,<br>Desperate Danny.-- <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's true that their hardware might be considerably slower, but at least it works, is relatively quite, has a built-in port for frame grabbing hardware and support multiple hardware displays.
