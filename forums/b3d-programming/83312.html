Twice as slow? Twice as fast?<br><br>You know what? I think you can learn programming about as fast as anyone else if you are motivated. The problem (as I feel it as an observer) is that:<br><br>1.) You often don't wanna learn, just get it done. (get others to write the code if possible)<br>2.) You aim way to high for what your current skills allow, and you get frustrated when you don't reach results. Obviously you still have problems with basic matters like variable scoping and datatypes and by-reference vs. by-value, procedural programming etc. but still you wanna make "professional products" that sell.<br><br>This is a friendly community and you can learn a lot here but your not gonna learn very much if you continue like this:<br><br><div class="quote"> <br>...back the hell off. i am NOT having a bad day so that was a VERY BAD move to make.. <br> <br></div><br><br>If you take on small beginner projects (and maybe start posting beginner questions in the beginner area too) you will get successful results and you'll start to grow you knowledge to take on larger and more complex projects as you learn more. This will probably give you an feeling of accomplishment that is much worth to keep going on. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
