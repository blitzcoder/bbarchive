The Tokamak friction model works as I would expect it to - objects move from a grip to a slide progressively - the cars in SRX have a simple variable friction that decreases (under code control) as they are pushed harder into a turn or when unsing the handbrake or when braking/accelerating, so they start to slide at the desired times (dep. upon gameplay) and do so in a gentle and progressive manner. Once sliding, opposite lock steering on the front wheels is all that is required within the physics simulation to effect a full-on sideways slide and drift - the friction and physics system allows the slide to continue and remain controllable. If I want the cars to stick to the road better I simply up the base friction value. They can still slide at a certain point, but where that is I can decide. With ODE no matter what you do with the friction values the vehicles will simply spin out of control once they pass a certain point, or else they will flip over. In the past I have experimented with some pretty complex ODE setups including using multiple joints in place of the carwheel joint and also added counterweights under the vehicle to prevent it rolling, but the results are never even approaching satisfactory.<br><br><div class="quote"> I went out of my way to help you in the past, I even sent you a full copy of JV-ODE for you to experiment with remember? You tried for a few hours then threw in the towel, some 'serious' testing that was. <br></div><br>Well I tried the usual tests that I had used with my old ODE wrapper (involving hundreds of hours of work) and the results were identical, leading me to believe that nothing fundamental has changed within the physics / friction system. The typical ODE snap-spin and carwheel joint detachment/displacement problems remain, and without writing a very complex custom friction system (eg. using something like Pacejka - <a href="http://www.racer.nl/reference/pacejka.htm" target="_blank">http://www.racer.nl/reference/pacejka.htm</a> ) the car cannot be made to be controllable at speed.<br><br>However I'd love to be proven wrong, as all I'm interested in is messing around making programs with cars in.

I never managed to get ODE to allow you to control the slide - once it started the car always either spun on applying opposite lock caused an instant spin the other direction. It's a strange problem that, almost as if the mass of the main body is immaterial - it can be instantly spun the other way no matter how heavy it is, like it has no inertia....<br><br>I think the problems you say ODE has with wheels bouncing happens using Tokamak in SRX also - I have been experimenting with track polygon shapes on the more steeply banked corners to try and alleviate the tendancy for the front wheels to bounce upwards at the start of the banking, meaning you can easily bounce right off the track in a straight line rather than going around the corner. Using more polygons to make a smoother track doesn't seem to work for some reason, it seems that a lower poly track shape causes less bouncing, no idea why though. <br><br>I think I got it right, but I haven't done anything on SRX for a while now.

We managed to work around that too using double physics updates. one at high step (1.5) and one at low step (0.5) so that the second update would remove the problem (because the second step ran things at a lower pace.) This problem in ODE has been resolved (well, they've made it much less severe) in recent releases.<br><br>The problem with your bounciness is quite simple- If you have a spring and press on it rhythmicaly, the bounce will amplify.<br><br>As a car goes around a track, the spring is "pressed" each time it hits a different angle on a new polygon.<br><br>The reason it doesn't happen with lower poly tracks as much is because the angles don't change as often so the suspension gets to level out before it hits the next poly. If the suspension doesn't settle before it hits another poly, the bounce will probably amplify.<br><br>The way to solve the problem was using the spline technique I mentioned above. I can't remember the exact name of the technique,<br><br>You need to get the location of the wheel contact between the two polygons and interpolate. You basically get the % between left and right, and top/bottom of each poly, and retreive the collision point as it would be there, rather than using a raypick on the polygon.<br><br>You could fake this by aligning a quad to the two triangles and usnig THAT to collide with, though really you should use a more complex spline algorhythm to remove the problem completely.<br><br>I'm really not so good at explaining it, but I hope this at leask makes some sense! :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
