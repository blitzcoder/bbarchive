In fact the more I read it, the more I think many animators are really missing the entire point of poser and programs that do NICE animations. Here is a clip from that thread...<br><br>It really is much easier than all this guys.<br>1. create animation set in poser export to BVH<br>2. import BVH into Milkshape <br>3. model character and export to MS3D format<br>4. import into Character FX and attach the mesh to the bones.<br><br>Now, all of this makes good logic UNTIL number 3 and 4. Now please help me here - WHY WHY WHY WHY would any sane human want to redo what poser already jas done - ANIMATE!!!!!!!<br><br>I must be having a stupid attack, because do import a figure into milkshape or characterfx means you now have to screw around making a skeleton and attatching the damn mesh to the thing. Then after that tedious task, you still have to play for hours to get the BVH file to work right (if it EVER does).<br><br>Now why would ANYONE want to do this when the file is already perfectly animated right in poser. If curious labs had actually added a "EXPORT ANIMATED 3DS" oprion, I would have hundreds of animated and textured characters done before ANY expert could even make one simple low poly animation using this other method.<br><br>The converter I need would build keyframe data from the simgle meshes and save them as b3d or md2 or even 3ds.<br><br>With all of these great proggies like b3d (the king), dbasic, rad etc, it just melts my mind that this isn't the way it is done ALL THE TIME! No wonder why these freebie animated models are like gold - the amount of effort to make them look ok is amazing.<br><br>Even poser 2 could put to shame most of these models (even comercial ones) if it had a simple exporter.<br><br>I will not give up this quest until I can do this. In fact this is THE game to me now - forget the actual game I wanter to code!!<br><br>To everyone that thinks I'm crazy - get poser, load the low poly model, add some textures with uvmapper, than import some of the many free BVH motion files and see what you get - a great animated mesh.

It can only store solid meshes. The animation in 3ds format is created with simple position, rotation, and scaling of solid objects.<br><br>B3d does NOT store morph targets or any vertex animation data. That is to say the vertices don't get animated, the bones do (the vertices follow the bones). This means unless you can convert the bvh data into bones data there is no way to use b3d's. You then would need to attach the mesh to the bones and export that to a suitable format... sounds just like the milkshape idea posted above.<br><br>You do realise bvh doesn't store mesh data don't you?

The data for Vertex ownership (which bone controls which vertex) IS present in the 3ds format.  So is the rotation data per frame.

The rest of us are using CFX and Milkshap and doing our own animations.  From the animations I have seen from my modeller, they are nothing close to a "crayon" in detail. I am very amazed with his work.  You can use CFX if you want basic IK, and Milkshape has a great way of copying and pasting animations (to move the work along quickly).<br><br><div class="quote"> I have read every single post in this forum and many others, and I just can't believe I am the ONLY one that uses the amazing poser 5 and lifeforms studio to create animations.  <br></div><br><br>Did you ever wonder how the "big shot" companies of today achive this?  How is it that Halflife mod's get by with everyone using Milkshape?  Why hasnt anyone done any better?  Why does milkshape work for almost every game in existance?  Why you ask?  because its a basic tool, with tons of power.  The trick is complexity embedded in simplicity.  Did you ever sit back and think why poser makes such great animations?  well poser and such use very advanced vertex calculations per vertex, per bone, per bone parent, based on rotation limits, and calculating in weighting.  Try doing this in real-time, for 15 models, consisting of 1000 polys a piece, each having 18 bones.....<br><br>Remember, realtime, poser does this in a LOD-ish form in the editor, however when it renders out the finished goods, it takes quite a bit of time to calculate this.  10 frames of animation in poser (rendered quality), takes about 20 sec per every 1000 polys..  Its not quick to do those eyepopping animations.<br><br><br>I dont mean to critisize, but some of us have spent a bit longer searching then you on this topic and know you have to really hit ground floor before you waste too much time looking for a solution that never was.  Even if you were to convert those animation routines to b3d, they would look no better then my modellers IK animations.. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

MD2 is animated frame by frame, vertex by vertex. B3d only supports proper skeletal animation.
