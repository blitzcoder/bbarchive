I want it to have a hand drawn appearance kind of like Postal's backgrounds had or the Commandos games so a tilemap isn't appealing.<br><br>My concern is the massive amounts of memory these images will take up especially since each 800 x 600 "tile" will require a black and white collision image as well.<br><br>Am I worried about nothing?<br>How do these other games get away with such large background plates?<br>Should I load the background as tiles (ie. 50 x 50 or 800 x 600) or just load one big image?<br>Has anyone done anything like this in Blitz before?<br><br>Lastly, if I'm not mistaken, Postal was actually 3D characters over a 2D background.

So in that case, I would, at the very least, break it into screen-sized chunks.<br><br>You're not worrying about nothing, because Blitz doesn't offer any kind of texture compression and lots of big images will eat up your videoram pretty fast. If you can use tiles, I would highly recommend it. I would be tempted to use 3d for the whole thing, but perhaps just 2d-in-3d ( flat meshes ) for speed of rotation and scaling. It might make it easier to make your maps with tiles that way too.<br><br><br>And yes, the search function on this website is broken. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I say go for a single image, Cancerian. One thing NOT to do is try pasting an image larger than the the screen size to the screen buffer - use drawblockrect or drawimagerect (use blockrect in preference if u don't need a transparent bg) to draw an 800*600 portion of your image to the screen. I've had no problems doing this and it runs better than a tilemap engine.<br><br>Blitz plus would allow you to load your collision map into ram rather than vidmem which would give quicker collisions (I'm guessing) and allow you to save vidmem of course... but I guess from the forum u r using b3d.....<br>...... upgrade to bmax? ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I guess I will do a number of tests to come up with a good system that works on lower end computers.  My minimum spec is a PIII 500 with a 32MB video card.  Anyone with less than that isn't interested in playing games anyways (other than solitaire, I mean).<br><br>Do you think using a seperate black and white collision map is the best way to go for player to environment collisions?<br><br>I also wanted to have another graphics layer so that anything the player kills will remain on the background permanently.
