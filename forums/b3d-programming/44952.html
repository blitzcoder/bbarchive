That would be useful to know. Also an idea of the number of polygons he needs because that would definately alter my answer.<br><br>For low polygon count models OR breaking a huge model down into smaller parts I would use:<br><br>Gile[s]<br><br>Results are fantastic if you play with the settings and get to know the lighting well.  Nothing comes for free! :) <br><br>Products such as 3D Studio Max (which does fantastic rendered lighting) makes loads and loads and loads of extra textures when it lightmaps, so for real-time use it becomes to 'texture expensive'.<br><br>BUT beware Gile[s] may not load very large models! You should do some tests first, also medium sized models with loads of textures will be slow.  I have even known it to lock up completely under these circumstances.<br><br>B3d exclusively for B3d stuff.  Gile[s] copes with a great number of file formats, I know Fedbourg uses .ASE for some of his stuff, which may be useful for your CAD guy.<br><br>What is great about Gile[s] is how easy it is to break down a large model and assign a number of different lightmaps of varying sizes to each of your models.  If your friend needs a town lighting for example, you probably could not achieve that in Gile[s] (depending upon the polygon count and texture count), as one model...<br><br>...what you could do is break the town into smaller quadrants and light each of these separately.  Because you can load a lights set up and merge stuff, you can slowly lightmap each quadrant with the same lights in place, adding details where you need it and turning shadows off where you can't see them.<br><br><br>IPete2. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Last time I looked, it did the job, but would not lightmap imported non-cs created geometry (this might have changed by now)<br><br>There's various amateur freeware blitz produced LM's, but they all have problems.<br><br>Insight concepts was producing a LM called Luminescence3d which gave excellent results with minimal tweaking, however they seem to have discontinued development. <br><br>As for Giles, everyone raves about it, but I find it needs a lot of tweaking to get an acceptable render and it seems prone to artifacting when LM'ing my Lightwave generated geometry. I suspect this is because it likes nice regular output from editors such as Cart Shop, rather than the polygon soup from LW. However it does offer good control over group/surface LM settings and it's been wriiten with a view to Blitz integration. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The problesm with it is that you need a thorough understanding of the lighting tools and max render which is far more complex having been designed for pre rendered film and video production. <br><br>Also for best results you will have to play around with the mapping a fair ammount yourself in order to avoid thin black outlined on edges. <br><br>Also, to map large scenes efficiently in blitz, you are better off combining a series of models into one and mapping and lightmapping them together as a single entity and seperating it after as needed.<br><br>Works great, but is a lot of extra work that makes more sense to do at the end for final polish.<br><br>The beauty of giles lies in its simplicity of setup, and the fact that it car render a single ligtmap over a variety of seperate meshes without any fiddle that you would find elsewhere. It also does a better job of auto UVmapping, allthough I still find I prefer to arrange my maps by hand at the end of the day.<br><br>I love B3dpipeline, and find that adding more intermediate tools gets in the way of other parts of my workflow and level design. But if it wasn't for pipeline and 3dsmax, I'd see no alternative but Giles. <br><br>And I'd probably use Giles for simpler time critical tasks simply because of how quick and efficient it is, and easy for a newbie to learn without losing power for more advanced users. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
