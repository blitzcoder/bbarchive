Also by rotating or moving the texture you can add a level of dynamic effect to the object.<br><br>Simply fire explosions are often done with a cylinder which has a broad top and a smaller base, which is textured and then the top is stretched outwards and upwards whilst the texture is moved/rotated around the object.<br><br>The EntityAlpha is your friend for effects. When objects are less than totally solid (i.e. see-through, alpha'd) they give the impression of effect without the solid rigidity of geometry.<br><br>I'm not sure what you mean about the trajectory stuff but to move objects with an inertia value you would probably use MoveEntity, whereas if you wanted to move a mesh to an absolute position within 3D space you would use PositionEntity.<br><br>Hope something here helps. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If those rays all move relative to each other then it might just be a big sprite. If they move independently then they might be separate entities - cylinders maybe.<br><br>#2: Several concentric spheres texture mapped. I assume the spheres are animated in some way (growing/shrinking?) and probably the textures also.<br><br>#3: Looks like a couple of cylinders centered on the character. Same as #2 for animation.<br><br>#4: Not sure but the beam actually looks like a 2D sprite - though that would give you problems as the thing points more toward the camera. Looks like there's a very faint cylinder around the character too.<br><br>In general, as mentioned above, these effects all rely on choosing a set of simple (low poly) primitives and mapping them with some sort of decent effect texture (suitably alpha mapped). The primitives and textures can be animated to achieve the desired effect. Vertex and entity alpha can be animated as well.<br><br>Also, don't forget about particles. Combining a particle emitter with some of these glowing volumes can really extend the range of possible effects.<br><br>Hope that helps at all.<br>M <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
