It may prove to serve me well in a simulation I'm developing.<br><br>Before I push Blitz3d even more has anyone reached any limits or problems I may not be aware of? I know 3ds models have a vertex limit but no one should be using that format anyway.<br><br>The goal with my upcoming project is to simulate an entire planet in real time. Obviously the entire planet isn't rendered at once but is the only limiting factor the hardware Blitz is running on itself? I still need to crunch the numbers to figure how the exact size of the height map needed. In my design docs the planet is roughly 1/3 the size of the Earth so you will have a lot to explore.<br><br>I love the idea of a randomly generated planet but for now just filling a static world of that size is enough of a challenge. Any ideas of what my best approach would be? Should I split up the terrains into sections and only load them if the player is close enough to active them? Can Blitz3d support multiple terrains loading at once? I finally have a fair amount of art assets completed so I'm readying to start coding again.<br><br>My only complaint so far is my terrain doesn't look that great. Sculpting things manually I can make nice terrain in Maya and Mudbox but height map I generated (which I had high hopes for) doesn't look nearly as detailed as it should.<br><br>*image here*  Upload not working hold on. &gt;:(<br>If you want to try the height map for yourself you will need to convert it back to 1024x1024 and change the format.<br><br>Edit:<br>Okay so I tried 5 different uploading sites and nothing works.

This is what Rick shows by scaling the terrain width and depth by 8. But this is not acceptable for all kinds of games.

Previously I had all the calculations worked out with my former programing instructor but I lost the data when I shut off my Facebook page. Which won't be active again for quite some time.<br><br>The size of the planet went something like this:<br><br>Dimensions 	513.2×502.8×496.6<br>Mean radius 	252.1 ± 0.2 km (0.0395 Earths)<br><br>The original idea was to store a series of height-maps in a large array. The game then would randomize the placement of each onto the 3d grid of the actual world. I was manually designing each height map so they tiled or fit together with each other. The entire game world is not rendered at once so entities unseen to the player would also not be involved in collisions but still be moving. When I said "highly detailed terrain" I feel like it should look at least as good as Unreal 2. Scaling back the graphics a few eras behind what is considered modern should allow me to make a larger game.<br><br>I know you can have multiple height-maps but what about just one giant height-map that folders over onto itself? My graphics card has a limit of 8192 for texture size but has plenty of memory and processing power. Since Blitz3d runs only on one core I will need to optimize whatever I can. I doubt I will ever learn how to create multithreaded code.<br><br>Take a look at this game. It's terrible in every way but the concept is amazing:<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Combat" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Combat</a><br><br>Video:<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbgMxUd4_s0" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbgMxUd4_s0</a><br>In the real game it doesn't fade out when you break the atmosphere of a planet. Everything happens in real time.<br><br>Watch out because it comes with a nasty forum of Starforce or Securom hidden in it. So don't buy it unless you are cool with  removing things from your registry.<br><br>I haven't played any Derek Smart games in years because they are often extremely buggy and crash prone. Universal Combat like all his other games simulates entire universes, planets, and the terrain of each. Most of it is procedurally generated I'm sure but I know things can happen in the game whether or not you are present to see the event. Similar to how the original Radiant AI before it was removed from Oblivion functioned. I remember the devs kept finding every shop keeper dead. Basically the inhabitants of Oblivion after considering the easiest way to reach their goals found it easier to just kill for what they wanted. CREEPY!<br><br>Anyways what I really what for my game is a completely seamless experience. You never leave the 1st person perspective. The vastness of the terrain will help ensure the experience is unique each time you play. Basically you land on a planet with a mission and all the tools needed to survive. Ultimately success is up to you based upon your ability to command the team of terraformers.<br><br>I hoped that the placement of the enemy force could also be randomized. That way you may play the game for quite a awhile before encountering any hostilities. It could be a few hours of even a week before you discover any threats. This might be beneficial because you will be well established by then. When not in combat their will be plenty to do trust me. However keep in mind that the enemy has also had equal time to expand. The main focus of the game is to Terraform the planet but also defend it from any alien threat.<br><br><br>I found this information about the Elder Scrolls games:<br><br>Skyrim's heightmap is rectangular and uses 119 x 94 = 11186 in-game "cells". The engine uses the same cell size as in Oblivion, Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas - 57.6 metres (63 yards) to the side, 3317.76 m² (3 969 square yards) of area. The full map thus has an area of about 37.1 km² (14.3 square miles). Around a quarter of this is not playable, stuck behind invisible borders.<br><br>The playable area is roughly the same as the one in Morrowind and Oblivion and less than one thousandths of Daggerfall's size.<br><br>In addition, the game features a good part of the surrounding area of Tamriel as low-quality "fake" terrain meshes.<br><br>For comparison, the heightmaps of Skyrim (upper left corner), Morrowind (upper right corner) and Oblivion (lower left corner) look as follows, to scale (courtesy of Lightwave from Bethesda's forums). <br><br><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mPobe.jpg"><br><br><br>(THINK HERE HE IS TALKING ABOUT MORROWIND)	<br><br>According to the wiki, your running speed is 17.3 f/s. That means you run at about 11 mph. If the total area of the map was 14.3 miles, you'd be able to get from any point to any point in less than two game hours. You don't. It's a ten hour trip from Windhelm to Whiterun, for example. (Providing of course you play with the default time scale, of course)<br><br>If it were a real map, or everyone had the same size screen and resolution, it would be easy enough to eyeball the distance between the above mentioned cities, and call that 110 miles. Although your results may vary, I can guestimate that the longitudal distance of Skyrim is about 400-600 miles, and the latitudinal distance about 800-1000 miles. So, just as a rough estimate, the province would be somewhere between 320,000 miles, squared and 600,000 miles, squared.<br><br>For comparison, if we split it in the middle, Skyrim is about the size of Alaska. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This could work and allow to create larger world with larger terrains. However creating the seams between terrains could take more mstime in this case... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But it may be usable if a small region is precreated during the loading of the game. Especially if the generated terrain are low lod versions...
