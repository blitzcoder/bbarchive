So the request is pointless, because it's asking for a duplication of work that has already been done; and it's insulting, because it brushes aside dozens of man-years of work as somehow irrelevant <i>just</i> because they don't carry the Blitz3D branding.<br><br>Examples:<br> - <a href="/posts.php?topic=89612" target="_blank">SoftPixel Engine</a> (free)<br> - <a href="/posts.php?topic=90187" target="_blank">BlitzOgre3D</a> (free)<br> - <a href="http://xors3d.com/xors3d" target="_blank">Xors3D</a> (commercial)<br> - <a href="/posts.php?topic=84169" target="_blank">Ninfa3D</a> (free, late beta?)<br> - <a href="/topics.php?forum=119" target="_blank">miniB3D</a> (free, and has about half a dozen ports, one of which I am working on myself)<br> - <a href="https://github.com/nilium/max3d" target="_blank">Max3D</a> (free, incomplete)<br><br>...and those are just the ones that replicate Blitz3D's command set to a greater or lesser extent, so that you can port programs relatively quickly. You've also got much bigger and more powerful 3D engines like <a href="http://www.leadwerks.com/" target="_blank">Leadwerks</a> that have their own scene model based around shaders rather than entities. There are dozens of others.<br><br>And the other half is the language compiler itself. Well... in every way that they're different, Blitz3D is objectively inferior to BlitzMax, and I would say for the most part, to Monkey too. So the language side has been updated <i>twice</i>.<br><br>So essentially, everything you've asked for is already here, and in some cases has been for years. The reason I and others respond negatively to the question is because 1) you're essentially saying "Ah, young Sibly! You're not doing anything useful! Get over here and do some work!"; and 2) ignoring the fact that work has been done, just because it doesn't have the Blitz3D name and branding attached.<br><br>Now you may have other objections - what about quality? What about ease-of-use? <i>They're not Blitz, dagnabbit!</i><br><br>Well, Xors3D and Leadwerks are both commercial projects spanning several years, so they have excellent support, and both have put games on Steam. I don't have access to any numbers, but I think Leadwerks may even be bigger than Blitz by user base.<br><br>If ease-of-use or "not Blitz" really is your concern... I hate to be so blunt but - suck it up and learn. If you want to take the big leap to triple-A engines, you need to learn to love technology, and to feel at home while moving forward on the crest of the wave. Adding an engine to a compiler via .decls, or .defs, or whatever mechanisms any other languages use, really isn't anywhere near as hard as writing a game. And if branding issues ("not Blitz!") are really getting in your way of using an otherwise stable, powerful and easy engine, you should note that this is diametrically opposed to the principle of choosing the best tool for the job, trying to stay ahead of technology, and minimizing work in favour of automation that really defines the world of programming.<br><br>Finally, you might want to consider what happened to the Max3D project (probably the closest BRL has or will come to a true "Blitz3D 2"). Mark spent four or five <i>years</i> working on that engine, and the result was pretty much that it had to be abandoned because it couldn't compete with other engines that were already complete (and had swallowed up all of the Blitz users who had been waiting for Max3D in the meantime, so nobody was interested).<br><br>I hope this helps you understand the hostility to an idea that, as we have said, has been discussed many, many times, to death and beyond.<br><br>Incidentally, I'm a huge fan of Blitz3D too (in case that wasn't clear). I just have the opinion that its time for use on high-performance, glittery projects is long past, rather than trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. If you won't seek out new technology to fit your needs, rather than pick one piece of obsolete technology and declare that against all logic it somehow <i>will</i> fit your needs, you should be prepared to fail (and frankly, would deserve to fail).<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Let's start again... welcome!<br><br>If all you want is 2D... while BlitzMax might have been the better purchase, Blitz3D is actually still pretty competitive, as most of the problems with performance and so on are less important in a 2D game. So you should be fine for that.<br><br>Two libraries that may help you:<br> - <a href="/posts.php?topic=78304" target="_blank">Draw3D</a><br> - <a href="/posts.php?topic=92270" target="_blank">Draw3D 2</a><br><br>They're by the same person, but they're not that similar so it's worth listing both (the first is smaller and simpler).<br><br>Anyway, these use 3D quads as images and drawing primitves, letting you get superfast alpha, rotation and scaling effects in 2D, which the native 2D engine can't do. As long as you don't need operations on individual pixels, they're much, much faster than the built-in 2D engine. <br><br>Several examples are included, but all you really have to do to get started is Include the main file. Both versions also include a simple 2D physics engine and a rudimentary GUI. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
