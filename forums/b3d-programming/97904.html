I will also need to have something that can somehow add more features like shadows and particle effects. Are there any recommendations? Dynamic Linked Libraries, External Libraries via 'bb' files. <b>*Must have a good Documentation*</b> Does anyone recommend the FastExtension or FastImage? Is there anything better/faster for low spec machines? not a necessary but a nice gui with a more professional appearance would be nice. :D<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Otherwise... it's already as fast as it can reasonably be made (and who even has that amount of media?). Libraries will not help with this in any significant way.<br><br><br><div class="quote"> Does anyone recommend the FastExtension or FastImage? <br></div><br><br>Yes. These are the absolute best B3D libraries that still use the original engine core.<br><br><br><div class="quote"> Is there anything better/faster for low spec machines? <br></div><br><br>...if B3D+FastExtension isn't low-spec enough, the machine in question will not play anything worthwhile anyway. As an aside, a general guideline is to not target low-spec anyway: it's better to create a good game that will be enjoyed by most players, than a game that low-end players can play, but won't like, and nobody else will play at all. (PS: Your ancient eBay laptop is <i>not</i> "low"-spec; it's waaaay off the bottom of the scale, and there is no reason whatsoever to even think about supporting it.)<br><br><br><div class="quote"> a nice gui with a more professional appearance would be nice <br></div><br><br>...need to know what you want to build to know what kind of GUI is good for you.<br><br><br><br>Now, a question in return:<br><br><div class="quote"> I am going to be starting work on a huge project with Blitz3D <br></div><br><br>...what? Why?<br><br>You have BlitzMax; you've been focusing on learning BlitzMax instead of Blitz3D; you understand that there are other 3D engines out there, and that the B3D engine has very few advantages these days (and very limited compatibility). Why are you actively choosing to downgrade both language and engine before beginning a "huge project"? (Especially since your request indicates that you already feel B3D isn't even appropriate for a "huge project" out-of-the-box?)<br><br>Seriously, I love B3D too, but for beginning a new "serious" project, if you <i>have</i> BlitzMax + a modern 3D engine I can't fathom why you wouldn't use them. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I will repeat my earlier comment: you can get a much newer device like an eeePC for the same sort of price as the replacement screen alone! ...I guess it's your money to burn, but be warned that you almost certainly won't be able to change the graphics card in a laptop (so do research this properly).<br><br><br>Back to the topic -<br><br>My personal recommendation would be for Irrlicht, because that's what I'm migrating to myself! (Don't ask me any questions about it yet though. Still new.)<br><br>Irrlicht does contain a GUI. Surely for a video game, the "business-style" Devil engine GUI is not what you want? Most games have very chunky, simple interfaces that don't look anything like application GUIs. All you normally want is a panel-based 2D engine that can detect inputs and roll the rest, especially the appearance, yourself (I think Irrlicht's GUI will handle this OK).<br><br><div class="quote"> Which is better? MaxB3d, MiniB3d, Warner, OGRE? <br></div><br><br>Don't know MaxB3D or Warner Engine, but of the other two: miniB3D is a "simple" engine, and doesn't handle high-demand stuff that well (it does too much maths in BlitzMax, and animates with the CPU); OGRE is a rendering-only solution and may be a little short on other features that you would want, but is likely to be much faster than the others (similar to Irrlicht, I expect).<br><br><br><div class="quote"> What engine can handle hundreds of *high poly* models? <br></div><br><br>Anything that does most of the maths in C/++ and the animation on the GPU...<br><br>You will need to give proper thought to LOD systems, geometry instancing, and level design, to make any highly-detailed game perform well, unless you use an engine that has those features built-in, but that will necessarily also mean a loss of control.<br><br>Super Gerball and Mario Kart don't really sound like they need that level of detail though (Super Gerball is the original miniB3D game, isn't it?).<br><br>The short answer is: pick one technology and learn it thoroughly. Upon seeing your goal, it is probably something you could do in B3D, but just choose one thing and develop with that. Of the tools available GMan's Irrlicht port looks like the best option to me, because it combines massive power with a familiar Blitz product, but really any of the ones you mentioned will do fine as long as you persist with them. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Any model with more than IIRC 64K vertices will probably cause things to crash and in some cases you can hit the limits earlier than that. IIRC there are also fairly restrictive overall scene limits. Aslong as you use some good opptimisation tho its possible to use some decently high resolution meshes.<br><br>There is no one ideal realtime dynamic shadow casting system for B3D, fastext does well for certain types of useage but is quite limited, devils shadow system does proper stencil shadows but has some compatibility issues and if your producing a commercial app may run into some patent issues as some of the techniques it uses are based on IP owned by creative technology.<br><br>From the sounds of what your trying to do you probably should be either looking at the Leadwerks Engine or possibly HeroEngine. What your trying to do is possible in B3D but only with a lot of experience and preparedness to think outside the box. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
