I have fairly knowledge of building compilers and engines so this wouldn't be a matter of how but more a matter of how long it will take.<br><br>I'd love to use such a language for my own projects but there are still some questions I'd like to discuss:<br><br>1) How important would cross platform be? I mean I'd choose OpenGL for rendering anyway but cross compiling itself can be a pain in the ass. Would it be ok to do Windows only first with the option to add Mac and Linux later? Or would you prefer DX9+ and concentrating on one platform? Any reasons why I should prefer DX over OpenGL?<br><br>2) I'd choose the original command set including a simple IDE so that existing code should work without changes. My main concern here is: Am I allowed to create a 1:1 copy of the command set? Of course I won't use anything from the original BB3D stuff!<br><br>3) Before doing such a task is there really a demand for this?<br><br>Oh and I need a good name for that baby! :)<br><br>Thanks for your answers!<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You don't need to bother with this if you're going with C code. Lex, YACC etc. shouldn't really be affected by platform as they're totally portable, and are only for the front-end as far as I know, so you'd use them together with it (or not, depends what you want to do).<br><br>If you are using C code as your output though, here's a nice thing that will help a LOT: <a href="http://bellard.org/tcc/" target="_blank">http://bellard.org/tcc/</a><br><br>It's a super-fast, super-small C compiler (under 1MB!). Handles standard C89 and C99. It also allows you to create-and-run in memory without saving an exe file to disk, same as the B3D compiler, so you might find it handy to use this as a built-in backend to replicate the original B3D's very fast compile times and Run button. (However, it doesn't do <i>any</i> optimization, which lets the compiler be very fast at the cost of slower output code.)<br><br>If you're a Schemer, I also have a miniature parser framework similar to Spirit, that may interest you (I've been trying to work out if I can port it to BlitzMax, but I don't think it will go).<br><br><br><div class="quote"> The Flip command for instance doesn't make sense in OpenGL...  <br></div><br><br>Really? miniB3D has a Flip command - in fact I think it uses the BlitzMax builtin Flip.

</textarea><br><br>I make no guarantee that I remembered everything. There are probably several errors. (<b>EDIT:</b> Yeah, caught a few already.)<br><br>Some things that could arguably be considered syntax aren't included - "Include" isn't there because it's handled in a separate step (I'd have done it before the parse step, myself); the fact that some expressions have to be constant isn't there (because that's really a semantic issue), and the fact that function parameters need to be ordered (i.e. you can't have an optional parameter, than a non-optional one) is ignored, because it's easier to handle it later (and most grammars ignore this - notably C++ and Python).<br><br>The notation isn't EBNF, but it should be clear enough if you do know any proper system or YACC (I can't be bothered to write out the extra operators). I also haven't bothered to define the terminals properly, on the assumption that those are handled in a separate lexer step.<br><br>In doing this I discovered Blitz3D actually allows you to do some really odd things in terms of stacking commands onto one line, so the fact that separators aren't defined through most of that is correct - they really are optional ion most places. For some reason the colon doesn't work as a separator in Type definitions though, only newline.<br><br>I'm sorely tempted to go the rest of the way (and plugging it into a parser framework wouldn't take long)... but I have work to do (sigh)...<br><br><br>@Dark Soul:<br><br>You might have more fun if you try looking at higher-level (erm... "modern") languages instead of extreme low-level stuff like that. e.g. Python, Ruby, Scheme, Java...

There are <i>far</i> more expressive languages out there (and this <i>is</i> something that can be measured objectively), and if you did try them and decide Blitz3D was more logically expressive, it means you were doing it wrong (go and read <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/" target="_blank">this</a>, then come back after your mind is blown). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Now that made me laugh. Honestly, you Blitzmax people sure are a funny lot. Anyway, if you seen the end of my Statement I laughed (LoL). I know a lot of young programmers also have the ability to form programs from the syntax of their choice. I was 18 back in the late 80s when I taugh myself how to program. Oh and Action for the Atari was a lot like C. Should have known I'd pick up a few that didnt understand one part of what i was saying, but thats Ok, and when I said Almost every language, I meant the main ones most people use, even tried my hand at Java, and the Android SDK to see what all the cell phone rage was about. Till I started checking cell phone sites and seeing Parker Brothers and the rest of the big companies were in play now and its way harder to get a cell phone game noticed. And no, I'm not a systems programmer. I write games. And by the way, C compiles out to Assembler so its also fair to say that it is a subset of 80386 machine language and anything done in C can also be done Assembler. But its gonna a lot freaking harder than either C or Blitz. If I wanted, I could program a Game in C, but unless I'm doing the next World of Warcraft or Halo I see no need to put myself through all that. So you all can have your opinions and I'll have mine. I was just trying to put a plug in for all those poor saps that miss Blitzbasic and want a new Blitzbasic that can rock Win7s world. As I also stated, I moved to Purebasic a while back because it works on win 7. Not as sexy as Blitzbasic and not as fast as Blitzmax, but its fast enough for what I need. I hope none of this offended any of you because the last thing I'd wanna do is piss off a bunch of people I dont know and could care less about, so as I bid you fairwell I'll leave you with this.
