The answer to that is no.<br><br>There may be some really complicated ways of getting an effect like that, but they'd also probably be much too slow to use.  What I suggested was a complicated way to do it if all your lights are static that would be fast.<br><br>But I don't see any use for this sort of effect unless it actually speeds the game up.  Unless you want it as some sort of special effect that looks cool, but I don't see a low res texture in dark areas looking very cool.  I could see other types of texture effect in dark areas working out in interesting ways though.<br><br>If I really wanted to do an effect like this and it had to work with realtime lights, I think the only way you could do it in Blitz would be by lighting the level without textures and using the lit level for alpha and then using that somehow to blend two copies of the level together, one with high res textures and one with low res textures.  If you could do that it would require some creative setting of different texture blending modes, as well as setting up the camera or even all the objects in the game in a special way, like using the alpha flag, or clearing the color buffer on the camera but not the zbuffer.  <br><br>What I'm saying is even if you could accomplish this effect in Blitz, it would be very hard to set up.  Not a simple function call or two.  And there would be no speed benefit, and probably a major speed hit.  And visually, I don't think it would be interesting enough of an effect anyway to go to all that trouble, but I guess that'd be your call. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Model texture resolution is the same no matter if the model is in light or shadow - but usually lightmaps cover bigget area and are thus lower in resolution... blocky lightmap on top of the detailed mesh texture may seem like that the mesh texture is lower rezz too (which it isn't). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

No.  Could you make a function to do it?  Yes.  Would it be easy to do so?  No.<br><br>What you would need to do is: <br><br>Precalculate an inverted version of your lightmaps.  Ie, Black = White.<br><br>Copy all the surfaces in your mesh so you have two of every surface and every polygon at the same location.<br><br>Texture the first set of surfaces with the low res texture the normal lightmap, and the inverted lightmap.<br><br>Texture the second set of surfaces with the high res texture, the normal lightmap, and the normal lightmap again.<br><br>You could set the first lightmap in each of these stages to x2 multiply blend if you want that effect.  The second lightmap in each stage acts as an alpha map.<br><br>Finally, set the blending mode of the second set of surfaces to add blend.<br><br><br>What's going on here?  The inverted light (alpha) map blots out any of the first surface that you want hidden.  Namely, anything in the light areas.  The normal light (alpha) map blots out anything in the second surface which is in dark areas.  You then add the two together and the result is seeing the bits you want to see in each area.<br><br>Fairly complicated to set up, but possible. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
