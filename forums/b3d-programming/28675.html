"Fort Ciskin".  Make sure you are in <br>Hardware mode. As I wandered around I felt like I was actually in a real forest of Ontario, Canada.  <br>Also watching the Dinasours actually breathing, was very <br>impressive.  Find a Bronto. near the waters edge and you <br>can walk right up to it and look at it real close.  <br><br>Anyway, I wanted to write a program with simular outdoor scenery.  Once that phase is done and working as fast as <br>Blitz can do it. Then that base can be used for any outdoor <br>type game.  I noticed that as you get a certain distance <br>away from a tree, it suddenly changes slightly in <br>appearence.  So I figure they used a low poly image as you <br>get a certain distance away.  I am hoping that Blitz3D can <br>match the speed of that game. <br><br>If anyone is interested in helping in the challange, please <br>join this forum topic. And perhaps togeather we can come up <br>with something impressive. <br>And we can all learn something along the way. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Easy to do in a forest since the visual range is low). Once the player gets closer to an object swap with a higher poly mesh. The landscape meshes do this LOD (level of detail) well.

Also has an array <br>of Sounds as well as Density, which corrisponds with the <br>tiles. So as you walk around you here different footsteps, <br>according to the tile you are on.  And Density means water <br>tiles will have you sink. That system alows you to make <br>any type of terrain cause you to sink. <br>It uses another array for the hight of each vector joining <br>the tiles, to create the highth of the terrain.<br>How to impliment this in Blitz3d is a good question. <br> The Carnivore Demo can be downloaded from LINK: <br><a href="http://www.gamerankings.com/itemrankings/launchreview.asp?reviewid=175347" target="_blank">http://www.gamerankings.com/itemrankings/launchreview.asp?reviewid=175347</a>  <br>The Area1.map file can be edited with a hex editor. <br>I use Carnivores 1 and 2 so much because they are good <br>examples.  If anyone knows of another good outdoor type <br>game with exceptional and fast graphics please let me know. <br>Carnivores 1 and 2 were fast and smooth on my 350 MHz Amd K6 machine <br>with 4 Megs of video, that's what impressed me.

LOD triggers can be built fairly simple in blitz3d. Myself, I use the node triggers to launch a group of trees into action. The problem with your routine and with Autofadeentity when using 10,000+ trees is; the logic has to be preformed on each entity per cpu cycle or logic render. Ouch! that can kill a game quickly.<br><br>By linking your trees to triggers (or some call them portals), you can skip the cycle time needed to filter through all your tree entites tring to detemrine autofade values and hiden/visible data. You preform these operations on the portals instead then if something needs changed you branch off to the objects linked to the portals.<br><br>Using that approach I managed over 12,000 trees on this map and kept the frame rates extermely high. <a href="http://www.aliencodec.com/products/treemagik_pro/screenshot_4.html" target="_blank">http://www.aliencodec.com/products/treemagik_pro/screenshot_4.html</a><br><br>Check out some of my tree shots here <a href="http://www.aliencodec.com/products/treemagik_pro/tmpro_screens.html" target="_blank">http://www.aliencodec.com/products/treemagik_pro/tmpro_screens.html</a><br><br>Now of course theres other ways of doing this, and I will be the first to tell ya to explore the possibilites..
