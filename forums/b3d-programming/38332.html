(this is what i designed it for)<br><br>Now, it has a couple of issues... like, Lightmapping doesnt work with it. but normal meshes seem to work fine. Of course, Lightmapping is quite widely used, so itd be great to see if someone fixes the issue. The other issue is that with very large meshes, theres a slight delay when the mesh is rebuilt. Thats why it should not be used totally realtime, but say, once a second, or when a player reaches the edge of the loaded section<br><br><br>Well, what do you lot think of the idea? its pretty much complete, just sitting at home waiting for me to plop up here for y'all! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

One of the things im noticing is that sometimes when you remake the mesh the creating of the vertices and triangles seems to take a huge amount of time. memory bottleneck or something? i dont know.<br><br><br>What would be nice is if we all got together and created a good "realtime" occlusion system for blitz. Alot of us here have some great ideas! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

No matter where I look.<br><br>With oct-trees, The fps runs at an average of 200fps.<br>Even higher depending on where I look.<br><br>Now, as I add to this level, the first method will get slower and slower..but as long as I use oct-trees, the fps is consistantly nearly 2x as fast.<br><br>In short(Well too late for that), it's proving vital..<br><br>And the oct-nodes hug the mesh beautiful, however abstract and big/small it is.(Size is irrevelent.The oct-tree complexity stays the same)<br><br>You can even set say, a 5000 poly theashold. if a area/node has more than that, it subdevides it further. so in lower poly areas there's far less oct-treeing..again making everything consistant and much much better than any hand placement job could hope to be.(and it only takes 5 seconds to do a 50,000 poly level on a p800.) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
