It's those libraries and contributions that have kept the ship afloat and exciting.<br><br>So if you've reached the point you get serious about wishing for physics, fancy lighting &amp; shading, proper audio, post effects, etc. then I think very carefully consider your stategy and the amount of time you might be willing to invest in your next project; for example how long does it take you to make something serious and will people still be able to install and run it by the time you're finished with it! ;)<br><br>SORRY my dear fellows if it sounds like I'm ranting here, like I said I love Blitz and had great times these past years - even made some serious bucks with it and have part of my carreer to thank for it - but I reached the point that if I want to survive, I gotta move on and invest in tomorrow in stead of praying for a bug fix for yesterday's problems..<br><br>So yeah: Replacing the DX7 core with DX11 is on top of my wish list ;)<br><br>Peace &amp; Love!<br><br>Danny<br>p.s.

Hurries up with a properly working, full featured 3D Engine for BlitzMax (be it OpenGL or DX9/10) so that existing B3D users can upgrade and not only enjoy graphics features that have been common these past many years(!!) - but can also enjoy the additional and more advanced language features BMax has to offer. Enabling existing users to design and build future-proof games &amp; applications.<br><br>If Blitz Research does not provide a solution for future development then users have no choice but to look for an alternative engine &amp; development environment. There's plenty other 3D engines and whatnot's available these days.<br><br>I'm no advanced top-notch developer. But I have been programming all my life and have grown way too big for B3D in that I can no longer develop or commercialize my ideas, simply because I can not trust B3D to work anymore on today's machines &amp; operating systems...

I don't understand why anyone would want B3D to be further developed when BlitzMax is the next incarnation of the language.<br><br>It's essentially the same as Blitz3D when you use miniB3D but offers choices in regards to 3D engines that you attach to it (Ogre, Leadworks, etc).  It also has more advanced language features you *can* use if you wish, or you can just stick to the more simple language structure; however, it offers more advanced coding techniques for those who want to improve their programming.  In 2D it offers real-time scaling, rotation, blending etc.  You can choose DX7, DX9, or OpenGL.  I guess I just don't understand why someone would say "I would gladly buy Blitz3D all over again if it was updated" when it has been reincarnated as BlitzMax.  For those who want it updated because they don't want to buy the new version, well, thats understandable... but all good things come to an end.  The product still does what it did when you bought it, and is still being improved by the community...<br><br>I imagine the reason B3D hasn't been "updated" is that it was based on DX7 which didn't use 3D to create 2D, so the whole system would probably have to be re-written...

Other products look and deliver like 'professional packages.' Not saying they're better- just saying 'look at their websites.' DarkBasic, Torque- even Realmcrafter's website has more than 1 short page of hype per product, and loads of add-ons/content. <br><br>And so many place to get access to source it's not even funny- free and commercial. In this day and age of a thousand engines- it's tragic blitz is going to end this way.<br><br>But a tiny little 'fix this'/'break that' invigoration every 4-6 months (if you're lucky) won't change it.<br><br>Blitz3d is dead.<br><br>I'd love to be proven wrong- but seriously- at this point anything short of adding pointers and exposing internals will just be maintaining the 'status quo' which (to me) is- 'hands off the goodies'. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It does look good, though- nice screenshots. I wish you well on your project- and I'm glad that blitz is enough for your needs- but that doesn't change things for a lot of us. <br><br>I can tell by your work you're a 'mad programmer'. Everyone isn't like you. Don't judge the language by your ability to kludge the hell out of it till you get results. Don't stop- please- you're helping magnificently! But know full well that the average programmer may not get 'Flip False' vs 'Flip True'- more or less write a lib to allow threading because he wants it. Hell, write a pointers lib.<br><br>Look, Blitz3d (2001) is 8 years old at this point- which alone is reason to consider it obsolete software in some circles. But Mark shipped BlitzPlus in 2003, and BlitzMax in 2004- which shows he has time to code new products, as well as limited support.<br><br>Anyway. Pretty scenes don't bridge the ever-expanding technology gap. You want to write shaders? Get ready to kludge like hell and reinvent the wheel or shell out some cash. A lot of coders have done for blitz amazing things- but soon as you show me something comparable to Xors/Fastlibs, but gives the source as well (Even Devil's tools (kudos, btw) don't give the DLL source), I'll give you a point. And how long must users beg before they get support? Hell, how long ago was Ashadow? Mark saw that and immediately said <br><br>"Wow, that's nice- I bet my customers would like that..." <br><br>BZzzzt!<br><br>Don't get me wrong- everyone wants to get paid for their time and hard work- I don't blame them. But as a blitz owner you end up having to pay over and over again for features that are FREE to any other proper DLL-handling language user- or worse, part of one of the minimally accessible Windows APIs. Minimally accessible because Blitz won't let you properly 'play'. No pointers or callback means you sometimes have to pay someone who 'wants to get his due' for a wrapper to a FREE library! Free to any 'real' language. Programmers are not liberated- they are shackled- unless you learn everything and do it yourself. What good is a language where everyone must do it all themself- or always be paying for add-ons- when there's free, unusable dlls all over?<br><br>Don't get me wrong. I like Blitz3d- a lot. But face facts, the list of what you can do is impressive- but the list of what you can't do unless Mark helps out is oppressive. At this point it is way easier to put blitz features into another language than it is to make blitz 'progress-worthy'. No one but Mark can put pointers in- and if they did, they'd prob break at the next update. Mark could do it right. He chooses not to. Not part of his coding 'philosophy' I guess. Not for Blitz3d anyway.<br><br>But everyone else wants them. Too bad. Deny it all you want, but Blitz is on 3rd Party life support- has been for years. I paid for Fastlibs- a brilliant product from a brilliant coder. I wasted money on Realmcrafter (don't ask). I almost bought Xors, till I decided to go the OpenGl path. Now, after fighting with useless BSP loading and even more sad- pitiful animated mesh handling (animated meshes don't update geometry info) I'm ready to chuck it.<br><br>You can only go so far as a coder in blitz- unless you like living inside the box, or doing mad work to unbox it. I salute you mad workers. But sad to say, Mark isn't one of them anymore. So Blitz, 'patchwork 3rd party, upgraded- every now &amp; then'- will never be as good as it could be if Mark showed more than passing interest in supporting it. Hell- even for his new son, "BlitxMax" he's given up on the 'official' 3D library 'Max3d?'- the sounding trumpet that spurred many into buying the language. Yeah- I know- plenty of 3d libraries to choose from. They were there before he decided to announce that 'eventually to be broken' promise. But if he can't follow through on features for his favorite son, what really can the 'forgotten child' expect?<br><br>You'll get more updates. Bugfixes. A feature here. There. Forever. Or till Blitz3d is so outclassed/useless that it's obvious to let go.<br><br>"Get the paddles. Clear. Shock him. We got a pulse, but it's weak... Good enough."<br><br>But no matter- you'll still be DX7 limited, with no pointers or proper access to internal data structures. Your BSP and animated mesh support, collisions- will be nothing more than kludgy shadow puppetry, and there's only so much brilliant coding that can be done before you might as well start anew. Or follow someone else's path- using Xors, the bloody clever SoftPixel3d, or some other rendering engine- using Blitz as a virtual 'glue' for accessing it's features and moving forward.<br><br>Yup- Blitz3d is dead. A dead horse actually. A dead horse that's now good for glue?<br><br>I hope not. But I guess I should stop beating it, eh?<br><br>My 'angle' (if you want to call it that) isn't that Blitz3d _needs_ to be dead- it's that it seems it _wants_ to be dead! I mean- at least let the users do it themselves!<br><br>   * Add pointers<br>   *implement callback, threading (yeah- I know- 3rd party- but official is good)<br>   * make system vars for internals. Let us break shit if we want!<br>   * Make a reserved words 2x, once with an underscore trailing (Renderworld, Renderworld_) Anyone who's tried to add functionality, but retain backward compatability can see how this would help.<br>   * give geometry access to Load BSP &amp; Load(animated whatever)<br>   * Zbuffer access, etc.<br><br>I think the first 4 would be enough for coders to do most things they'd want. God forbid the language grow and mature.<br><br>But without those, It's a lot of hard work- if it can be done at all. I guess better to say 'if it's worth doing in Blitz3d vs starting anew elsewhere.'<br><br>So. Not my call. Mark's call. But 8 years without pointers seems pretty stubborn to me. I think it's been decided. No matter who wants it- why they want it, or how useful it would be to have them, Mark refuses the 'transplant'. No transfusion. An apple sits on the table but the patient's mouth is taped shut.<br><br>Eventually, the patient dies.<br><br>You call it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
