I'm not sure what it was supposed to say. Something like "MMO engines and stuff".</i><br><br>I was going to have a tinker with ckob's open source MMORPG engine, just for the hell of it, really. I've not got any particular plans to write one, I don't have the time, I'm just curious to pick and poke at the code and see an example of how one would be written. Unfortunately, I don't have any version of BlitzPlay to try it out, so I was wondering (to ckob or anyone who knows, really):<br><br>-Are there any other Open Source MMORPG engines out there?<br>-Does ckob's engine need any work to function with an up-to-date version of BlitzPlay Pro, assuming I purchased it, which I might well do because it looks cool? I notice the requirements for for v1.1, but it's past v2 now.<br>-What sort of state is the ckob engine in? Is it a basic client-server model? Does it have code in place for NPCs, quests, dialogue etc.? Not that I mind adding it, I'm just curious.<br><br>Sorry for all the questions, it's just BlitzPlay Pro is of no use to me at the moment, since I'm spending most of my time working on a single player project anyway. And my next project is also going to be single player. But I would consider buying it sooner rather than later if I had something appropriate to play about with. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you have any more questions about it please feel free to email me @ ckob@... or just ask here ill keep checking.  If your thinking about buying blitzplay pro do it I think it was probebly one of the best purchases for blitz I ever made.<br><br>You might also want to check out www.mmorpgce.com it's not free but it sounds to be promising.  I use to own mmorpgce until I sold it to solstar because I alone couldnt handle the amount of work that was needed as I was busy in real life as well.  The new company that owns it is pretty professional about how they do things and from what I have seen the engine is gonna be good. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Turned out, it was mostly addressed to you :D<br><br>Well, thanks for the input. I quite relish the idea of adding in NPCs and stuff, but I'm a bit wary about updating BlitzPlay, since I've never really used it. Guess it wouldn't hurt to try.<br><br>MMORPGCE looked pretty neat, I thought, I wouldnt mind paying for it (well, depending on the price, I guess) because it sounds particularly well-made.<br><br>Well, thanks for the reply, ckob, I may well make that BlitzPlay purchase. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
