Not only is it easy to get at the media files of most PC games, in most cases players are actively encouraged to do so.  Why?  Because game companies have found that fostering communities surrounding their game (for mods, etc.) attracts a LOT of players.<br><br>Furthermore, what difference does it make if someone uses your art assets in their game?  That is of course illegal but what difference does it make to YOU?  Except for really unique art (in which case the theft is so blatantly obvious you could probably win without any lawyer at all) their use of your art assets does not hurt the sales of your game.<br><br>Morover, there is no significant chance of theft even when files are temporarily being decrypted to the hard drive.  It is much more likely that a hacker will crack your game and distribute a warez version.  Done correctly (eg. terabit's DataPak) the file will only ever exist for a couple milliseconds; the horrible thieves you envision would have to know down to a fraction of a second when to grab your files, and then they would have to know where to look (since you can write to any old temp directory you want.)  If someone is skilled enough to figure out that level of protection they would have no trouble grabbing the data from the memory bank you are proposing.<br><br>**********<br><br>I saw a recent thread about a publishing company failing to pay the developer for their game's royalties but have never heard of a publisher stealing specific game assets.

(Though from reading these boards there seem to be enough 3D programmers who understand what they are doing enough to do this on a 3D game.)<br><br>Simple Example: Make a copy of Mario Bros. side-scroller type game with the character graphics and background tiles replaced. If you looked at each graphic in a separate file (as Blitz intends you to put them) it would be fairly easy to redraw each differently while still having the graphic work exactly the same in the game (a floor piece would still be a floor, just drawn differently). Now you'd have a new game for the effort of redrawing some sprites -- and it would not be very obvious that the program itself was swiped.<br>Simpler Example: Replace the checker, checkerboard, and title screen graphics from a checkers game and you've made a "new" game.<br><br>Would that really matter?

Its easily work-aroundable by specifying the path instead of switching the dir eg. LoadMesh("meshes\thing.x") is okay but ChangeDir(meshes) isn't. Bit annoying, but I think this also allows you to access external media NOT wrapped up in the exe (so you could give the user access to some things and not others). ChangeDir() essentially breaks out of the encrypted exe back to the working directory. Good stuff. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
