Given myself more gold and what-not.  The problem is stopping somebody like me from doing that to an online game.<br><br>Most hacking issues can be resolved with encrypted data transmission and performing all game logic calculations server side, but I cannot stop somebody from writting a tool which monitors an online program by reading out it's variable space.<br><br>Take this one for example: <a href="http://www.showeq.net/" target="_blank">http://www.showeq.net/</a><br>This program is responsible for completely changing the dynamics of end game raid play in the original Everquest game, and is a helluva usefull tool when powerlevelling secondary accounts, and of course, identifies rare monsters the moment you enter a zone.  It's total cheeting.<br><br>I've even been asked to write a map position monitoring tool for Medal of Honour Allied Assault.  So far i've resisted, but the financial bait is tempting (the rival product is £4k a copy).<br><br>Whilst my own project isn't quite in the same leagues as these games it does use a centralised server - it's not an MMORG or anything like that but the temptation to cheat will still be there and cheating is big business in online software.<br><br>Even in the indie game Web Space Alliance which had a small community of a few thousand players up until the demise of the game a few months back had a regular bi-weekly/monthly purge of cheaters and the lists of banned accounts would often be 10-20 long.<br><br>Cheating in online games is big business.  "Farmers" are millionaires...<br><br>If "somebody" had worked out how to write an AI application to play an entire group of Everquest characters form one program that could be run on a single PC 4 times concurrently, thus playing 24 characters 24 hours a day via AI with constant play time, no searching for hunting partners or camps so able to get the best camps and hold them - they could therefore get 24 characters to maximum level in a week or so.<br><br>That "somebody" could have made about £1000 per character sold  ....  And if I had realised the commercial possibilities of that when the game was popular I might even have finished writting it, but I was just playing around. (I got past handshaking / connection by directing the client to my own "server" and vice versa which was all editable in text files and then partly deciphered the ingame data packet format and got confused/stuck).<br><br>Crickey, I didn't write all that to be defensive or anything - I just kinda started explaining and the next thing I know i've written war and peace ! doh, sorry... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Perhaps there's a flag that will make it ignore it but without the header the hacker might not know its a UPX exe in the first place.<br><br>As for memory security, creating a bank si probably the best way.  Then write everything in very screwed up ways. have some number of byte order patters for integers:<br><br>1234 (normal int -prolly dont want to use this)<br>1423<br>2423<br>3241<br>2314<br>3214<br><br>etc etc.  In this example I've got 5 ways of storing it. The position in the bank mod 5 determines which one to use ;).<br><br>Strings can be stored backwards with all their charachters offset by the bank position mod 128, and when it runs out of space in front of it it could write say, charachter 4 followed by the offset of the string's continuation.<br><br>I'd just have all the positiongs of variables the same run to run.  no worrying about a dynamic data structure because the data inside is already messed up.  You could also try doing stuff on non-byte border alignments - start the bank's data off at byte .5 so every byte is the last byte's lower 4 bits and the next byte's upper 4 bits.<br><br>If this isn't enoguh for you i suppose you could have a second bank that stores screwed up strings for variable names-&gt;memory location stuff, and have it generated randomly each runtime.<br><br>Its surprising how many people focus on higher bittage encryption algorithms where screwing upt eh order of the data in interesting ways works nearly as well, especially because there's so many things you can do. I've even had a program where the entire output file is randomly reversed, and whether or not it is reversed is determined by the very middle byte in the whole file which is 1 or 0. 0 for flipped 1 for not, among other protection schemes similar to the above stuff. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The master hash would be for the whole program minus the hash itself (it'd be nearly impossible to find one that corresponded to a file with itself inside it).  Other hashes in the file could also be skipped. these ones storing the hashes of all the others stuck together. so as long as the hacker doesnt find one or neutralize all of the many checks of the hash of the exe, hopefully a few of these hidden in various ways with tricky math and no strings to find.<br><br>Coming up with hacker detterants is fun :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The client program works out the location of the character and lets the server know about it.  People use packet sniffers to work out how this data is transferred and they write a program or whatever to change the data, or insert new data before it is sent from your computer.  I had no idea WoW sufferred from this.  I'm REALLY suprised they havn't learnt from Diablo 2.  Maybe they aren't as rich as I thought.<br><br>Plug for Final Fantasy XI - character position is calculated by the server and sent down to the clients.  Cheating?  What's that..?  This means a big expensive server cluster to calculate 20k players and make it look real time...  Then times the cost of that setup by 10 (the number of game worlds they run - could be more).  This kind of setup is ... not cheap.  Or fun to maintain.  But I think Square proved with their movie that they have more cash than a games company probably should ;]<br><br>There -are- cases where the client can correct the server on it's information (I think this is limited to area changes though)...  but SE force down patches so often that a hole like that gets plugged within 2 months anyway (ie if it's not considered severe) - oh, and usually legal regals pursue. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
