I was wondering if there is any way to do it via the WinAPI or something like that? Bit of a long shot, I guess, but it would be very useful.<br><br>Note: I'm not talking about something you can do with internal Blitz commands. This would have to be heigher than that, either interfacing with Direct Input, or the OS itself. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

#SPI_GETMOUSESPEED=112
#SPI_SETMOUSESPEED=113

ProcedureDLL.l GetMouseSensitivity()
  MouseSpeed.l=0
  SystemParametersInfo_(#SPI_GETMOUSESPEED,0,@MouseSpeed,#SPIF_SENDWININICHANGE)
  ProcedureReturn MouseSpeed
EndProcedure 

ProcedureDLL SetMouseSensitivity(Sense.l)
  SystemParametersInfo_(#SPI_SETMOUSESPEED,0,Sense,#SPIF_SENDWININICHANGE)
EndProcedure
</pre><br><br><br>And the DECLS looks like this :<br><br><pre class=code>.lib "mouse.dll"

GetMouseSensitivity%()          :"GetMouseSensitivity"
SetMouseSensitivity%(Sense%)    :"SetMouseSensitivity"
</pre><br><br><br>I've tested these and they seem to work just fine. If there's a site that hosts Blitz-specific DLL's, I'd be happy to upload the compiled DLL for anyone who wants this and doesn't have PB. If I uploaded it to my own space, I'd only forget about it, delete it and leave a broken link for everyone in the future. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
