I've made a calculator based on an equation which returns the total horsepowers needed to overcome the total air resistance at given speed, frontal car area, drag coefficient, and air density. What it returns is number of horsepowers needed to overcome the air resistance. The speed must be given in meters/s, and frontal car area in meters2. In an ordinary day, the air density is about 1013.25. Let's say we have the following information:<br>We drive in an ordinary day (air density: 1013.25), in 100 km/h, which is 27.777 m/s. We drive in a Jeep Cherokee, which has a drag coefficient on 0.45, and a frontal area on 2.4 m2 (see <a href="http://www.teknett.com/pwp/drmayf/tbls.htm" target="_blank">http://www.teknett.com/pwp/drmayf/tbls.htm</a> ) for more info about that). Then we will have the following info:<br>Air Density: 1013.25<br>Velocity: 27.777<br>Frontal Area: 2.4<br>Drag Coefficient: 0.45<br><br>The program will the return that you need 154.214 horsepowers to overcome the air resistance in a Jeep Cherokee in 100 km/h. This is the program I created: <a href="http://www.thps3cu.com/carphysics.zip" target="_blank">http://www.thps3cu.com/carphysics.zip</a> . I'll post the formula it uses later if anyone wants it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Most players drive cars and have a pretty good idea of how they should handle, if not at high speed at moderate speed. Plenty of effort goes into making flight sims satisfy the relatively small number of players who can fly planes (and even I know enough about aerodynamics to realise that your wings don't help you gain altitude when they're vertical...).<br><br>A friend of mine drives rally cars for fun. The first thing he does when he plays a car game (and he likes car games) is try to do the stuff that you actually need to do in a fast moving car to take hard corners on dirt tracks (it involves using the clutch, brake, and accelerator at the same time) etc. and most car sims don't cut the mustard (GTurismo may, but GTheftAuto certainly doesn't). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
