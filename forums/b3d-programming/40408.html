I have started on the project and ready to give out information, you may have seen my posts in the Art Showcase area about terrain... <br><br>I want the project to go commercial but i don't have any money to pay anyone. I would be willing to split the profits around though.<br><br>Anyways does anyone have an advice before i officially start asking people to help me out? It's not a project i plan on trashing, i'm very dedicated to it, it's just i'm not all that great when it comes to 3D graphics :-( <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This probably means coming up with a new project, a small (throwaway?) one to complete as a first team project instead of the project you've already started.  The point of the first project is to get the groundwork in place of getting the team assembled and acclimated, so make the first project piss easy.  The team will need to have at least one project under its belt to build up team confidence and so that the team members can get used to working with each other before you can attempt an ambitious project.<br><br>You want to start with a small project so that it is more likely the team will complete the project; the confidence gain from finishing one project will be imperitive for completing other, more ambitious projects.  This first project should probably be a throwaway (that is, don't bother trying to come up with the most interesting idea ever, just do something) so that if things fall apart it won't be a big deal and you can pick up and try again with a new team.  A hard-and-fast rule here is that if the team can't complete a first small project within a reasonable deadline, you should all cut your losses and disband because you definitely won't be successful working on a larger project.<br><br>A good idea with the first project is to wait until the team is assembled and then come up with the idea together.  This way everyone on the team will feel ownership of the idea and will be that much more motivated to do their part.  That said, make sure the plans stay small, something like Pac-man in 3D. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

By "Pac-man" I'm only referring to the gameplay, not the aesthetics.  Get together some artists and ask them what kind of art they want to create.  How about instead of a yellow sphere being chased by ghosts around a neon maze, you make a game about a girl being chased by anthropomorphized playing cards around a hedge maze?  Oh wait...<br><br>As for who would want to do such a small game, make sure to communicate to your team that the point isn't to sell (or even necessarily distribute) that first game, but to learn game development and how to function as a team.  If the person you're talking to isn't interested in learning how to function as a team and/or ensuring that you can function as a team before delving into an ambitious project, that person isn't someone you want on your team. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Either you're a close group that have known each other a long time and work well together, or you manage a team with the threat of sacking someone that doesn't fulfill they're task. Without this you will find that initial work is good but soon team members get sidetracked with other actvities and never finish anything. Riverrat and GfK are *both* right. As long as you don't have high hopes of finishing anything with a loosely assmebled team, it might be good experience, but otherwise except frustration and an eventual giving-up after umpteen months of no progress.<br><br>I could suggest you write the game and do the graphics and sound yourself. Then release (to a select audience?) and offer a cut of sales for anyone that wants to do replacement sound/gfx. If you write your code with this in mind you can just replace your meshes with someone else's. Maybe accept submissions from varying artists also, if the visual style would work. Advertising to CG forums might attract beginner modellers wanting to stretch their skills, and the small financial+glory incentive might focus them on your project as opposed to just experimenting themselves.<br><br>A suggestion at least. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

(Most of my work is for companies who order customized games) <br><br>They will eventually pay some up-front cash, which helps to motivate the team too.
