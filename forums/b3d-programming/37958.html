I have an extensive printing background and DTP / Graphics Design skills - and the patience to type in every single page of the online / offline electronic manual.<br><br>If anyone would be interested in such a book / manual - then I need some ace programmers to help me devise legible and readable tutorials that can lead users through various game and program types.<br><br>I already have many games and snippets i've produced that would help people, but I would still like to have programmers, like (and this is not to 'guilt-trip' you in) Halo, Rottbott, BloodLocust, etc who have a firm grasp of Blitz 3D - and yes, I am really focussing on game programming and manual for Blitz 3D and not 2D as much.<br><br>So, let me know if you are interested, because I am going to begin anyway, as I need a PRINTED form for me to create what I need for G.E.C.K.O. anyway.<br><br>I look forward to replies.<br><br>Mike Felker <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you cannot or there is no way to buy a printed manual or book, then we need a printed manual / book.<br><br>By the way, isn't there a book that exists for BLITZ BASIC owners that they can buy in the book stores?<br><br>Here are three books I found as a tiny search on Aamazon:<br>"Game Programming for Teens" MENTIONS Blitz Basic<br>as does "Game Design Workshop: Design, Prototyping and PlayTesting Games" - I guess these authors must be guilty of plaigarism too????

I've been trying to learn Blitz (I still use Blitz Plus 2D but planned to go to Blitz 3D once I mastered Blitz Plus 2D), but even with Blitz Plus 2D, it'll be great to have a book that explains the different commands and that gives clear examples as to how they can be used in a game like Super Mario Brothers and a fighting game. Sometimes, I wish there were books or things that I could find that gives more than one example of how to do things with the various commands because sometimes beginners like myself needs more than one example to clearly see how some of the commands could apply in different games and thus I could get a better idea on how some commands work.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So I thought I'd share. the manual I put together is ripped from online blitz3d manual.<br> it's made specifically for freebasic users who want to use angros47's openB3D library for said freebasic, but since it's commands are taken straight out of here the manual is the blitz3d info directly. Included is all the 3d commands. <br>the 2d based blitzbasic stuff can be found online in several places. if there was any demand I might be willing to add the 2d commands later and post an update.<br><br><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/download/6bqlqeg9960lt93/blitz3d_manual.zip" target="_blank">http://www.mediafire.com/download/6bqlqeg9960lt93/blitz3d_manual.zip</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

When I was learning them, it was like Gymnopedia to have 3 different "versions" of each command like that, it was really helpful :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
