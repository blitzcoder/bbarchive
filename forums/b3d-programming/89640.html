Try both loops with both the assignment and the operation commented out and on my machine one was a full 150ms faster than the other.<br><br>It's one of the unfortunate shortcomings of Blitz3D that it's really not very transparent about what the compiler's doing - the arrangement of variables can have a bigger effect than what you actually do with them - as well as that some structures like For loops aren't optimised very heavily - in this test, the loops alone were taking up 95% of the time on my computer, commenting out the stuff inside them.<br><br>If you really need this kind of optimisation, write the routine in C and import it! (In the right circumstances, GCC with the max optimisation flag set can produce code upwards of twenty times faster than B3D) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I didn't post code for division tests but it is exactly the same - no difference, if anything Shr takes longer.  It doesn't really matter anyway - a few ms difference after 300 million loops is pretty insignificant.<br><br>Yasha:  Your 150ms gap with no ops demonstrates the uselessness of my example pretty well.  I tried commenting the actual variable code out as well.  My machine had an insignificant 1 ms gap, and the loops themselves took 1/4 of the time than with the assignment and calculations, but your points are accurate anyway.<br><br>This topic is pretty useless in itself - I was surprised that changing everything from calculations to shifts had no impact on speed and was a bit quick to post. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
