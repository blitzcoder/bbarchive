The player is then kind of sticked to the lift cabine while it's in action. I a not very happy with this. TO day I'd probably try it again and simply add a collisoin check in both directions: plaver versus platform and platform versus player to make sure the player cannot fall trough the platform with gravity applied. If this works, whtn it's surely the simplest and yet most effective way. ALthough, vertical moving platforms still don't work. They would require some kind of friction simulation, at least as long as no physics engine will do he job anyway.<br><br>So I'd try somthing like<br><br>Collsions type_player,type_lift,2,2<br>collsions type_lift,type_player,3,2<br><br>Of course, EntityBox must be set for the player mesh in the right size, as well as EntityRadius for both, player and platform. Maybe you also need to move the player slightly up before you start the lift.<br><br>After all those wasted hours of debugging a complicated exception-handled elevator I can only suggest: keep it simple and clean. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

As soon as they step off the lift, re-apply gravity.<br><br>The model I use for the player is a sphere on top of a linepick, think of it as a lollypop ^^ and this works well since the sphere never actually comes into contact with the lift ( unless the lift comes down on top of the player, and my code knows that if player sphere collides with lift then the player is being crushed.)<br><br>In essence the linepick solves the problem of the player colliding with the lift since it actually stops this from occuring when the player is above the lift. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
