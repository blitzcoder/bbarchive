Because I’ve been incredibly stupid.  <br>And I am SO embarrassed.<br><br>About a year ago I had a complete rant about Windows 7 effects on my Blitz code.<br>It started quite a flame-war, good and bad things were said on both sides, and I left the site (-felt like I was driven out, actually).<br><br>Life got busy with other things, but recently I thought I should get it sorted out and emailed Mikhail of FastLibs about the problem.  “Hey Mikhail, your FastExt_Example_TextureBlends.bb goes wrong in Windows 7.”<br><br>I got a lovely answer back:<br>“Once again would like to express respect for you!<br>You made a big contribution to Blitz3D community.<br>I was trained on your examples, thanks.<br>About a problem - I don't observe it. I do not know as to reproduce, sorry :(<br> p.p.s. Look the attached screenshot (Win7 Max, Radeon HD4850)”<br><br>The attached screenshot showed his code working perfectly in Windows 7.<br>But it was the last word in the message that made me go cold:  Radeon.<br>I couldn’t possibly have .... (I went cold.)<br><br>Of course I bought an expensive Windows 7 machine.<br>With lotsa memory.<br>And lotsa speed.<br>And they surely put a decent graphics card inside....<br><br>IT’S AN INTEGRATED GRAPHICS CHIP!  AARRGGHH!<br><br>(Now tell me that _you’ve_  never felt so stupid at least once in your life.  No?  I don’t believe you.)<br><br>Quick trip to PC World for a graphics card.  Nothing special.  A £30 Radeon.<br>Ok. Run the code again.<br>OMG – it looks perfect!<br><br><br>As far as I can see, the only ‘real’ Blitz problem (at least in my code) was the fact that sprites could not be created with a parent parameter, but had to have a second EntityParent line.<br><br>But my code, FastLibs, BlitzSys, WinBlitz, works perfectly.<br><br>Ok – throw the custard pies this way.<br><br>I deserve them.<br><br>- John<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
