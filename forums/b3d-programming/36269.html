I do occasionally use the other file formats (JPG or BMP for solid images, TGA for alpha transparency) but only because converting images to PNG is occasionally a hassle (thank you Photoshop.)<br><br>As for image size, use the smallest that looks good enough.  Sorry there isn't a better answer really.  It's all judgement calls.  I would personally recommend higher res (like 512) for the heightmap image because you want more resolution there, the color map is a total judgement call so try both, and lower res (256 or even 128) for the detail map because it will be tiled. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
