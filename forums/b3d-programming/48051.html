AGP will take care of the texture swapping (main mem &lt;&gt; VRAM), you don't need to cram them all in at the same time - but that would be the best / fastest case. Buffers and geometry take surprisingly lot of VRAM too, so textures are not the only thing that need fast memory. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Using surfaces with small number of polygons will result small batch size and GPU will be idling - because setup and such take certain amount of time regardless of the actual amount of polgons to be sent... Sweetspot seems to be these days around 2000 triangles, meaning that a surface with 1 polygon will render just as fast as 2000 triangles. Larger batches are better because modern hardware is made so that it can churn out very fast gzillions of polygons - if they share the same properties... small change and it has to start again and get the machine going. So I would try to avoid low surface / polygon ratio if possible. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you have another polygon that differs from this setup, it's another surface. To be in the same surface polygon properties have to be identical.<br><br>If you two separate OBJECTS that have identical materials, those are separate surfaces to my knowledge. So every object is at least surface, even if they all have identical texture properties... that's why low-polygon objects are "wasting" render time.<br><br>Forcing stuff to VRAM can be good sometimes, but I'd be very careful when to do that because you are restricting DirectX and how it can manage your stuff over the AGP... and yes, all textures and geometry have be moved to VRAM so that GPU can access those. <br><br>Significance of the flag is that it marks the texture as non-movable meaning that DX cannot dump it from the VRAM if it needs more space for rendering the frame. Having lot's of (or big) textures marked this way reduces the amount of VRAM DX can use dynamically and might lead to drop in FPS in some cases if you go over board. All this again according to my "best knowledge and educated guesses"... only Mark can give 100% correct techical answers about Blitz3D. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The test basically renders a very simple scene very much unoptimized, revealing a weakness in most graphics drivers available today. Graphics IHVs have for years educated game developers to render as large batches as possible. However, it would be beneficial if the rendering of smaller batches would be optimized too. This test has been requested ever since developing 3DMark2001, but for this 3DMark version more BDP members than just one asked for it. There are six runs of this test, where 128 meshes of 128x128 quads are draw with 8, 32, 128, 512, 2048 and 32768 triangles per batch. The last two batch sizes should be considered an optimized one for most drivers today, but the smaller the batch sizes get, the slower the rendering will be. Color change state changes are done between the rendering batches to make sure DX doesn't collapse the whole rendering into a single or very few batches. Early versions of this test without the state changes caused this, and gave quite obscure results. The test therefore also is somewhat dependent on how fast the driver does rendering state changes.<br> <br></div> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
