Yeah that was supposed to be a joke for "JPEG," but w/e.<br><br>So, I've had odd experiences with non-PNG textures while making my game, mostly due to my own lack of preemptive knowledge, and I'm wondering: if I want something like a plain, flat background, with no alpha blending or ANY special filtering, just a single quad with a scrolling, colour texture, are there any potential problems that can arise from using a JPEG image? It does of course conform to the normal ^2 rule, with three selectable sizes of 4096x2048, 2048x1024 and 1024x512, and it's a normal RGB image, no paletting, no special compression of any sort, just a JPEG like any other.<br><br>I normally use PNG by default, simply because it's lossless, but in this case the lossy compression of JPEG doesn't matter because it's almost invisible on this particular image, and even at Quality:100 it's roughly one thenth the size of its PNG equivalent (even at maximum compression). 550KB is by far preferable over 5.5MB, even <i>in</i> today's world where storage concerns decrease constantly. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Everything other than DDS is just expanded to a full bitmap at load time, so the results should be identical.<br><br>I have a different observation though - what on Earth needs a 4096p texture? That's normally a sign that you need to break something up into smaller objects (or you're making a very pretty, high-detail game and should be using Leadwerks &lt;/snark&gt;).<br><br>I've noticed that texture sizes above 2048 can't be relied upon to exist in B3D on all hardware. Some go up to 8192, but not many. On the other hand, this probably won't be a problem for modern cards with enough memory to actually display that sort of thing easily. If this is a high/medium/low detail option for the user to customise to their PC, you might need to do a check that they can actually match the settings if they choose higher ones.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Mostly a cosmetic effect. I just wanted to give it justice on larger screen configurations, and since 1920x1080 and 1920x1200 are fairly common nowadays, I figured I'd cover it with a nice 2048-high texture. That said, I may in fact scale the 4096x2048 to be a 2048² instead; I'll see how that looks today. I had heard of the &gt;2048 issue before, but understood that since it's mostly older graphics cards that have this problem, I needn't be particularly concerned.<br><br>So, if all non-DDS imagery is unpacked into 32-bit bitmap form, then I guess that's all I need worry about.
