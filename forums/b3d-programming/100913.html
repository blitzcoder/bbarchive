Thread 0 (main program) may read the value of global <b>th_allow</b>, <br> but it may not write to that variable.  That would cause chaos.<br><br> (<b>B</b>). The currently "chosen" thread may freely change the value of <b>th_allow</b> to any other thread it wishes, <br> since no other thread currently has permission to write to <b>th_allow</b> .<br> In other words, it passes the torch to someone else.<br><br> Hope that it all makes sense.  It's just an experiment.  <img src="http://i37.photobucket.com/albums/e73/VirtLands/emoticons/Yahoo%20emoticons/14.gif"> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This task is <i>inherently</i> non-parallel; all you're doing is pausing threads so that others can have a go doing something, which ... defeats the entire purpose of having threads at all. How does this example stretch to actually parallelising work and allowing concurrent access to data?<br><br>Secondly, no part of this involves mutex. It is <i>not possible</i>, on any level, to simulate a mutex in software. They only work because of platform-specific CPU-instruction-level support.<br><br>I'm having difficulty following the logic of the example, and it could well be that your logic is safe <i>for this particular example</i> because the linear, non-threaded nature of the task means there might never be a conflict here, but I must reiterate that there is <i>absolutely no way</i> to implement a generally-reliable mutex in software. It cannot be done <i>by definition</i>. Writing to globals is <i>not atomic</i>: when two threads are working on the same task at the same time there is no way for them to safely write to one global variable. That's... the entire point of why this is an issue. I think this example only works because you've set the threads up so that they don't work concurrently.<br><br>I don't mean to sound pessimistic or to dismiss the thought you've put into this, but it's really not a problem that can be usefully solved by global variables.<br><br>(On a more theoretical and annoying level, I would continue to argue that mutexes and semaphores <i>do not</i> constitute multithreading support anyway: they're what you use to <i>build</i> support into a higher-level language that hides them completely from the user, but they themselves are also very difficult to use properly.) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
