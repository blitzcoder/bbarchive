My brain has been in a continuous loop for the past couple of days trying to sort this out, but I don't think my math is up to the task.  I'm hoping someone here will be able to help me out or at least steer me in the right direction!<br><br>Here's the problem.  I have 2 or more simple meshes that I'm creating on the fly.  They only need to be flat triangles with no real 3d depth.  As I do this, or after I do this, I need to determine whether or not they overlap, and if they do, I need to create a separate mesh that exactly matches their intersection.  (this is so that I can handle that intersected area differently visually and computationally).  <br><br>I've considered 2 possible approaches to this, but both have their difficulties and challenges.<br><br>1. The first approach i've considered is giving the meshes a little depth and then linepicking extensively from where the meshes are originating from to try to find the points where it collides with the other mesh, record these and then try to build a mesh out of them.   2 things make this really difficult -- I have to also linepick backwards towards the original object to find the end of the intersection, and i think that it will be very challenging to build the mesh correctly once i've found the intersection points (not sure how to organize all those points so that i can connect them right).<br><br>2. The second approach i've considered is to try to do some old-fashioned 2d wizardry, rendering the scene to image buffers and trying to figure out the intersections based on colors.  If I were to render the scene top-down I could pretty easily show the intersections in a different color (by making the meshes additive), but once i've done that, it seems like i'll be stuck doing a whole mess of "readpixelfast"s which will be slow.  Once I finished that, I could presumably place the result in a texture and give the UV coords to make it overlay the meshes correctly, though, which would be pretty simple.<br><br>So does anyone have suggestions for either approach?<br><br>If I go with the mesh way, is there a way to evaluate these intersections without all the linepicking?  (i guess with straight up math?)  Or is there some other method that I'm missing?<br><br>If I go with the second method, is there a way that I could evaluate the colors of the image / intersecting areas without reading every pixel to test its color?  Maybe using images as textures overlaying one another?  I am afraid I am out of my depth :)<br><br>Ok, I think I'll shut up now.  Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions!  <br><br>cheers,<br>roland <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You could basically use a line intersection function to determine all points of intersection between the edges of the 2 tris - these will be your new vertex coords.<br><br>There's actually going to be more to it than that as the intersection may be a polygon with more than 3 sides. Look at The Star of David for a worse case senario. This'll require some intelligent triangulation of the intersection poly. Hmm, actually, the actual triangulation wont be that difficult.<br><br>Just thinking out loud, here. :P <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

They are made up of many triangles, though, not just one.  To make matters even worse, there is the possibility of having to check between more than 2 meshes as well -- it is possible that 3 or more meshes may intersect at any given point.<br><br>Here's a diagram that might help to explain what this looks like... I can post some code later if that would help test as well.    in this diagram, the green dots represent the origin of the meshes that are being generated -- these can be rotated and the triangles (shown by white lines) are cast out from the origin to a set distance at the angle specified.  <br><br>In this diagram, there is a red mesh and a blue mesh, and their intersection is shown as magenta.  I outlined the intersection just to make it more clear what area would need to be treated differently.  <br><br><img src="http://www.prayercore.com/roland/meshintersection.gif"><br><br>To answer your other question, big10p, I don't think it matters if the original triangles are left or not -- i will probably have the intersected mesh obscure them either way.<br><br>Thanks for your help -- and keep the questions coming :)<br><br>cheers,<br>roland <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you could get all the intersect points, you could easily make the mesh using this code.<br><br>Another way you could do this.<br><br>It's similar to a lightmap, and may work better than the triangle idea, as you'll be able to blend the texture with the texture of the ground below. Create a texture to cover the area of the ground. Even if it's just the area in view. Then, each frame, point the camera from above, render ONLY the light polygons onto a black backround, or grey (128,128,128) depending on if you want thedark parts to darken, or remain a neutral colour. Then, COPYRECT this onto your texture used to cover the ground area.<br><br>If you do this every frame, you'll probably need to use the VRAM flag on the texture your copying to, you won't need to worry about the amount of light polygons, or the intersection. TIP: when rendering, you could try and change the camera view distance to just what you need to render the light polygons, giving you less chance of having overlapping issues.<br><br>I might give this a try when i get home to show you what i mean.

Instead, make a copy of the mesh yourself, before performing all the required clips on it.<br><br>A further optimization would be to use a proxy mesh, as I mentioned in my last post. This would mean the initial mesh to clip would be a single triangle, instead of many, as used in your main meshes.<br><br>There should be other optimizations to be had, too. For example, as these are basically 2D meshes, a constant can be used for the vertex coords of the unused dimension.<br><br><div class="quote"> b) it will be fast enough... even with really simple meshes (~ 20 -30 tris), i wonder if it will be able to do as many as 100 or 200 clips per frame? seems like it would be asking a lot to do that and still achieve 60fps. <br></div>Well, I guess only testing will tell. :) However, I think it should be fast enough, given the optimizations I mention above.

I can't figure out how I could handle this type of effect on a texture.<br><br>big10p -- i'm wondering if it would be simpler to use some more straighforward line-line intersection equations to determine intersection points rather than to clip the meshes?  this of course means that i would have to create the tris from the intersected portions, but might be simpler... I was messing with the clipping code last night and couldn't quite figure out how to set the plane in the right place using only one positioning variable (y)... i guess i need to take some more time trying to wrap my head around that.<br><br>If anyone has ever seen a simple function to take 2 triangles and extract their overlapping portions, i would love to see that.
