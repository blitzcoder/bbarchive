I'm getting a memory access violation. Help please. Do I always need to use render tweening with tokamak physics? Or is it just there in all the examples because it's better? Here's my code, it's a bit butchered because of my panic but it should work. You may as well just change Global ship01=LoadMesh("ship1.b3d") to Global ship01=createCube() to make it able to work when / if it does. <br><br><pre class=code>

</pre><br><br>I am using the tokamak rigid body editor and when I create the rigid body object it is the same as what I get when I export .bb except without the setmaterialindex command because I removed or changed most of the variable names and was too lazy to deal with it. All I am trying to do for now is draw the ship onscreen with the tokamak rigid body working if you're wondering. I don't thuink I finished setting up the camera either, so if you get nothing but no memory access violation that's good, you don't need to set it up.<br><br>Thanks in advance <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
