I dallied with 3D RAD many moons ago - initially it was quite impressive but its far too limited to do anything serious.<br><br>I think this whole "Engine" question is superfluous - all a 3D Engine is is a collection of functions that work together to simulate a Real -World 3D scenario - I would feel uncomfortable writing a set of functions in Blitz or any other high level language and then saying that I had created a 3D engine - when really the 3D Engine is DirectX neatly wrapped up and exposed to you by Blitz. Even if you write your own lower level functions in C++ you are just wrapping up either DirectX or OpenGL functions that have already been written by someone else !<br> It is possible in theory to write your own version of OpenGL - like Microsoft did - DirectX is Microsoft's version of OpenGL - and then one could claim to have written an engine.<br>Regarding scripting - once again this can be achived with Blitz.<br>There are examples of Blitz scripting engines in the Blitz code archives.<br><br>The demo is nearing completion.<br>Things left to do:<br> - Upgrade to latest Blitz version and incorporate the Joystick Axis functions.<br>- Finalise Wingman orders system (90% complete) .<br>- Create better working model for Friendly fighters. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
