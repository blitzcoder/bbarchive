The blitz ide is flaky for me on multiple machines.  It has weird little quarks, like holding shift and hitting the left arrow to select something will sometimes result in just the cursor moving left.  Sometimes if the window is inactive and you drag text over the window slightly from another window it will flake out and select random chunks of code.  It is REALLY good practice to have clean code separated into include files that all have similar functions.  I honestly dont understand how you work with everything in one large file.  Whatever you are coding should be able to be broken up into files that all have similar functions.  Say a user interface, graphics, ai, rendering whatever youre doing should be split up.  Its especially easy to reuse functions and having modular code this way aswell.  Ive also had problems &gt;10k lines... and im on a dell workstation with more than enough specs.  Its the ide... if you refuse to sort your code... do as Devil or Gabriel suggested and use a different ide. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The problem I had last time (for some reason I can't find my old post now) is that the include files wouldn't work properly because variables weren't declared etc. I think somebody suggested that the includes have to be placed correctly to avoid this problem, but I can't remember how it works. Basically, if I have a global variable, should that be declared BEFORE the include line, if the included file needs access to that variable? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If part of the code deals with a 3D engine, then make a 3D engine bitz basic source file.  if the other portion deals with game logic, make a game blitz basic file.  If part of your code deals with AI, make an AI bb code, etc...  If your program is well written, you shouldn't have to worry about global and local variables, as everything will be self contained.  It's good practice to define types and store your stuff logically in your type.  Making a Game Type with your counters, your game status and all sorts of crap that refers to your game running should go in there and right after the type just initialize that type to a global, and that gloabl should only be used in your game.bb source.  if you need to communicate stuff between game.bb and AI.bb, then you make functions.<br><br>It's a question of how you program and how clean is your code.  I suggest looking that seriously. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
