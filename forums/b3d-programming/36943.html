I was just wondering is there a compressison difference between compilers?<br><br>Another thing i was looking at also is, that it has tons of other files... I know when you compile a game in blitz it'll put your .exe and you put your media files in the same folder but isn't that kinda easy to reach for the consumer? can't he just modify that with a click of a button and ruin your game? so i went googling for the answer and found packers that'll put  your exe in one file... but then i was thinking to myself... if i were to sell a game and distributed a CD with only 1 file on it how would the consumer feel? would he think he may have gotten ripped off? Are there other ways to put your media with a compiled .exe without putting it in a single .exe? I don't know but is there a way to use your own format in blitz? <br><br>I know just some silly questions lol but i'm curious cuz i'm thinking i am ready to move onto making a commercial game sometime soon... *(maybe)* heheh! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Well it's for sure that the .exe files don't take the whole disk space! Where did you look for that btw? Because Windows will always tell you that there's no space on the CD since it's fixed. Try burning a 2 mb file on a CD and fix it.<br><br>Why don't you use a packer? It creates a .pak file for all your media, some even have the possibility of encryption. I think it's ok to have 2 files or so. Most games don't have many more. And if you'll put your savegames and the documentation in the same folder it'll look a bit more :)<br><br>Good luck with your commercial game ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This alows you to change and tweak many aspects of your game externally on the fly without needing to find that 'energy=99' value SOMEWHERE in your code &amp; recompile your entire game...<br><br>Also you could start using a level editor for example to create err... levels! and such. This alows you to supply your gamers with new / additional level-packs and so on - without having to change any code or recompile your game again (re-install etc). <br><br>Once you decide to store certain data in external files, the first thing you'll need to do is define the file-format, wich makes it hard for users to read or change them. Using PAKmaker for example is a good way of prevent users to rip your graphics or models and rape your game..<br>Imagine beavis &amp; butthead shooting bananas out of their noses at the moon from the back of a chewbaka using a banana on a thursday morning.. nasty... oh well, there goes therapy...<br><br>Also you'll have to take loading-speed into account. Depending on the type &amp; amount of data and the packer you use. It could be faster in some cases to simply load 1 Mb of raw data in stead of loading 400Kb of compressed data, store that temporarily into memory, uncompress it, make it available to your game, and then get rid of the old 400kb data...<br><br>I used these old tricks with Simcity 1. For example, if i had only $123 left I would search for that '123' number in my save-file and change it to $1.000.000 so I could continue building ;) These days it's a bit more complex though. :)<br><br>Perhaps another reason why games could be so large is that they sometimes store the same graphics but for different screen-resolutions. Altough I don't believe this is actually true for EVERY graphic in a game...?!<br><br>my 2 cents..<br>Danny <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The game EXE is only 1.7MB (7%), the sound effects and music are 9MB (40%) and the graphics are 5MB (21%).<br><br>Obviously they are figures for a very small project.  You can expect figures for media being much higher in commercial games, as different levels will have different sounds, there's usually a lot more music and the inclusion of speech. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
