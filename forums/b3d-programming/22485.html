"<br><br>Although it may be true that most particle systems are quite alike and creating a generic particle system that is usefull for most people is quite possible, there are huge differences in complexity and preformance between many particle systems, some games need only simple effects and might be covered with simple single surface particle emitters which spray from a point based emitter with fluctuation, while particle stats only include things like startalpha,endalpha,startsize,endsize,minspeed,maxspeed,lifetime and some other basic data like coordinates, I can't be bothered to write you up a type right now.<br><br>Other games however, like my current titles have far different needs, my most functionaly advanced particle system supports features such as:<br><br>Any type of particle, be it: a whole mesh, a sprite or even a single surface particle emitter<br>Particle acceleration/deacceleration control during lifetime<br>Particle path following<br>Dynamic particle collision settings supporting things such as death on impact and bouncing<br>Magnets and repulsors<br>Tons of different emmision shapes, from point, to plane, to sphere, to cylinder, yielding such wonderfull effects as rings of fire, particle explosions etc.<br><br>This allows me to put together particles and emitters that preform almost any feat imaginable, be it a person completely built from particle effects, a tornado of whirling particles, massive colorfull explosions, the same explosion followed by the particles forming any kind of shape, such as letters or even a whole model, etc.<br><br>Although this is realy cool I doubt some of the simpler titles would ever use all this functionality, in which case it's much better to build a small custom system rigged for preformance, then using such a big prefabricated system of which you won't use 1/10'th of the features.<br><br>So to put it shortly, even if a built in particle system would meet all that and maybe advanced particle flocking while we are at it ;) It would still not be optimal for every project, yet if it would be simplified and basic it would not be optimal for the larger projects. Basicaly, your better off building what suits you... Plus it's a ton of fun! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The problem is due to alpha transparency and will arise any time you use alpha transparency.  However the problem is worse with a single surface particle system since, without z-buffer, the drawing order is based on entity distance.  And in a single surface particle system the entire particle system is a single entity, resulting in it either being entirely in front of or entirely behind other alpha entities.  That last point also gets at what I meant when I said that problem situations are rare; it only matters if you have something with alpha transparency inside the particle system (eg. a character with alpha hair walks through the smoke.)  In most situations in games it is okay to treat the entire particle system as a single entity. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
