So if anything important is kept in strings, it will be readable as plaintext to anyone who opens the file in a hex viewer (or text editor!). Obviously this only applies to strings actually written out in the program source, not ones constructed at runtime - so you could for instance store things in encrypted form and decrypt them before the program runs.<br><br>You really don't need to worry about this. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It contains features such as functions, types, variables, loops etc. to make code structured and readable. Machine code doesn't have those things; in simplistic terms, machine code really doesn't offer much beyond If, Goto, and numeric memory addresses. So the best even a team of experienced hackers could do is get some code with no variable names, and no functions or control structures because everything is done with Goto (if they're really clever, they might be able to represent the functions as Gosubs). There is <i>no</i> way they would ever get source code that actually looked like the original, because that level of information simply isn't preserved by the compilation process.<br><br>Seriously. You <i>don't</i> need to worry about this. There's nothing you could possibly produce in Blitz3D that it would be easier for someone to decompile, than to simply spend a few <i>million</i> dollars, hire a development team of several hundred, and crank the clone out from scratch. That's how hard this task is.<br><br>Simple example:<br><pre class=code>
While a &lt; b
    a = a + 1
Wend
</pre><br><br>...becomes (at best)...<br><br><pre class=code>
.L_0
If V_0 &lt; V_1 Then Goto L_1
V_0 = V_0 + 1
Goto L_0
.L_1
</pre><br><br>Now crank that level of uglification up by an order of magnitude to also account for functions, nested loops, arrays and types (neither of which exist, so you're dealing with raw memory address calculations), and so on. Even a slightly more complex application than the above becomes nightmarish to understand, especially for anyone who is trying to work out what it means rather than knowing in advance.<br><br><br>A far better idea than worrying about this is to simply attach a copyright notice to your code, and let the law protect your intellectual property if you think someone is stealing your work.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That is they dont need to figure out the function types and stuff, just find somewhere to have gone data1: 1,34,46,33 etc<br>Then one person being lucky, and preknowing something about the data, (say a map for example), then two hours comfortably. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Still, you can't just go and open a model file from a triple-A game - it's not like it's in .XSI or .MD2, it's a different format.<br><br>There are two main reasons for game files to be released in these 'not clearly readable' formats:<br><br>• <b>Compression</b>: more important in removable-media games (such as CDs and cartridges) where developers have a limited space in which they can store data. They <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_64#Programming_difficulties" target="_blank">compress</a> their original asset files with proprietary tools that use <a href="http://szs.wiimm.de/features.html#2" target="_blank">proprietary compression schemes</a>. Some of these schemes might even be directly implemented in hardware, such as specialized compression for textures, video etc. and are blazing fast to operate.<br>You can also see how the Quake series uses PAK files which are simply all the asset files compressed and bundled in a single pack. Modders can open these PAKs and modify them as they wish.<br><br>• <b>Memory Structure</b>: when you load an asset in your game you also create and populate a custom structure with this loaded asset and any pertinent information (say, for instance, a mesh class that holds vertex declarations, triangle indices etc.). <br>What developers do is process their assets with tools that create binary files of these populated structures. They grab the data currently in memory and write it as a file.<br>What you get for each processed file is a 'blob' of data that can be loaded in a single sweep and is ready to be used by the engine, which is incredibly faster - the engine doesn't have to seperately load the asset (parsing whatever specification the asset uses, such as 3DS or OBJ) then build a structure and populate it with data at load-time. So when they release their game, they won't include any original asset files, just these processed binary files.<br><br>These two reasons indirectly contribute to the 'not clearly readable' formats we find in professional game files, while their purpose is optimization and efficiency, not protection.<br><br>With this in mind:<br>You're much better off investing time in writing a clear and broad license to protect all your intellectual property.<br>While encryptions can be broken, a concise license is your ultimate defense in case someone does actually breach your terms with actions that do not constitute 'fair use'. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
