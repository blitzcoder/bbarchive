I've been trying to think about how deal with agent attempting to malee attack another player or agent without passing through each other.<br><br>A good example would be something like World of Warcraft.  If 3 bad guys spot you and start running toward you and attempt to attack you, how do you keep their meshes from passing threw each other in a logical fachion.  I say logical, because I know the cheezy easy route would be to us collision spheres on them and have the collision system just push them off of each other.  The only problem I see with this is that it could look sloppy .  I can see a scenario where an agent is pressed up again another agent and it's legs are running in place.<br><br>I'd prefer that if it detects that it is in the space on another agent, it would find a way around the offending agent.  I think if it was coded well, I think the end look would be much more natural, but I not sure what the best approach would be.<br><br>So you guys have any thoughts? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You would probably need to set a threshold above which they would then resort to normal movement (to stop 'popping/oscillating' around about the edges of collision spheres)<br><br>Does this need further expansion, or is it a dead end ? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I guess we're talking about some kind of enemy attack player in fps game AI, do we? Players may move freely, using some kind of A-Star or so pathfinding method. If they are doing realtime calcualtion then you may simply add them to the level walls one by one, from the closest to those far away: the enemy with the lowest distance to the player will do his moves first, then he will be added to the level walls that are used to find paths. The second nearest enemy will then have to walk around the first one. The third nearest will pass by the nearest and second nearest. And so on.<br><br>Although, I'm afraid true pathfinding complicates things a lot. Personally I'd rather use a number of waypoint tracks with lots of crossing points, where the enemies may "jump" on antother track, depending on the situation. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
