If I just use renderworld without the tweening it looks fine though so it's definelty something to do with the tweening.Any other ideas on what may be causing the problem? It looks just like the tweening anomaly where you want to make a object teleport but the tweening draws the object between the start and end points making it look like it moved very fast instead. Excpet the shadow looks like it's rotating back and forth 5 dgrees very fast."<br><br><br>Now, I'm positive that this is not a bug with the shadow system, because I _KNOW_ people have used tweening with my shadow system before.  But I'm not sure what _is_ causing it.  I'm not very familiar with render tweening.  I hate it. :-)  It's complicated and causes problems like these all the time.<br><br>So I thought I'd ask here, to see if anyone who has used render tweening with my system has had an issue like this and corrected it by tweaking their tweening loop somehow?<br><br>The only things the tweening code could affect would be the casters, or the receivers, but not the shadow meshes themselves... since they never actually move.  And I'm pretty sure from his description of the problem that it's not the receivers.  Shadows would be poking into geometry and stuff if he was moving receivers around and those weren't being updated probperly.  <br><br>So that leaves the casters. <br><br>Each frame I copy the caster in it's current frame of animation, paint it black, and use that to generate the shadow.  Then it is deleted.  There is seemingly no way tweening could affect this, but somehow it apparently is.<br><br>I'm guessing his tweening loop is messed up in some way, but I don't know how.  I've asked him to send me the code to his main loop so I can look at it though. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

SetAnimTime and Texture_Angle_Epsilon have nothing to do with eachother. :-)  So you probably chnaged something else to fix your problem.<br><br>Texture_Angle_Epsilon is a value which defines how much the angle between the light and the shadow caster needs to change before the system re-renders the shadow texture.<br><br>Ie, a shadow rendered directly above and object, and a shadow rendered directly behind an object are seperated by 90 degrees.  <br><br>Also, a shadow rendered from above an object, and a shadow rendered from above an object which has been pitched forward by 90 degrees, are also seperated by 90 degrees.  <br><br>Add these two transforms, and you have a difference of 180 degrees.<br><br>0.5 here means half a degree of change total.  So if the angle between light and object only changes by half a degree, meaning the outline the shadow represents hasn't changed much, then the shadow is not re-rendered that frame.  But if the angle between them changes by 0.6 degrees, then it is re-rendered.<br><br>All entities that animate force their shadows to be re-rendered every frame.  They cannot take advantage of those optimization.  There is no way to know how much their outline has changed from one frame to the next.<br><br>...<br><br>Hm...<br><br>Something occurs to me though.  If you do not set your entity to be animating, and only change it's animation frame with set anim time, assuming that works...  Then the system may not know that the entity is animating, and it would only update the shadow when the angle between the light and caster has changed sufficiently.  That would mean that if you just kept the entity in one spot with a static light source that is unmoving, unless you set epsilon to 0, the shadow would never match the animation.<br><br>But that ASSUMES that the Blitz animating() command will still return false if you have just changed the animtime, and that changing the animtime will work at all if if the entity is not animating.  If you have the entity set to animate but set it's animtime every frame, then things should work.  But if you ahve the entity not animating and set animtime every frame, assuming that works in Blitz, then you might have the problem you described with the shadow animation being "jerky".<br><br>So I guess episolon and setanimtime may have something to do with eachother after all.  I never considered someone would animate an entity without actually turning on animation.  Even with setanimtime. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Changing the FPS to 1 shows that what the problem really is is that the shadow is moving in coarse steps from one location to the next.<br><br>I think I may be starting to understand what is causing the behavior.<br><br>Let's say that I move an entity from point A to point B.<br><br><br>A -------------------- B<br><br>With render tween,  the entity will be rendered at every position marked by a *.<br><br>A ---*-----*------*--- B<br><br>But when I get the position of the entity in Blitz, so I can point the light source at it and render the shadow, the shadow system does not see the object at the position marked by the *'s.  It only sees it at A or B.<br><br>When you use tween with renderworld, you are usually rendering at one of the * locations.  So the shadow lags behind until you reach B, and then it catches up suddenly because you've updated the entity's location.  But when you update the entity's location, that means the shadow is leading it.  So the shadow waits there till the entity catches up, and then it jumps ahead again.  So actually it's not lagging behind... it's leading the entity.<br><br><br>There is no way I can fix this problem within the shadow system itself.  I have no way of knowing if tweening is enabled, or the tweened locations of entites, and to allow you to manage that through a tweening system built into the system would make the system much more complicated.<br><br>This seems like a pretty major oversight in the Blitz tweening system... And nobody has encountered this problem before?  It seems to me that it would affect skies being centered on cameras...  And fake shadows placed beneath players... unless they are parented to the camera, or player.  But if you parent a sky to a camera then it would rotate wit the camera... So.... have people been creating pivots which they parent the sky and camera to so the camera can pivot independently, but still move with the sky?<br><br>I hate tweening! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Ie, if you are going to update physics twice during a frame, you should only update the shadows on the second physics update.  The shaodws only need to be updated when you will actually see the change.  I do not know if how you had things set up was affecting the speed adversely or not, I'd have to see what you did. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But if the frame rate dropped below the physics update rate then you might get multiple physics updates for each RenderWorld, but dropping below 25 FPS is already becoming unacceptable performance (for my game anyway). I think I even tried only updating shadows every other physics update, so that would be something like one shadow update followed by four or five renderworlds!<br><br>If would love to know if I am doing something wrong? If I can find my original test code I might post it/send it?<br><br>I would point out that your shadow system worked very well when used with limited casters, recievers and lights - which you have always made very clear in your documentation anyway. I would love to use it as the effect was very nice :o) Would it be possible to build in more approximations to speed up the code with a slight loss in quality/precision?<br><br>Rhy Out <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
