<table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr ><td class="posthead"><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr ><td >Tony Hart</td><td align="right"><font class=tiny>(Posted 2005)</font>&nbsp;<a href="#1">[#1]</a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr ><td class="posttext"> I have searched through the code archives and everything to try to find a program source code that would help me learn how to read and write excel files but my search has come up with nothing. <br><br>What I am trying to do is this. Say I have 25 rows of data in one excel file with 10 columns of data. I would need to take each row individually, read the data, and have it take the data and put it in a new excel file that is formatted like a form. I need it to take column 1 and put it in the Name box in the excel form template I created, column 2 would be the address and it would put it in the address section on the form, etc.<br><br>I have the base files I need to use, I just need to learn how to read and write excel files and how to tell it where to put the information.<br><br>I am trying to write this program for my friend who works at an escrow office. He passes tons of these files a day and a program like this will increase his efficiency at least 10 fold. As of now, what my friend has to do is look at the file he gets from his lenders which contains the rows of data, then individually goes and types each column of data from the row into the form template he uses. As you can plainly see this can be very time consuming and hence he has to make his lenders wait longer. <br><br>If you could point me in the right direction, or possibly send me a sample source that would read a random number of rows I would be most appreciative. Let me explain on that. Like i said earlier, say the file has 10 columns on every row of records, but file one has 10 rows, file 2 has 38 records, and file 3 has 22 records. What I want it to do is take each file, read how many rows of data it has, and makes the same number of form files. So in the first file, it would make 10 forms using the 10 columns of data. File 2 would make 38 forms using the 10 columns of data, and file 3 would make 22 form files using the 10 columns of data.<br><br>I would be able to take a program like this and edit it to however many columns of data the rows have so I could use it for other purposes as well.<br><br>I don't need it to batch read multiple files. I just need it to read one file and create the multiple files properly according to the data written inside of the source file<br><br>If i could get something like that it would be most appreciative.<br><br>I purchased Blitz3D and have written some of the learning games but I havent gotten that good yet and I havent been able to find anything that would help me get this program written.<br><br>Thanks for your time! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
