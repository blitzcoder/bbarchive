The issue of updating the display is a particularly thorny one on a platform like the PC, where the hardware is not fixed.

They look smooth, but they only look smooth because cameras have motion blur and computer graphics do not.  Your computer screen updates at a minimum of 60fps.  And even this appears to flicker to some people, like myself, so 85hz is becoming the norm.<br><br>Your eyes are sensitive to changes in brightness, and they have a long decay time so you see an image for a little while after the image has changed.  With an image like this, the color goes instanty from white to black, and your eye takes a moment to adjust.  Also your brain processes the information in funny ways.  If a green pendulum swings back and forth and changes to red suddenly at the end of a swing, you will see the pendulum fade from green to red, over the course of the swing even though that is physically impossible because the pendulum didn't change color until the end of the swing.  <br><br>This effect is caused either by your eyes or by your brain interpreting what your eyes see.<br><br>Either way, in order to get rid of this effect, you'd either have to have motion blur, which you can forget about if your game can't run at over 30fps to begine with, or you have to run at a higher framerate.<br><br>Graphics with lower contrast will reduce the effect.  A white cube, or a textured cube, on a black background has high contrast so the effect is very obvious.  In a game, things in the environment are roughtly the same color as other stuff around them, so your eye doesn't see the double image.  Also, if the player controls the game with the mouse so the rotation speed varies, that appears to help too.<br><br>In short, you aren't doing anything wrong.  Your eyes are. :-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I've been lurking here for months and I've read many good things here (especially about your shadow system... nice work there).<br><br>Interestingly, my cube is grey against a black background so I see the point about motion blur (which I am familiar with) it just hadn't occurred to me in regard to gaming, but hey, you learn something new every day right?<br><br>Going back and looking at other games after having worked with DBPro has been a real eye-opener. I see a lot of tricks and shorcuts that I would never have noticed before.<br><br>But as for my framerate issues; right now I'm just practising, but I do have a project I intend to do with BB3D, and I want to use a fixed framerate system. The reasons are too many to explain here, but mostly it's due to the fact that I'll be "cheating" a lot of the animation using some very old 2D tricks and lookup tables etc.<br><br>Delta Timing won't work for this project since I have to coreograph every 3D and 2D animation according to a strict number of frames. My concern now is, what framerate should I pick? The lower I pick, the more effects and animations I can cram in, the higher I pick, the smoother it will appear but the less I can do with it.<br><br>Thoughts?<br><br>The game is an action-rpg (diablo) with slightly slower combat, using a "round"system (NWN) but with robot, so there will be lots of weapon effects and particles (which is why I need to cheat some of the effects by using 2D animation overlays)<br><br>What kind of framerates do you guys feel are acceptable for an action-rpg? (I mean WoW sometimes chugs below 20fps on my system and it's still playable, but on the other hand, when I finally got FarCry to hit 50fps with a ton of tweaks, it was sooo nice).<br><br>Yes, I am a framerate whore (sigh) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I don't think there is anyhting you plan to do which would not work with it.  Even if your characters are geosprites (a set of fixed 3d meshes each of which represents one frame of animation, as used in Quake 1) there's no reason why you can't move them smoothly through the world while changing the frame of animation being displayed at a fixed rate.  Sure, the animation might display a frame a tiny bit learly or a tiny bit late, but only a tiny bit.  You wouldn't notice the difference.  Of course you WOULD stil notice that the animation is choppy.<br><br>As for what framerate to choose if you want to do a fixed framerate system, I can't really offer you a concret choice.  It depends on your needs and what you are going to do.  What the lowest system you want to support is.<br><br>The higher the framerate the more frames you need for 2D animations or geosprite animations.  The memory costs for this can quickly grow.<br><br>If memory isn't an issue, then what you could do is make your animations run at 60fps, and then on low end computers drop every other frame if the PC can only render at 30fps, or drop every third frame if it can only render at 20, and every fourth if it can only render at 15.  With a framerate of 30fps, then you're really limited to only 30fps or 15fps, neither of which are very smooth.  And if you use 45 fps, then you're stuck with only 45 fps.  <br><br>You also need to consider how fast the monitor refreshes though.  A monitor might refresh at 60, 65, 70, 72, 75, 80, or 85hz.  Those are the most common rates as far as I know.    I think the standard right now is 85hz though. <br><br>The reason you need to consider this is because if you wait for the vertical refresh when flipping then you have to wait for the monitor.  And if the monitor runs at a different refresh rate than your game, then you might end up running at a lower FPS than normal.<br><br>For example, if I have a 3D game, and I am using delta time, but also using flip true, then even though my game could in theory run at 60fps, if my monitor updates at 85hz, I might find that my game is only actually running at 42 fps because it keeps having to wait for the monitor and wastes half a frame waiting for it every other frame.<br><br>There is no real way to solve that problem that I know of, other than to turn off waiting for the vertical refresh, but that can lead to tearing.  On monitors at least.  I don't know how LCD screens react to it.<br><br>Anyway, as you can see there are a lot of issues to consider.  I personally use Delta Time with a max framerate limiter so I can give some CPU time back to windows.<br><br><textarea class=codebox name="code" wrap=OFF readonly="true" rows="15" cols="80">

Places like Wal Mart want $500 PC's to sell, and Wal Mart gets what they want.  Microsoft on the other hand was charging too much for Windows XP, and it was preventing this price point from being reached.  So Wal Mart was talking about using Linux instead.  Microsoft probably quickly reduced the cost for OEM's to put XP on systems so that they  could reach the price point Wal Mart wanted.<br><br>Do you have Wal Marts in the UK?  Do you have many of them?    Maybe that is why your prices havan't dropped as much? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
