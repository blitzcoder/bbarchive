Problem is there is a point say when enemies are chasing me, that they all group up and then start to synchronize with each other so to speak.  It work great if you kill them one at a time but if more than one chases then the problem is apparent.<br><br>What I need is to use types to create the enemies, then somehow still have the ability to reference them individually or compare one "type" to another of the same "type".  <br><br>Wowww is that clear or not, I hope so. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It'll make the game less predictable and help avoid everything walking in lockstep.<br><br>one nice thing about 3d is not having to compute how to move away (angles to 2d), you just change the direction a character faces by a few degrees.  i'm loving the 3d right now.<br><br>wouldn't mind seeing what you are trying to do, it would help.<br><br>it sounds like you are using a relatively simplistic method to have your types chase your guy, which i'm guessing is to turn to aim at him and move towards him.  you probably want to make that more complex.  there would be some parameters controlling how the enemy chases - how fast he turns towards the player, how far he can see (so that he chases only if the player is within his range of vision), how fast he moves, etc.  if you give each enemy slightly different tweaks of these parameters, you'll start to get different behaviors out of them and they won't be able to clump up.  Add a lot of simple behavior parameters to your types, is one suggestion.  a lot of simple differences can add up to a significantly different behavior. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
