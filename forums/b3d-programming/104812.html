It is a compile-time statement. It doesn't even exist at runtime, let alone have the ability to change what it does.<br><br>This means that if you want your players to be able to mod the game using Included files, they will actually need to completely recompile it from source. Now this isn't necessarily a problem, especially since Blitz3D is now free (so redistributing stuff that relies on the compiler is OK - you can even redistribute the compiler itself), but it isn't what people generally assume you mean by "mod", which normally implies tweaking some additional files and often not even needing to relaunch the program or level.<br><br><br>The second strange thing about what you're asking is - Blitz3D is quite a static language. You write code that pulls in <i>known</i> commands from other parts of the program. How would the host program use this folder if it doesn't know anything about its contents? It wouldn't know what to refer to in order to actually make use of what the player defined there.<br><br>The closest I can suggest in this respect would be that you have one "known" include file in the mods folder, e.g. "mod-main.bb", and this file is <i>required</i> to provide definitions for a fixed set of functions, e.g. SetupGame, RunGame, etc. But the static nature of Blitz3D means that if you do this, you have to put the default definitions of those functions in view in the mods folder too. Blitz3D doesn't have a mechanism for speculatively choosing between pieces of code, so for your users can only add something where it's already expected, and that means it has to exist and be replaced. This... could end up being a big mess.<br><br><br>The more widely used solution for modding is to have the mods run in a separate piece of code somehow. They could be compiled to DLLs and loaded at runtime by your program via CallDLL, or they could be interpreted by a scripting engine you build into your program, but either way they don't actually form part of the main game binary. This allows hotswapping without needing to recompile, and allows you to choose between extension options without needing to expose the guts of your game proper.<br><br>Try searching the forums for "scripting" to see examples of the more conventional ways people have handled this in the past. There are some good existing solutions out there. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Everything has to have <i>exactly one</i> definition in the program (with one exception: you can override builtin engine commands like "DrawImage"). You can't supply definitions earlier and have them take precedence over definitions later, as the compiler won't know which ones to use. The language simply doesn't have the notion of optional code content or multiple implementations.<br><br>Other languages like Python may provide the feature, but Blitz3D simply wasn't set up for it. Hence the separation of categories between "scripting" and "main program" that doesn't need to exist in those languages.<br><br><br>Also RemiD's point is a good one. For the vast majority of low-key modding, you don't need to change operational code at all. You only need to change data parameters, which mean either media or config files. Levels and items shouldn't require coding or scripting at all, because they aren't usually a part of the program anyway. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Check the toolbox and code archives sections of this website.<br><br>For DLL plugins you'll probably want to look at using the CallDLL function. The userlibs system that's more commonly used to inteface with DLLs is a compile time system (like the Include command) so it can't be altered once the code is compiled. And obviously you'll need a language such as C++, Purebasic, etc that can compile a DLL file. Blitz3D can't be used to make DLL files.<br><br>Sounds like you're trying to run a marathon before you've learned to walk though.
