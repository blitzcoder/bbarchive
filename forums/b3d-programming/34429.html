If you are in different countries it would depend on the country... heck in the USofA it depends on which state you get sued in. Texas has a newfound active dislike for nuisance suits... California has a different position where you can sue your hairdresser for a bad haircut.<br><br>That said. Even if you "make no profit" and "credit the designer" in the game you can still be sued and shutdown. <br><br>If you change the title and differ the maps and music and sounds etc...

But with C64 titles this wouldn't be the case, after all you can download pretty much all of the games released for free from the internet and then run them through an emulator: they don't seem concerned about that, otherwise I'm sure they would have shut down the site doing it.<br>Thanks again for everyone who posted, good to know I'm not the only one doing a retro game. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I quite a long night and several dead-end internet searches I finally found that he had become the Director of Game Production at another developers.  I sent him an email, and then sat back.<br><br>I have finally had a response from him today - I had decided to go ahead with the remake anyway as I had put in the email that he should get in touch if there were going to be any problems with me doing the work.  He said that he didn't hold the legal rights to the game anymore, and that Activision did, but he had no problems with me having a go at doing the remake, and wished me good luck with it.<br><br>So now all I have to do is all the designing, logic, mapping, 3d modelling, interfaces, etc, etc .....<br><br>Hopefully I might start to do a bit of a worklog once I have actually got somewhere with it. :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Don't connect yourself to the original game (except to say "I got inspiration from game X") and don't say you're doing a remake.  As long as you're only copying the concept of the game design (ie. not it's title or graphics) you should be okay.  The entire game industry is based on developing new games that are incremental changes from previous games.  And your statement "using new graphics and producing it in full 3D with a couple of extra twists to it" indicates considerably more changes from the original than a lot of games do.  Just going from 2D to 3D is generally more than enough to be a different game.<br><br>It's funny to think about really, that saying you're doing a remake is the tipping point.  Just picking one example, if Stainless Steel had said Empire Earth is a remake of Age of Empires they would have gotten sued, but because they said their game is a competitor there was no problem.  No difference in production of the game, just one word in their intent.<br><br><br>"What about "Trailblazer 2004"?  Do you think you could get away with that?"<br><br>That would be connecting yourself to the original game; I recommend against doing that.  From the sounds/looks of things, naming it "Trailblazer" would be the one thing that could create a problem for the game.  Other than that, it's just another of the slew of games about racing balls through a maze and avoiding obstacles.  Just look at "Marble Blast" on garagegames; they're fine and their title is actually kind of close to an older game of that type (Marble Madness.)<br><br><br>ADDITION: I just remembered an interesting example of the similar name thing.  There was an old Nintendo game called "Monster in My Pocket."  It was originally called "Pocket Monsters" but had to change it because that was too similar to Pokemon (that name derives from "pocket monsters.")  Apparently the small change to "Monster in My Pocket" was enough.  Of course, in their case the gameplay wasn't even remotely similar to Pokemon. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
