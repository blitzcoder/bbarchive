Ok - I can't believe I've actually held this long. I've been DYING to start a community project, and I sorta-kinda-not-really already have, it's just that it's somewhere else and not here. ANYWAY: I've been *dying*, I mean, actual on-the-ground dying to start a community project. I've always wanted to be the head of some sort of team. Some sort of group!<br><br>But it looks as if I'll never get there. But I've started this thread just IN CASE anyone wants to join my community project. As I said - I have held it in too long - so I am finally unleashing the powers within.<br><br>I've completely restarted my new project, and got it completely organized so many people can work on it at the same time. If anyone is already preoccupied with a current project, then, well, too bad. I guess my project won't really be as great.<br><br>But I really think I can do this. I've organized - I've typed stuff up, and I've programmed *almost* the entire base of the game. I really think I can pull this off.<br><br>Basically the game is a sci-fi FPS game, although it will be complete with vehicles such as tanks, cars, jeeps, missile trucks, and high-tech weapons.<br><br>The FPS will really take some work, and I'd love to make it a community project. If no one wants to work on it, that's perfectly OK with me. I can just crawl back into my lair coding in my dark room, slowly turning pale.....<br><br>Anyway, I was just wondering if ANYONE at all would be interested in programming and designing a full game. It would take much of the aspects of Halo (mainly just the weapons, the setting, and the vehicle functions), although it would be completely different. I really think we'd all have fun doing this.<br><br>So give me your opinions. I'm ready! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I say 'semi-infant' because there is a great deal of media (music, level mesh, animated character) and the new PPFNet code is fully functional FPS code base. All that really remains is getting media into it. <br><br>Of course you can add extra features like portals, LOD management, Single Surface Particles, Vehicles and simple Physics. It would be advantageous to build on top of the existing code.<br><br>I'm no longer Leading the project, however, I will backup any contributed content and update the WorkLog. BlitzScript3D will be my final contribution to the project.<br><br>PPF is just engine and its a good starting point. It can power Operation 600 or any other FPS Game.
