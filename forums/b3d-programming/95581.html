Please feel free to add anything here, just see it at some kind of brainstorming so crazy ideas are welcome as well.<br><br>I think I'm able to create such a beast of language.<br><br>So what should it have? Some points from my side:<br><br><b>double precision:</b> Well yes, I missed that really in BB3D, floating point precision enough in most cases but there are cases where you need that extra precision.<br><br>Question here is, how is the double type look like?<br>Float: <b>variable#</b><br>Double: ???<br><br><b>DX9+/OpenGL:</b> Clearly this is the main reason to create something new. BB3D is great, no question. I would even use it for new projects, BUT DX7 is the problem here as it's emulated on modern Windows versions. So it's not the question that BB3D would be enough for a hobbiest but that I don't start something that won't run on Windows 8 anymore.<br><br>Personally I prefer OpenGL as it gives the possibility to do something cross platform later.<br><br><b>Cross Platform:</b> Would be nice to have, no question!<br><br><b>Strict:</b> I really missed that! Hours of debugging just to see a typo in a variable name where the compiler just created a new variable on the fly. Uh dear! Strict is a MUST, but should be optional.<br><br><b>Types:</b> Actually I never like the way types where done in BB3D that much. Something like <i>typeA\field</i> is a bit hard to read, I prefer the C style <i>typeA.field</i> but that might be a matter of preferences. I just would include both possibilities with a switch in the settings to let you work with both.<br> <br>... more to come. Will edit more into this first posting! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If we could have Blitzmax style 2D support it would be great. <br><br>Also, the ability to import models from a variety of free modelling programs would be a huge plus, Blender 3D in particular. GLBasic supports the latest Blender so it must be possible to get something up and running for Blitz too. Not many people can afford to keep buying extra software most want an all in one solution.

I'll be honest, I groaned out loud when I saw the topic title, but by the time I'd read Xaron's post, I had been turned to intrigue.<br><br>First thing I'd have to say - and this is funny coming from me, since I've never used it yet, but I know it's where I'll end up - is that the dreaded OOP syntax really should be added. Whether everyone wants to use it or not shouldn't matter, it should still be a viable option. Look at it this way: you can theoretically still do "old-style" procedural programming (like B3D) in an OOP language. You CANNOT perform OOP in a procedural language (again, like B3D).<br><br>Next up is an odd question, because I don't know enough about the low-level specifics of renderers nor the state of the industry behind the scenes. Since DirectX7 has already fallen by the wayside into emulation, and is no longer a particularly viable <i>industry</i> option, how much life does even DirectX9 have in it before it suffers a similar fate? I ask this mainly because 9 is what, six years old now? Seven? And since it's already two versions behind the cutting edge, I'm just questioning how much breath is left in the ol' horse. This is not me dooming something before it's even started, I just want to know what's what.<br><br>Strict is definitely a must, even if it can be enabled/disabled. I haven't disabled strict in IDEal since the day I turned it on about three years ago; it's a life saver. The degree of strictness is rather subjective, though; I like strict right up to the point of case sensitivity, and then it loses my support entirely. I like my functions, variables and so forth to have capital letters in them; it makes them easier to read.<br><pre class=code>ThisIsAnUnnaturallyLongVariableNameToDemonstrateMyPoint</pre>is much simpler at-a-glance than<br><pre class=code>thisisanunnaturallylongvariablenametodemonstratemypoint</pre>Nevertheless, I don't want to have to keep fiddling with the Shift key every time I use that variable afterwards; this is where lack of case sensitivity is a boon to me. IDEal just slaps in the capitalization that I used for the declaration, every time the variable or whatever is called.<br><br>Double precision would indeed be sweet. Here's another thought, and I have no idea how useful or not it would be, nor difficult to implement, but: what are the chances of having 64-bit integers instead of the old 32-bit limit? There are times when I play around with various file manipulation ideas, and I'm never crazy about being limited to a 4GB filesize. There are also times when I want to perform large-scale calculations purely to get the results quicker than using a calculator (or even to get more digits) and although I worked out ways to perform math "the manual way" using strings instead of integers, it'd still be nice to have that extra breathing room.<br><br>As far as what symbol to use for the double-precision floats, might I suggest either the "@" symbol or the "&amp;" ampersand?<br><br>Multi-threading is becoming ever more useful in this day and age, so some decent threading support would be preferred, if not required. This does of course open a whole can of worms regarding how far you go to idiot-proof the system; personally, I say just make sure it's bug-free, and if people don't use it properly then it's their own fault. Look at <b>WritePixelFast()</b> and <b>ReadPixelFast()</b>; they can cause all sorts of oddities if used incorrectly. There have also been at least a half-dozen occasions where I've crashed the blitzcc.exe environment itself because of a gaffe in my coding; I'd never blame Mark Sibly for not forseeing my error, though. Some people will whine about it, but the ones worth catering to won't. ;D<br><br>DirectX vs OpenGL. Is there any reason that both couldn't be implemented? I know that BMax has the option to use one or the other at graphics initialization. Speaking of DirectX...<br><br>... Memory leaks. We all know that resetting the graphics mode with <b>Graphics</b> in Blitz (at least 2D and 3D, not sure about Max or Plus) causes a complete loss of textures and images, due to a DirectX memory issue. They basically just get "flushed." Also, in some circumstances (i.e. my computer) the entire 3D world gets emptied, all entities disappearing, even PIVOTS for crying out loud. I can understand that this is potentially a DX problem, and therefore can't be "fixed" as such. Here's a thought though: perhaps all the data loaded by the program (which, because of the use of handles instead of pointers, the environment would always have track of, yes?) could be "dumped" as binary into a RAM bank, then loaded back into its correct memory allocation after the graphics mode changes? Not sure of the viability, much less the speed, but it's something to consider.<br><br>Oh, and of course, 3D acceleration for 2D imagery. I understand that this is native in everything DX8 and beyond, but I'm just putting it out there. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Unlike say making a custom QuickIf() function, however, this operator is still "lazy" - like regular If, only the branch that's relevant gets evaluated, and the other never happened.<br><br>Anyway, since we have two kinds of "If" in Blitz3D - line If and block If, where a line If swallows all statements on the same line and ends with the line terminator - I thought it might make sense to allow the line If form to function as a ternary operator, as long as the compiler detects no imperative command statements in its branches.<br><br>(Having block statements return values is not illogical in its own right - check the Ravioli link for an exploration of that - but certainly not BASIC-ish at all, so I would only suggest it for the line If form.)<br><br>Sorry this seems to have turned into a derail, but perhaps that explains some of the logic behind the suggestion.<br><br><br><br>---<br><b>EDIT:</b> Ooo, I thought of a couple more things:<br><br> - Don't forget the stepping debugger! I would argue that B3D's single greatest feature was that it introduced n00b programmers to "proper" debugging tools. This is also probably harder to write than the actual compiler... but I think it's where a lot of the value lies. (The simplest method I can think of is to keep the original source loaded in memory and attach text marker tags to the debug build of the application to tell the debug window where to highlight text.)<br><br> - Since you seem to be settled on compiling via C, would it be possible to make use of C's "static" keyword? For the non-C-programmers, "static" in the declaration means a name is not exported from the current module, so it would let you have "private" helper functions, and global variables, and such, inside library Includes, without worrying about name collisions. (Note that B3D Includes are more like modules than C-style #includes anyway, as each file only gets Included once per application - so it would be easy to represent libraries as separate .o files.) You could have it like BlitzMax: "Private", and everything below that line is invisible outside the file. Or similar.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I clean forgot about offering to help with the compiler!<br><br>It's probably too late to be of any use now, but if you're interested, I spent a few delightful hours (I <i>like</i> compilers) writing up a parser for B3D, which you can download here: <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/46635275/BitsParser.rar" target="_blank">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/46635275/BitsParser.rar</a><br><br>Run it with "Bits Test0.bb &gt; parsedoutput.txt" to get a pretty-printed AST. Source is included, but you'll need the Gambit-C compiler if you want to modify it. Note that it's <i>only</i> a parser (so it will accept <i>semantically</i> wrong programs), no type checking, linking, or C code generation, but those could be added fairly easily as they're really not that hard.<br><br>The grammar it's based on is included in the archive. There are a lot of weird bits in B3D! (e.g. I never knew that inline-If forms could contain block statements, or that Object, Handle, Abs and Sgn were operators rather than functions, before going looking for edge cases!)<br><br>The only form I know of which this doesn't support is the ability to leave off block closers when a scope completes, because 1) I couldn't work out the ridiculously complex rules for that, and 2) it's horrible and should be treated as an error in regular-B3D. (Of course it's probably full of bugs, but the test cases work correctly.)<br><br>I know, too late. Ah well, it was fun to build.

It's a unary operator, like Not, Int, Str, First, Last, etc., so it only takes one following argument and returns its value to whatever is in front of it:<br><br><pre class=code>Local obj.Foo = Object.Foo 42    ;Note that parentheses aren't required here - most people use them anyway

obj = Last Foo    ;Commonly seen without parentheses
obj = Before Last Foo   ;...etc.

Local i% = Handle Object.Foo Handle Object.Foo Handle Object.Foo 42    ;Silly but technically valid
</pre><br><br>There's nothing stopping you using parentheses, but because the compiler considers the meaning of these words "inherent" it can correctly decipher the expression anyway. It also means you can't define object or handle as variable or function names.<br><br>I'm starting to have the sneaking suspicion that the original B3D was implemented without being properly formally-defined first, as working out the grammar backwards is ...hard.<br><br>Also, the above silly examples highlights a bug with my parser.

But for now I would never recommend to start with a language like Blitz3D<br><br>Blitz3D was one of my first programming languages and it was hard to get away from it, but once you start coding in C# or C++, you'll see that it's much better. All these languages are strongly typed and also have doubles and whatever you need. The only thing missing is a built in 3D engine tho.

If it were strongly typed, it wouldn't permit casting of pointers or objects. Casting removes any pretence at type safety: in fact, B3D actually has a <i>stronger</i> type system than C++, since casting is impossible (which it then ignores and uses int-as-void* for everything, but the type system is at least present). C# on the other hand has a more legitimately strong type system (there are still unsafe operations, but they are properly restricted from the majority of your code).<br><br>Arguably however, any language that allows the existence of "null" is not strongly-typed, because the type doesn't properly define the behaviour of values. To get proper type safety you need something like a Hindley-Milner type system.<br><br>&lt;/totally offtopic&gt; <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
