And as Vertexcoords is really slow to begin with, it's clearly undesireable to use clearsurface instead, as moving vertcies is so slow that updating a mere 64K of them per frame even with the faster of the two methods, will drop your framerate like a rock.  You may lose 10fps or more per 64K vertices.  Update 10 terrain meshes, and do nothing else (not even render) and you might be looking at 12fps.<br><br>Regardless of whether updateworld is in the loop or not, the times remain the same.  This indicates to me that Blitz is not caching the changes, but rather is immediately updating the 3D mesh.  Otherwise, one would assume that the 3D model would be cached in ram until such time as an updateworld is called.  Then again, perhaps the mesh is not updated at that time, but rather only when renderworld is called.  I have not tested renderworld yet.  Even if I did, if the mesh is not visible to the camera, I suppose it's possible Blitz will not send the data to the card.<br><br>If Blitz isn't caching the data, I'd like to know why not.  And if possible, it would be nice to have something similar to lockbuffer for 3d meshes so that you can queue up a bunch of changes and then unlock it to make those changes take effect.<br><br>Here's my test code.

But I did not mean to imply that one should create a bunch of meshes at the start of the game for each type of particle and then let them sit there.  And even if you did, you could hide them.  <br><br>What I'd be more inclined to do is create a mesh when an emitter is created, and as particles are emitted, add vertcies and triangles to it as needed, reusing those which are no longer needed.  You'll reach a point of equilibrium for most effects where like a max of 200 particles are seen at once, and no more, at which point they fall off again.  When the emitter stops emitting, you delete the mesh.<br><br>I think that would work just fine.  Of course I'm simplifying things a bit.  Another optimization is to re-use those triangles which have moved offscreen, or too far from the camera as well.  Then if you have snow falling all over the level only those flakes near you will actually be using polygons.  The rest if the particles will just be simulated data. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I was talking about something EpicBoy was doing.  I just wanted to know how fast it was because I did try something like this when developing my current terrain system to dynamically weld tiles together and it was much too slow.  I thought maybe there was a faster way than what I was doing, but apparently not.<br><br>My current terrain system btw, does do LOD, but it uses a set of static meshes to do it.<br><br>I saw the pics of your terrain, and they look nice.  You did what I considered doing at one time... used ROAM to optimize the terrain rather than to update it in realtime.  I thought that would help with the performance of my terrain system.  But the sheer number of surfaces I had because my terrainw as divides up into a grid of entities, meant that that was much more of a bottleneck than the number of polygons.  So I never bothered optimizing further.  Besides, collisions were really slow when dealing with tons of entties with tons of polygons, so I needed to be able to interpolate the player's height instead of using collisions.  Also the changes in level of detial messed up collisions.<br><br>LOD for that reason is problematic, but if you want long view distances there's really no alternative to using LOD.  But you shouldn't use dynamic LOD.  That's clearly too slow as this test shows.  Just use static meshes. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I did also mention that your mileage would vary considerably according to what you were doing and possibly your system and Blitz version.<br><br>I agree with your observation that Blitz seems to change vertex positions immediately rather than do them all together, which would be massively faster for this sort of thing. If vertices don't get updated in animated meshes until you call UpdateWorld, it seems logical to me that dynamic mesh deformation ought to work the same way.

I had spent more than 100 hours on optimizing my particle system ( which, by the way will be released soon ) and there is 20-30% difference in performance between them. As sswift said, the best option is to combine those two methods. And, very important - if particles change colors ( or alpha ) over life, then you must use VertexColor in addition to AddVertex every frame, and vertexcolor is very "expensive" too.
