What I'm trying to do is use an existing Poser mesh and get it to animate as well as it does in Poser.  Have you had luck getting Poser-quality (i.e. Poser's idea of &quot;low-poly&quot;) meshes with flesh/clothing to animate well in Blitz?<br><br>You mention playing with the weights in CharacterFX: does the .b3d format take weights into account?  I'd read that it uses rigid assignments from a single joint rather than multiple weighted ones (and in the case of multiple ones, just assigns the strongest one).  I haven't tested this, however.  Have you verified that weights are used in .b3d models?<br><br>Please reply, even with uncertain findings.  If you've found a better way to do any of this, I'd love to learn the details.  This is new territory, and I'm just feeling my way along (no doubt making mistakes as I go).<br><br> ---<br><br>As for moving the mesh, rather than moving the skeleton joints, I did a quick redo of Skeleton Man, and it looked much the same animating in Blitz as the first version (though the collarbones seemed a bit off).  I also tried redoing Casual Man, quickly assigning mesh groups to joints with the same name in MilkShape, rather than doing vertex assignments in CharacterFX.  I'd previously tried this in MilkShape, and while it was *much* faster to create, it didn't look as good: the joints showed right-angle bends rather than smooth curves.  While I saw these same artifacts in the redo (as expected), the overall joint movement didn't seem noticably different (which is what I was looking at).  So, further testing seems required to verify if moving the BVH skeleton really is a no-no. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The &quot;intensity&quot; of the motion can be increased, decreased, or even reversed (going too far in either direction produces bizarre results).  This shows how a .B3D model can copy another's animation instead of using its own.  It also shows how models with different names for the joints can be used together (in this case, the two models use the same names, but if they were different, changing the names used by FindChild would make them both refer to the same joint).<br><br>The second demo (Dance duplicate) shows Skeleton Man copying dance animation from a simple cube.  I needed some mesh in the scene to convince MilkShape to export the file - it wouldn't export just a BVH skeleton/animation, but the cube serves no other purpose; the BVH isn't even attached to it.  This is a quick &amp; dirty way to import BVH animation without writing a Blitz loader (the cube could be hidden).  It also shows how animations can be modified in Blitz: the arms were too far back, so TurnEntity is used to move them forward.<br><br>In both of these demos, the head and hands can be enlarged/reduced in size, just for fun. :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
