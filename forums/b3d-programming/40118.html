Each mesh entity has a minimum of one surface. Now what you can do is create one mesh entity which contains the vertex and triangle data for more than one object. Eg: ten little missiles could all be built as one model with the same texture, and therefore could all be made from one surface.<br><br>Now when it comes to moving these missiles independently, you can't use the entity commands any more, because the entity is all ten missiles now. So you have to use the vertex manipulation commands to move the parts which belong to each missile independently. You need a basic grasp of position, rotation and scaling around arbitrary points in 3d space, but it's not too complex. ( If my pathetic grasp of 3d maths can cope with it, it can't be too bad. )<br><br>Forget about brushes and UV's in relation to surfaces, as there is no real relation, except that you can only have one brush per surface as you can only have one texture.<br><br>Brushes are simply materials. A collection of properties which sets how the object looks. Color, texture, shininess, alpha.. all that stuff combined is a brush. In fact, you often need not use brushes if you don't want to, but it makes things neater.<br><br>UV's are the x and y coordinates of the texture. It defines how a texture is mapped onto an object. Each vertex has a u and v coordinate ( x and y on the texture ) Connect the three vertices which make up a triangle on top of your texture and you'll see which part of the texture will appear on that triangle when you apply the texture. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
