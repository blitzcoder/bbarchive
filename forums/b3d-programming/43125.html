It's pretty accurate in placing (x,y) and width/height(w/h) in screen coordinates, so it can be placed like a 2D box, but of course has all the attributes of being able to alpha,texture etc.. 
It also remains pretty accurate even with different CameraZoom values. 
I only cracked it today, so there's a long way to go. 

The only downside seems to be that you need a long CameraRange far value.

When you think about it there are basically four controls: A form, viewport, button, boundbox. For example, you have a standard button and toggle button. Both are buttons, but, the Event Behavior is different. <br><br>Click on a standard button with the pointer and it goes down, release the click and goes back up. Click on a toggle button and it goes down, release the click and it stays down. Click on it again, and release the click and goes up.<br><br>Checkboxes and Optionboxes are buttons too. The are group to together within a Boundbox or Form. Both behave like toggle buttons, the Event Behavior is slightly modified so that checkboxes can be checked individually with no effect on another, meanwhile option boxes undo the checked state of their 'siblings' in the group.<br><br>A Slider is a button too. Its event behavior is too move upon clicking within defined by a boundbox. The movement is calculated and adjusts a value based limits of the value, boundbox dimensions, and the sliders dimensions.<br><br>Viewports create display areas on forms. There job is to grab the image of the other controls and clipped within its dimensions.<br><br>This leads me to this. Why hasn't a 2D GUI Lib been developed based on these Four Controls. A GUI Lib that allows you to easily create these controls, define their event properties {behavior, display, sound, and action}, and combine them (parent-child or sibling relationship) to create more complex controls like dropboxes, listboxes etc.<br><br>Anyhows, just blabbing here at work because they stripped the PC's down and removed my Blitz3D:( <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It would work fairly well to make a master gadget abstract type/class.   Then, have abstract form, viewport, text, boundbox, and button types/classes that inherit from gadget.  Finally, classes inherit from these that give you specific controls like buttons, checkboxes, indicators, scroll bars, etc, etc.  Some more complex controls can inherit from gadget itself, and include references to say, a few boundboxes, some buttons, etc.<br><br>More ideas for gui libs would include autopositioning and autosizing, which is especially handy for cross platform gui libs that use native gui.  Makes custom gui easier to use as well, though.  There are different schemes for this.  Perhaps have definitions of pixel borders around specific controls, or elements inside controls.  For instance, you could have a "Autoposition" control that positions all controls that are members of it so that they have a set amount of borders between them.  For instance, have a horizontal autoposition control across the top which has 2 vertical autoposition controls as members of it.  All the horizontal one knows is that one comes before the other.  The code would figure out the maximum width of each control inside each vertical positioner, and figure out the x positions for them.  Then, the vertical positioners will figure out there children's control's height and position them all spaced out with proper borders.  Then, size of the whole structure can be returned, so that other controls may be placed around it.  This idea is very extensible and a nice way to line everything up.  Especially cool is using it in conjunction with autosizing, which sizes controls based on their content.  This works with alot but not all controls.  You can also have the form itslef autoresize to accomadate controls.<br><br>GUI tech certainly hasnt been totally explored. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There are 3 types of rectangle areas: image -&gt; boundbox  -&gt; portal. <br><br>We all know what the definition of a image is so lets look at the definitions for boundboxes and portal.<br><br>The boundbox is used to perform collision detection with a pointer device.  Pointer <i>Events</i> is the detection of collision and input by the Pointer within a bounds during collision. Pointer Events: PointerOver, PointerClick#, PointerOut. <br><br>Some may wonder why I use the word Pointer instead of Mouse. Its a generic term for the screen pointer as it may controlled by a keyboard, mouse, or joystick.<br><br>The portal is a boundbox the performs collision detection with images and other boundboxes. Images and boundboxes within its area are clipped. Portals are very useful for displaying several images and performing several boundbox checks within a small area on screen. In 3D a camera entity is used to represent a portal. portals <br><br>Simple Gadgets<br><br>Gadgets are objects contain a boundbox, images, and other properties used to control, communicate between the user and application. Gadgets use images to display its <i>state</i>. In most cases the state of a gadget is controlled by its pointer event or another gadgets state.<br><br>There are 4 simple gadgets: PushBox, ViewBox, Boundbox, LabelBox, InputBox<br><br>Composite Gadgets<br><br>Composite Gadgets are assembled from simple gadgets.

I didn't support that out of the box with my own GUI system because if someone wants to do something like Metroid Prime, in my opinion, the best way might be to maybe hack a gui system like mine to render to an image and then use that image on a model of a helmet which you place over the camera.  The 3d buttons you see in the interface might as well be sprites that just look 3D. <br><br>Or the best way might be to create a single object with a single surface for the face of the helmet, and texture all the elements in that surface with bits of the main texture, and actually deform the shape of the object to fit the curve of the helmet.<br><br>It's not possible to cover all situations, and corvering lots of them might result in a lot of messy code.  So I just kept things simple in my own system since I could not really predict what the user might want.<br><br>Oh and another thing you could do... <br><br>Another way to render an interface like that would be to do what my GUI system does and render the interface with a second camera... But in this case you'd set to FOV of that second camera to be wider to create the fish eye effect to make it LOOK like the helmet is curved.  It might be hard to get that to look right though if you have a helmet you want to match up wuth the curved glass. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
