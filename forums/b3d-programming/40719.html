The solution would almost certainly require some native interface in something like C or C++ that JAVA could interface with.  JAVA does support native interfaces, so yea it can be done in a sort of left handed way.  The question is why?  There is nothing Blitz offers that is not presently available in JAVA, well short of the syntax and a couple things Ill mention later.  There is even good 3D support and some entity support for JAVA now.   <br><br>Im guessing this is to enable the use of JAVA code in Blitz, somthing like a scripting language?  If so, Id say your <br>going the wrong way, you could fairly easily port most Blitz Commands into native JAVA, so making a Blitz Script in JAVA would be my approach to this.  The hardest part would be the parser.<br><br>On a side note, I did a speed test on JAVA3D with my underwater fog demo and there was no visable speed change to what Iv got in Blitz so far with debugger off( since both use hardware acceleration ).  However, JAVA supports OpenGL and optionaly DirectX9, today.   Dealing with the JAVA3D Object Tree takes some getting use to, but it really makes since after a while, or you become brain washed enough to just do it and not think about it.<br><br>To be fair, Blitz is alot easier to setup for 3D than JAVA3D, and the built in entity support in blitz is awesome, but in just about all other ways JAVA is rapidly becoming the better language for games, IMHO.   I normally only use Blitz to prove concepts that I later recode in JAVA.  This is even starting to change as more and more JAVA3D tools are starting to roll out.<br><br>There are already several games in heavy use  coded in JAVA.  If Im not misstaken that Realm whatever game in the UK is one. :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Bellbrook got 1st in the division!!!* :D<br>so.... just disregard this thread whoever else reads it... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
