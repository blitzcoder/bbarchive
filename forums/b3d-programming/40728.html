The question was posed what language was easiest to learn.  A few said basic, I said your first one, and there were the usuall JAVA and C/C++ cries somewhere way off in the crowd.<br><br>After much debate about witch basic was easiest they turned to me, knowing Im a Blitz Basic Fan and asked me what I meant by "your first one".  My replay was simple, all be it a bit more complete, "The easiest programming language is the first one you try to learn.".  Well after being laughed at I asked them each what was the easiest language for them to learn, with very few exceptions, BASIC.  Then I asked them what was the language they first learned to use, and with even fewer exceptions, BASIC.  Ironicly the JAVA guys were mostly C or C++ converts, and moving from C++ to JAVA is fairly simple, so naturally they found JAVA very easy to learn.  <br><br>A study was done in the early 1980s by a University in the Washington DC area on this very subject.  Unfortianatly, I have forgotten the schools name ( maybe Georgetown U ).  Anyway, they took several new Computer Science studants, seperated them up into language classes.  One group was given ASM, the next BASIC and yet another PASCAL.  After a period of time ( I beleive a semester ) they switched the studants and what they found was really quite interesting.  It seemed that the ASM studants picked up Basic or Pascal very well. Meanwhile, Basic and Pascal studants struggeled with ASM or BASIC ( for Pascal ) and ASM or PASCAL ( for basic ).   Even though the ASM studants performed well, when surveyed they said ASM was alot easier than PASCAL or BASIC to learn.   The study was repeated a few times and the results stayed constant.<br><br>So, if your thinking BASIC will be easier to learn than say JAVA or C++ you may just be fooling yourself.  Choosing a language while your mind is free of preconceptions of how things should work is the best time to look for something a bit more versitile.   As my dad always said, "shoot for the stars, after all, you can always ketch the moon on the way down.".  In fact, if the study has any merrit it would imply learning a, so called, high level language might actually cause you more grief later down the road.<br><br>So what do you think? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Some Basic Variants may be fine, as well as ASM, Pascal, Modula, C, C++, Java. I think it doesn't matter that much what language you are using, byside the question if a compiler can satisfy your technical needs. What really counts is the documentation, concerning the learning curve. You can have a Basic that is complicating things horribly, and in the same time you can have an easy start with C++ or ASM when you have the right Books.<br><br>I started Programming with Omicron Basic that came bundled with the Atari ST and it was not only a good Basic, it also had one of the best Manuals I have ever seen. Each command was explained with a very tiny example that actually could be tested. <br><br>If you once know one programming language, you pretty much know all of them, so you may learn Basic first and you'll understand Java easily IF you had a good start with Basic.<br><br>So I found the Docs of Qbasic miserable, but I had my knowlegde from other products, so it wasn't a problem, byside some hardware specific aspects. BlitzBasics Docs may also not be the final Superlative in the Art of Documentation and it may be kind of hard to get into for complete newbies, but it also isn't that bad, since Blitz offers a lot of commands and power, it's only natural that it may take a little longer. On the PC Platform it is one of the easiest that I know, that offers this kind of up to date power. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You also form preconceptions during this time.  You naturally assume things happen this way or that and thats what really hurts people later as thy try to equate new ways of doing things with the ones they know.  Example:  Many BASIC programmers find C's string manipulations lacking, but in reality its far more versitile than most BASICs at that very thing.  While PERL is arguably the best for manipulating strings( a task it was designed to do), many BASIC programmers find it far to complex.  This is not that BASIC coders are stupid, they are simply used to the BASIC way of things.  Thats the comfort some talk about.<br><br>Chatty - Don't let JAVASCRIPT throw you, its not JAVA, not even really all that close now days.   If your school is using JACASCRIPT ( a goofed up language that barowed the name JAVA just as a marketing ploy and was, I beleive, created by NETSCAPE) to prepare you for real JAVA programming then I would think about going to another school.  There is nothing in JAVASCRIPT that makes leaning JAVA any easier.   However, it is a OOP language, so perhaps that is the goal.  Still there are far better OOP languages they could have chosen than JAVASCRIPT, many of witch are far more OOP in nature.  Perhaps PYTHON or some such.<br><br>For me, my favorite language and easiest to use at the time was TURBO C back in the mid 80s.  I had learned BASIC as my first language but had been coding in ASM in 6502/6510/Z80/Z8000/TI9900/6800/68000/8080/8088 for so long that I had basicly been cleansed of the hole BASIC way of things, and C was sort of a natural step up from ASM.  What made TURBO C my favorite was it was the first IDE I got to use, no more EDIT for coding and DUMP tools for debugging. :)  <br><br>I sometimes forget how much fun, all be it almost equally frustrting, it was to code in those minimalistic systems where 64K was the cats meow.  Now days good code is anything that runs, back then it had to run in less memory than it was possible to put it in.  :)<br><br>To me, the Atari ST was a fantasic machine, I started with the TI 99/4A and a EAGLE CPM machine.  Later got a C64 then a Atari ST, created my first net(over serial) capable game on the ST that used a server based in PBBS ( over dialup modems ) that was a text based galactic game(think old text based Star Treck sim, multiplayer) witch could handle upto 32 people at once, provided the BBS supported that many connections.  When I got my first PC in 85, I quickly realized that the other consoles were soon to be dead ends and pretty much stuck to the PC.  Hard choice when you went from 256 colors to 16 colors.  <br><br>Now here we are 20 years later, the languages for me are BASIC and JAVA, I have seen no reason to code in C++ short of meeting requirments by a few customers.  My language set is insane now, having to know everything from PERL to ASM to JAVA and be able to work profesionaly in them.  Still I stick to Basic and JAVA as much as possible.  My beleif is that BASIC, while full of ways to poorly right good code is a very fast language to get something up and running in. While JAVA is far more suited to making something stable, plenty fast enough and easily extended( witch is handy when having to deal with customer feature changes and add ons).<br><br>I do have some of advise for any language you may choose to use( 7 golden rules ):<br>1) Use Functions, Procedures, Subroutines or whatever your chosen language provides you to break up your code into managable chunks aka modules.  <br>2) Always take the extra time to do it right the first time. Don't race to a new function becuase you just got this great idea, simply stop codeing, put the idea in a text document and go back to what you were doing.  This has the benifit of later letting you look at the idea before spending hours coding it to see if its really such a good idea, or could be done better some other way.   You may even need to get up and do something else after putting this to paper so you can get back on track with what you were doing. <br>3) Always try to define variables ahead of time, in some languages this is a must anyway (C, JAVA, etc) but in most basics its not.  I know many BASIC fans think this is a lot of nonsence, but a simple misstyped variable name, or cryptic ones with no comments make debugging a real nightmare in any project of size.  <br>4) Always be aware of the SCOPE of a variable as you define it.  Don't just make everthing GLOBAL.  Again this can be a real debugging nightmare when you use the same vaiable name in some function 2000 lines later.<br>5) Never be affraid to ask for help, not even on the easy things.  No matter how many years you have been coding you will never know it all.  Even though some of us think we do.  :)<br>6) Related to 4, always thank those who help you.  It goes along way to getting more help later, especially on those really complex problems, you know like doing reflections with 3 light sources in a simulated fog with lens flair. <br>7) I also save the most important for last, COMMENT YOUR CODE!  I don't care if its a 10 line loop test or what, no comments will kill any project faster than any amount of complexity.  The more people who work on the code, the more important the comments become.  I tend to go overboard with mine, as I usually include everything from variable and function description to whole sections on why I do what I do and what ideas pop into my head to do it another way.  While I like this, some think it breaks up the code too much sometimes.   However, having no comments can make the best code nearly impossible to reuse, even by its own creator.<br><br><br>Ok Im sure there are more than 7, but these seem to be the most overlooked in my experiance.  :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'm sure it's a very nice language but it seems to originate in a unix environment and everything about it is stated in unix terms.  That would not only add a new layer of confusion for a newbie but it might make it more difficult to learn a second windows language with a native windows environment.<br><br>I'm not speaking against Python per se.

The person answering will usually answer in terms of their own experience.  My first language was assembly language which I learned back in the '60s.  I believe that learning assembly first helped me to be a better high level programmer.  But many, maybe even most, teachers of programming; even those who are very fluent in assembly; disagree that assembly is a good first language.  They may be right.  I may be right.  Who knows!<br><br>I personally think the best language for a person to start with is the one for which they have the most help from friends or teachers or books.

Where did you get that idea?"<br><br>When the sales of PC games went into decline over 2 years ago and have continued to decline.  Just take a look at any trade journal, or draw your own conclusion by visiting any store that actually deals in games.  Console game sales is where the money is, and there is a strong after-market for console games.  The PC will be around for a while as a tool for developers and there will be some games for it, BUT the console is presently, and will continue to be more so, the platform that most game producers are shooting for.<br><br>There was a time when most console games from major publishers had PC counterparts.  Today, that is a rare thing, and very few PC games, save those that have some special requirement that todays consoles just don't offer, are ported to the consoles.  These special requirments will not be a issue on the next gen consoles from Sony and Microsoft ( one can assume Nintendo will as well).<br><br>However, the SINGLE BIGGEST CLUE was the XBOX, why would a company who already has the Monopoly on the PC market even concider the Console Market if it did not pose some form of real threat?  Why not just make all those killer titles for the PC instead?  It would have saved them Millions and the profitts would have been just as good.  The reason is that Microsoft is smart, they may be many things but not dumb, and are addressing the threat now, before it turns into another Netscape or JAVA on them. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
