I was using Siblings, eg:<br><br> i  a  o  u  e<br>bi ba bo bu be<br>ci ca co cu ce<br>di da do du de<br><br>etc., plus of course a set of all chars in "standalone" form: T! B! P! ...<br><br>Because all we say is made of siblings, eg. If you try to assemble siblings "on the fly", it will sound bad, eg: moh - the m fades smoothly to oh, so you cannot assemble it from a M and a O.<br><br>Well, however, I didn't continue the project because I had to handle about 100 Soundfiles, and they loaded extremly slow. I even don't know why they loaded so slowly, it took 2 Minutes or so only to load the OGGs.<br><br>When there was a way to save all siblings in one soundfile and then play them individually, then it might be an option.<br><br>Even with a complete set of all possible siblings you still need a lexicon with some kind of "byte-code" that helps to spell things right. So the app may interprete a world like "Station" as "Steh-shon".<br><br>It's a lot of work and if there were any good, free and easy to use speech solutions out there, I would use them instead. Windows comes with speech, at least since XP, and it should be possible to use it with userlibs. If I recall correctly then there's even an example in the code archives, I guess in section userlibs or sound. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This requires some user reaction analysis. If the user hast to do unnatural actions just to signal that he's there (eg. when he has to press Space ) then the interaction may not work as desired. The interaction must be very easy for the user. And even then, the AI takes a lot of interaction time to learn what is successful behaviour and what not. Just like a baby, when it says the first word, it will get a lot of attention from the parents - and this attention is one of the basic needs of a baby.<br><br>An other idea would be: the AI must try to make the user laugh. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
