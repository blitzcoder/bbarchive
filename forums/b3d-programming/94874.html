    Field Name$
    Field Kid.Child
End Type

Type Child
    Field ParentName$
End Type</pre><br><br>This would be followed later in the code by something like:<br><br><pre class=code>Thing.Parent = New Parent
    Thing\Name = "Derp"
    Thing\Kid.Child = New Child
        Thing\Kid\ParentName = "Derp"</pre><br><br>The main use for this, THEORETICALLY, is that it allows you to create a LIST of fields within a Type, without it having to be a preset number. Say, for example, that you wanted to make a bunch of planets, so you make a Type for them. Then, each planet can have moons, but you don't know how many. You could do something like:<br><br><pre class=code>Type Planet
    Field Moons[100]
End Type</pre><br>Trouble is, what if you wanted MORE than 100 moons? Also, if you have LESS than 100 moons, you'll have to have some sort of marker - probably 0 - to designate which elements of <b>Moons[x]</b> do NOT contain entities.<br><br>With nested Types, you should THEORETICALLY be able to make this nice and simple. You create a Type-in-a-field for each moon, for each planet. Like this:<br><br><pre class=code>Type Planet
    Field NumOfMoons
    Field Moon.Moon
End Type

Type Moon
    ;etc
End Type

;Planet creation here

For Planet.Planet = Each Planet
    For i = 1 To Planet\NumOfMoons
        Planet\Moon.Moon = New Moon
    Next
Next</pre><br>Nice and neat. You SHOULD now be able to loop through the planets, and for each planet, loop through its moons and ONLY its moons, like this:<br><br><pre class=code>For Planet.Planet = Each Planet
    For Planet\Moon.Moon = Each Moon
        ;Do stuff
    Next
Next</pre><br>Trouble is, it apparently doesn't work this way. Have a look at the following working experiment (no media needed):<br><br><textarea class=codebox name="code" wrap=OFF readonly="true" rows="15" cols="80">Type Parent

End</textarea><br><br>Now, as we discussed before, this SHOULD work. The program loops through all the <b>Parent</b> Types, then for each one, it loops through its <b>Child</b> Types. UNFORTUNATELY, the results in the program clearly show that instead, the loop counts through ALL the <b>Child</b> Types EVERY TIME. To fix, I put in a little <b>If</b> statement, shown here:<br><br><pre class=code>    ;COUNT THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN FOR EACH TYPE
    For Thing\Kid.Child = Each Child
        If Thing\Kid\ParentName = Thing\Name
            Children = Children + 1

    Next</pre><br>Run the example with THIS in there, and the child count comes out correct. However, this completely defeats the purpose of nested Types, since the exact same method could be using ORDINARY Types. This isn't a problem per se, but it means that for EACH of the parent Types, ALL the child Types will be looped through, even though only a few of them belong to each individual parent.<br><br>Am I missing something blatantly obvious here, or is this "nesting" method literally just a way of making code a little more "readable?"<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font><br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I don't think you've correctly understood the B3D type system.<br><br>First things first: let's clear up some terminology, so that there's no confusion. The Blitz3D manual gets a lot of the terms <i>wrong</i>, which makes Types a difficult topic to discuss clearly.<br><br> - A <b>variable</b>: a name in the program that can hold a value. You know these from ints and floats.<br><br> - A <b>type</b>: a property <i>of a variable</i> that determines what data it can hold. There are four main types in Blitz3D: ints, floats, strings (you know these three), and pointers. A type can also be a property of an <b>object</b>, describing its memory structure. These are separate concepts, but they map 1:1 in Blitz3D so let's say that they're one thing: type forms an exclusive link between a memory structure and a variable that can hold it or a reference to it.<br><br>In either case, the concept is purely abstract and doesn't exist in any form at runtime. There is <i>no way</i> to "nest" types (notice above how you defined "Child" below "Parent", not within the same block).<br><br> - An <b>object</b> is a block of memory. You create a new object with New and free it with Delete. Entities and images and whatnot are also objects, but they don't have any role in the B3D type system (but they're useful to keep in mind as they can help you understand by-reference semantics).<br><br> - An <b>instance</b> <i>of a</i> type is an object whose memory structure matches that type's pattern description, and was created with the New operator for that type. The main distinction between the terms "object" and "instance" is that "instance" is used to refer to an "object" of one specific type. (Note that the machine doesn't actually know this at runtime - this doesn't matter to us though).<br><br> - A <b>field</b> is <i>exactly the same thing</i> as a variable; it happens to name a location inside a dynamically allocated object, instead of part of a function's frame or the main program's frame. So you have to "qualify" the location <i>within</i> that object: this is what the instance\field syntax means. Fields can also be called <b>member variables</b>.<br><br> - A <b>pointer</b> is what a variable stores to act as a <b>reference</b> to an <b>object</b>. Entity "handles" are pointers, converted to integer form to store in int variables; you will remember that when you assign one image or entity handle to another variable, it doesn't copy that image or entity; it just means two variables are referencing it. Instances of B3D custom types work the same way, except they can't interchange freely with integers they way "handles" can. Functionally, and at runtime, they are however exactly the same thing.<br><br>OK, that down:<br><br>When you store a "type in a type" as so many people on here erroneously call it, what you've done is declare a member variable within that type's structure. That member variable can hold an instance of whatever type you declared it with, <i>exactly the same</i> way as a variable outside can. This means that the value of that field will start as Null, and isn't constrained in any way by the rest of the type structure. Therefore, it can hold any instance of the right type. It's just a four-byte slot, same as an int variable, at runtime; assigning an instance to it is no different than assigning an entity to an integer field.<br><br>When you instantiate a type with New &lt;typename&gt;, it is added to a hidden "global list" of objects of that type. (This is... frankly an odd choice on the part of Mark, and isn't normal for most programming languages.) Elements of that list are controlled with the After, Before, First, Insert, and Last operators. When you use For/Each, you're iterating over the <i>whole</i> of that list, again without any kind of qualification or control based on where you're calling For/Each from. There is exactly one list per type, and all instances of the type go on that list, and you cannot create any other lists that work with For/Each.<br><br>So, to finally explain what's going on above: When you nest the two For/Each loops, the inner loop isn't controlled by the outer loop, as it describes something that the compiler doesn't know you want to be conceptually linked. Instead it loops over all the Moons, regardless of planet (You're also using Planet\Moon as an <i>iterator</i>, which means the value stored in that field is actually changing with each iteration of the loop - this is definitely not what you want to do!).<br><br>There are a few ways to do what you want, but the best is probably not to work with For/Each at all and instead control your loop manually. You could arrange the Moons in linear groups (you'd have to either create them in blocks for each planet, or rearrange them with Insert), and store in Planet the <i>first</i> Moon and the number of Moons; then you could set the iterator variable to that stored first Moon and use a For/Next loop over the number of Moons, manually incrementing the Moon variable with After.<br><br>Or you could avoid use of the global list altogether, and add a "nextMoon.Moon" field to the end of the Moon type; point this to the next Moon in the list and at the end of the loop, read the next Moon from that. When you encounter a Moon where m\nextMoon = Null, then you're done with that Planet. (<b>EDIT:</b> This is the "linked list" Warner describes above.)<br><br>...this was long and repetitive, but I hope it helps.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

A little convoluted for my brain that only got out of bed about twenty minutes ago, BUT I see how it works, and it's great. Funnily enough it's an amazingly similar principle to what I was doing using strings instead; the parent Type had a <b>\Name$</b> field, and the "child" Type had a <b>\ParentName$</b> field; I would then loop through the child Types, working on only the ones whose <b>\ParentName</b> matched the <b>\Name</b> of the active parent. A little clunky by comparison, and I realize strings are most likely much slower than direct-object-referencing, but for my present purposes it works because I never have to loop though more than about 100~200 possible parents and children TOTAL, and there's only ever one active "parent" at a time.<br><br>I'll keep a note of that object method though, as it may become useful should I need more elaborate nesting in the future.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

</textarea><br><br>So you'd do something like:<br><br>this.type = new type<br>this\name$="blah"<br>this\hash = fasthash(this\name$)<br><br>then in your loop you'd calculate the "hash" for the string you wanted to compare and use fastcmp to check them - if your only checking 2-3 strings then its slower - but not by any amount that matters - if your checking against say 200 strings then its ~40x faster.<br><br>EDIT: And not to sound like a petulant child... but can people please look at the sample I posted earlier (post #6) on how to do nested types as people keep posting hideously inefficent (relatively speaking) alternative methods.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
