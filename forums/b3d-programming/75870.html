BRLs adventures in the editor creation have not shown anything but rotten fruits. Maplet, once been sold, lacks that many of even basic features that I still ask myself who payed for it (beside Puki who seems to own a gold sh*** donkey). The default IDEs for all BRL languages so far show the same massive lack from the professional point of view. So I don't see that they "out of nowhere" learn how to create usefull editors and environments. Thats sad but a fact. Especially given the Fact that even the "simple" TGB had 3 programmers and a fully working base engine (TGE) + 18 months of work in it for its initial release and another 12 to its current, really good state ... mapped onto BRL this makes about 60 months, by that time they will have dropped it quite some time ago, as B3D <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Fast, stable, and runs fine on my old 8mb Savage3D card...7 years ago...<br><br>Throughout those years, I upgraded my graphic card twice. A friend had given me his old GeForce2 Ti 64mb and it allowed Cubic and Dot3 mapping. Many great things... When pix/vert shaders became a norm, since many games use it, I bought a GeForce 6200 256mb for $20. Many great things.... However, I was unhappy developing for it...BlitzMax was my only hope.<br><br>I used to come to this site everyday, looking for new things, updates, news, etc. and had high hopes for BlitzMax esp. Max3D. Until I was shocked to see Blitz3DSDK....I thought hard. Should I get the sdk or get Blitzmax...<br><br>I got the SDK instead....many good things...but it didnt last me for long. I had overlooked the main core features for the fact that it was still DX7...I can only do exactly the same things in B3D, a bit less. I guess I bought it because I've outgrown the basic language and move on something higher. <br><br>Its the year 2008. Other engines have become much better, supporting latest feature. Is B3D falling behind? Is this the end of B3D? Now that I have ditched my 7 year old computer, got a MacPro with 8800 GT card, programming for DX7 seems stupid....I mean really! I see that the average consumer has a much better computer with a better graphics card. As for the B3DSDK, I slowly had to let it go , alone, untouched, somewhere in deep folders in my harddrive to bit rot.<br><br>Now I use a popular opensource 3d engine called Irrlicht. It has what I needed that B3DSDK lacked: DX9 with shader support. On the plus side, it had more to offer: Multiplatform, Opengl, all kinds of 3d format including my favourite .b3d, and whats best it that it ALLOWED low-level file/data access that B3DSDK Load functions didnt have. It allowed me to load and stream resource files directly from memory instead of only string based file/path approach.<br>Honestly, it was like Blitzmax and B3D was combined when using Irrlicht...It offered many good things for free. I hear also that the engine has port to PSP and now the iPhone.<br><br>Now, I'm not saying BRL has lost another customer. I still look at these forums, I just don't program for it anymore. If BRL were to save itself and become on top again things has to happen:<br><br>-Get rid of DX7<br>-Consider DX9 as core renderer, or OpenGL 2.0 or both<br>-If OpenGL was used, it can now be freely a multiplatform engine.<br>-If it were to become multiplatform, then there is a reason for BlitzMax<br>-BlitzMax = BlitzMax IDE + B3D 2.0 (Max3d?) Integrated all in one. <br>-B3D has to be phased out esp. the syntax language. Just use BlitzMax language<br>-Having B3DSDK transitioned it much more easier to port it to BlitzMax which means,<br>-Existing B3D owners can upgrade to BlitzMax now enjoy the Blitzmax language with the ease of basic with 3D,DX9 features, etc.<br><br>The drawback is time and effort, and the whole software development cycle. It can be sped up by making the SDK open source community driven. Not free, but allow a license you can buy and download the sdk with source and any changes to the source must be put back up to the site that gets peer evaluated to becomes a revised version. As for the less technical programmers, they just buy BlitzMax for the sake of the language and IDE and get free engine updates as SDK members improve the engine since they only have access to the code.<br><br>So basically there can be two types of members:<br>-Regular (one just use BlitzMax to make games with basic)<br>-SDK member (has access to the source and and make changes and improve the engine itself as well as make apps). <br><br>Of course, SDK member would cost more but there are alot of people who are willing to pay for it.<br><br>Looking at these forums, its what people really want. And to me it would be a great thing, but its only what I could dream about. It may or it might not happen...I don't know.<br><br>-J <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I have tried many combinations, and couldn,t manage a 100% accurate compatibility.  I've come to the conclusion at s9ome point that the meshes that Blitz3d build internally can't be compatible with a stencil shadow system.  Unless someone can prove this wrong.  I would need help on this if it does work.  Someone wonce stated that I need closed meshes, and I understand the difference between a closed mesh and an open mesh.  But I am hardly going anywhere with my model generating system.  Finally I am counting on a CSG engine to help me out with this.  So, my problem is hardly because of Direct X 7.
