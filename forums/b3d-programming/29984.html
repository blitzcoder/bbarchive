But collision-wise, exactly the same as a FPS should be fine. It seemed relatively simple, but I don't much care for the result. <br><br>I've got Ellipsoid collisions for the player model, and polygon for the world. I've got it set so that the player doesn't slide back down slopes. It works up to a point, but it's very jerky around the bottom of slopes. The player just seems to reverberate if you move toward the side of a wedge shape at the bottom.<br><br>I loaded up Si's FPS example with the Gargoyle to see if it was just my code, but that demo does exactly the same thing. So is there a better way to do this with Blitz collisions? Or do I need to write my own again? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I use that pick to control jumps btw.<br><br>So if pickednx etc. signals that the slope under the players feet is steep and my char would actually slide down, due to gravity-y-decremention, i simply prevent sliding down the slope by repositioning the player at the last position AFTER updateworld. Of course, this should be done only when the player is not walking or running.<br><br>Not shure if this will solve your problem. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Sorry, mental flashback.<br><br>There are no steps at the moment, and I probably won't have any, but I'll take another look at the gravity to see if I can fix that. It's fairly floaty at the moment, but maybe a little less would help.<br><br>JFK : I don't think that it will stop the juddering I'm getting, but it's definitely good information. I've been toying with the idea of doing my own collisions. I think I would need five short linepicks to get full player / level collisions working, so if short linepicks are quite fast, that might be doable.<br><br>Failing that, I might have to give Nuclear Glory's collision DLL a test. It's apparently very smooth and very fast, so it could be just what I need.<br><br>Thanks guys. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

O.o<br><br>[Edit] With a linepick going straight down you can also modify the gravity force depending on the result of the pick.<br><br>If the pick is successful ( players feet are on the ground ) then use a very low gravity force.<br><br>If the pick fails then exponetially increase gravity ( up to a maximum ) until the player hits the ground again. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I don't really enjoy realistic physics myself and I don't want to make games that go down that route. I'm all about making games fun instead. I appreciate I'm in the minority, but everyone's gotta have a gimmick. Nuclear Glory's system on the other hand, seems to be similar to Blitz collisions, just better and faster.<br><br>Yeah, I like the idea of a linepick and adjusting gravity accordingly.
