Just reposition/fade them based on the information you have at hand at that point (probably fade them based upon 2D distance though).<br><br>Keep in mind, that could be highly inefficient, but this is the first thing that comes to mind for me.<br><br>Floyd: My take on the proposed situation was that he wanted to get the colors of whatever was in front of an entity in 3d space, which would probably require re-rendering the scene from the entity's point of view, which in turn would probably be slow if you did it 50 times. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

When the camera moves a certain distance away from the object, the object itself is destroyed but its data (perhaps r/g/b levels, ie. the intensity of the red (0-255) decides what object to put there, the blue decides the objects size for example etc.) remains. This way, theoretically, you could have tremendous numbers of objects that can be constantly updated through WritePixelFast easily (for example, the data (x/y values, object type and size as mentioned before)) for 1048576 objects within a simple 1024 x 1024 bitmap, all placed/destroyed through Read/WritePixelFast. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Then you can hold as much or little information as you want. Peeks and Pokes are much faster than readpixelfasts as you don't have to arse around with locking buffers... and of course you could use an array.<br><br>Of course if we're talking about saving memory it's a hugely ineffieciant way of going about it as you're storing information on objects that don't exist.<br><br>The other problem you've got is that objects will have to fall on the exact grid that depending on the size of your terrain will look clunky as hell.<br><br>If you're planning on having 1,000,000 objects then they way you're going about it is probably alright however, if you're only talking a few thousand objects quite frankly I think you're better off storing your objects in a type. This way the x,y,z is accurate and you're only holding information on the objects you have rather than what you don't have to. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Im not to keen on arrays etc., and I thought this might be a pretty unique and relatively very simple way of creating a lot of possibilities, especially if you are looking at really, really big numbers of entities (ie. 4 million or so by using only 4 1024 x 1024 bitmaps)...I will start writing something, hopefully this could be quite useful, as you could even be able to create a map of a whole country for example, one set of bitmaps is the visible map and the other stores the data via r/g/b levels. Does locking/unlocking buffers take up much power? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
