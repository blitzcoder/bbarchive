Probably too big for your graphics card to hold therefore it cant load it. So, having an entire suite in one texture is a bad idea.<br><br>What would be better is to have each card as a seperate texture - I assume you're not going to be showing all 52 cards at once so this way you'll only have to use the card textures that are currently in the game. <br><br>Also, most 3D cards only accept power of 2 sized textures (blitz would scale them for you when it loads it in, if its not) - so in this case, your 349x3109 would probably be scaled up to 512x4096, which is HUGE!<br><br>So, best you're best off making seperate textures for each card and make them 128x256 in size, load them all in at the start and as you create each card to display, assign the correct texture.<br><br>In the code you gave, you're first loading in a card, then calling PaintMesh on 'FRONT' even though FRONT doesn't exist, you can't label something in a mesh and paint it, not in blitz.<br><br>If you want to paint the front and back two different textures, then you can either build up a mesh in code with two surfaces and paint each surface, or load in two meshes and paint each mesh differently.<br><br>Personally, I'd build up a card mesh in code - its only 2 surfaces, each made up of 2 triangles. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So after scaling, and converting to 32-bit, this one texture will be 8Mb - Plus another 2.7Mb for mipmaps. So for all four suites, thats a grand total of - ~42.8Mb! (Thats not counting any meshes, or any other graphics in your scene)<br><br>Also, holding all the cards (or just one suite) in one texture won't help you either, unless your planning on showing all possible cards at once, because although it may save you on swapping textures when rendering, it will still upload the suite entire texture to the video card it would very slow if the graphics card couldn't hold all the textures in memory.<br><br>If you were to have a single texture per card, when it came to rendering it would only have to upload a bunch of smaller textures and only the ones it needed - therefore, much more likely to fit into graphics memory and more friendly to the texture cache.<br><br>As for making up a card of component parts, its really not worth the effort, and jokers, j,q,k would still need special texture parts. All that extra work, for parhaps a few less texture swaps for which you wouldn't even notice the difference in framerate - it's not like your rendering 1000's of cards at once (are you?!)<br><br>You can easily save out 52 images, at 128x256 8-bit palettized all that only comes up to about 1.6Mb on disk, which is nothing in the grand scheme of things. Then when all are loaded in and coverted to 32-bit, that would be 6.5Mb (8.67Mb with mips) held in normal RAM. Then when you want to render it and you had say, 10 different cards currently displayed in your game, that would only take up at most 1.25Mb of video ram (big difference from 33Mb!)<br><br>In a lot of cases, using a bigger texture made up of smaller textures works very well to speed up rendering and reducing texture swaps, but in this case - it's not. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Try loading in an image you know works, then keep increasing the size and number of frames until it breaks - then you'll know exactly what th elimits are. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
