You render the view of the 3d object from the current camera view, and determine if the angle or distance of the rendered image relative to the camera has changed enough that you need to re-render it.<br><br>Unfortunately, if you have a camera which can move around a lot, then you end up having to re-render the impostors almost every frame, which can cost you more than just rendering the object normally.  The ideal sorts of titles for using impostors are RTS games with a fixed camera viewing the action from above, or a flight sim, where you need to render clouds made from thousands of particles so that you can allow the player to fly through the clouds.<br><br>I use such a technique for rendering my shadow maps.  I determine if the shadow map has accumulated too much error, and if so I re-render it.  This creates a huge savings on framerate when renderign shadows from static meshes, but until recently I could not really apply these savings to animated meshes because there was no way to determine which frame of an animation the mesh was on. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In my FusionBall game none of my 16 players were being culled, and they were all separate entities. That is, I loaded one player mesh and used CopyEntity to make the 16 different players.<br><br>The difference between this and creating 100 cubes with the CreateCube() command, is that my players are all treated as one surface even if they are separate entities, able to be moved, rotated and resized as they like. Therefore I wrote my own culling routine which got my game running much faster. If I had 16 separate entities with separate surfaces, now that would be REALLY slow, and not worth Blitz's native culling.<br><br>The conclusion: Write your own culling routine, and use CopyEntity when you have more than 1 monster of the same type!

But speed optimation depends on the kind of game. For this Starwars Clones Warriors Scene it might be a good idea to use sprites, although some of them might look a bit like cardboard soldiers. If you want to use alpha Textures you will not only have to reset the alpa bytes of the texture, you will also have to rebuild the complete mesh each frame and add all Quads depending on their Z-Order or distance to the camera. Otherwise you'll come up with the well known z-order problems of alphaed objects.<br><br>Adding all Meshes to one mesh that will use only one surface is good idea. But some things must be done to make it work properly. Use only "Mesh"-Commands on the Quads until they are all added together (eg. no "SclaeEntity" or "PositionEntity" etc., use their Mesh-Equivalents). Use PaintMesh instead of EntityTexture etc. For PaintMesh you need a Brush: use the same Brush for all of the Quads. After adding all Meshes together they will all use the same Brush and therefore they will use only one surface. A thing that saves up to 40 Percent of Rendering time, seen in several Demos (Particles aso.)<br><br>Resetting the Alphabyte of the texture isn't that hard, at least it should be faster than rendering 100 thousand tris.<br>I would do <i>something like</i> this:<br><br>(the render is already copied to this texture, but alpha information was lost)<br><pre class=code>

You then SHOW the approprate one depending on distance from camera. Far off figures can be replaced by sprites or even textured blocks, it's too far to see any detail anyway. <br></div><br><br>Yes - this the way to do it. Terrains CAN be automatically LODded because they are derived from HEIGHTMAPS, so it's relatively easy/fast to calculate new mesh... other meshes are different story altogether. Reducing polys from say, character mesh, is VERY difficult to do automatically, and reducing polygons also affects lighting and mapping (because they are vertex based) and of course animations... so it almost impossible to do on-the-fly. And hard even if do it "by hand". <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
