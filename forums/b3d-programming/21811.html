I haven't played with Maya much, and I'm out of date with Lightwave. I've never even used SoftImage.<br><br>I'm currently using 3DS Max R4.2 for most of my 3D work. I find the latest upgrade prices for Max R5 and Character Studio to be pretty oppressive (i.e. a substantial fraction of the cost of buying rival packages outright) so I'm interested in hearing your thoughts...<br><br>It seems to me that Lightwave, Maya, and Cinema4D are the obvious alternatives to Max. They all have (a) good scripting languages, (b) good polygon-level editors, (c) character animation tools (subdivision meshes and bone support).<br><br>I'm leaning towards buying Maya rather than upgrading to Max R5 (since I'll still have Max R4.2 anyway...). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

For me the big reason is animation.  Modeling tools are all pretty much the same no matter what package you use but I find the animation tools in Maya much faster to use than 3D Studio Max or Lightwave (like you, I've never used SoftImage.)  In particular tools like Paint Weights make it really easy to rig characters in Maya, the hypergraph makes selecting stuff trivial (until I used it I never really thought about how much of a chore selecting stuff is in most tools,) and tools like the graph editor and dope sheet make it really easy to tweak animation by moving keys around and adjust interpolation.  Note that you can download a free trial of Maya (PLE, the Personal Learning Edition) from aliaswavefront.com<br><br>The lack of a b3d exporter is concerning but then 3D Studio Max doesn't have one either and the current conversion paths (eg. export to DirectX, convert to b3d using Ultimate Unwrap) works just as well with Maya. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The differences between academic and commercial versions of Maya and Max are crippling -- and frankly it would be dishonest for me to use non-commercial licenses.<br><br>Is anyone using Cinema 4D? It seems like a contender...<br><br>Has anyone actually made the switch from Max to Maya? (I know Joe is contemplating it.) I find Maya pretty counter-intuitive, but I've seen folks rig stuff up in Maya to be FAR more user friendly than you can ever make things in Max (e.g. I used to work with the guy who set up the virtual version of Rigel for Farscape in Maya 1.0; he essentially built up a totally user-friendly interface for a virtual puppet -- like Poser only more specific).<br><br>P.S. I actually have a copy of Hash.

While I don't own Maya yet, I'ld been using Maya exclusively for a couple years at previous jobs.  I've been using Max again for the last few months for compatibility with a client studio but for other projects I intend to switch over to Maya because I liked it so much after having used it.  Finding Maya counter-intuitive is a pretty subjective thing (but then most of the things people have been bringing up are pretty subjective;) I don't like how primitives are always created at the world origin but other than that using Maya is incredibly fluid.<br><br>For fluidity of modeling tools I prefer Wings3D (modeling in that app feels like playing a piano) but in animation tools Maya is wonderful.  You brought up rigging which I didn't even think about.  You can certainly do "complex to setup and simple to use" rigs like you described but, getting back to efficiency working in Maya, what I normally do is setup a simple skeletal rig where I have to select bones directly in order to manipulate them.  Then I hide bones in the viewport and use the hypergraph (which I keep open on the side) to select them.  This feels as you describe, like a virtual puppet, since the bones are now completely hidden and it looks like I am simply manipulating the model directly.  Oh, and to set keys just hit S.  So the animation workflow is select a bone in the hypergraph, move/rotate it, hit S, move to a different frame and repeat.  I can't compare to Lightwave in this regard since I've never used its animation tools, only modeling and texturing, but compared to 3D Studio Max the animation workflow is light years better.  Rigging is so much faster than using Physique or the Skin modifier, the rigged character is much more intuitive to work with, and setting keys is done purposely as opposed to automatically (and thus hard to control) in a special "animation" editing mode.<br><br>I also love customizing the UI in Maya.  I realize you can do this in other apps as well but Maya has a couple important leg-ups in this area.  First off the default hotkeys are really useful.  QWERT controls your basic tools (translate, rotate, scale, etc.)  Using these keys allows you to simply rest your left hand in normal typing position and quickly access those important tools.  Second, holding down the spacebar brings up the hotbox (a floating panel of all the menu items like File, Edit, etc.)  Between those and the fact that you switch between editing modes with a right-click menu, and change views that way, you can turn off the entire UI, including the top menu strip, and work like that.<br><br>**************<br><br>I'm not sure why I'm talking Maya up so much.  Ultimately I don't really care what you get; it's not like Alias|Wavefront is paying me.  I guess I'm just excited because of some recent discoveries.  For example I just learned that you can duplicate a previous position (essential for looping animation) by using the right mouse button when scrubbing the time slider.  Normally, when using the left mouse button, scrubbing the time slider scrubs the animation too.  But with the right mouse button the model stays in the same position as when you started scrubbing the time slider, so you can simply scrub to where you want and then hit S. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
