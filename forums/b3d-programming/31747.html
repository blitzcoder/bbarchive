The distortion and reduction of detail is minimal.<br>2. This method is easier.<br>3. You are wrong that you need to use two textures to map two halves of a sphere.  Any mapping you can do with two textures, can be done with one.  Two textures would make two surfaces and surfaces are expensive and should be minimized as much as possible.<br>4. The only mapping other than spherical mapping which you could be indicating that he use, would be planar mapping.  Planar mapping a sphere would cause those areas near the equator to be stretched, and the corners of the texture would be unused, wasting texture resolution.  You couldn't be suggesting cylyndrical mapping, because that would be possible without splitting the sphere in half. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

We'll say it's split from top left to bottom right.<br><br>Now, imaigne how that quad is mapped to the sphere.  The top os squished very small compared to the bottom.<br><br>That being the case, the triangle on the right side of the quad, the one with the wide part near the top, will become very thin, and everything in that area will be squished... So each "quad" at the top of your sphere is really one regular triangle, and one very squished triangle.<br><br><br>Now take a look at this image:<br><br><img src="http://www.caffeineoverdose.net/images/Sphere_before_cutting.jpg"><br><br>See how the top comes to a single point?  That is the important difference between the first and the second pic.<br><br>But you don't need to create a nother line of quads to fix that.  The problem is that all the triangles at the top of the sphere in your mapping share a single vertex.  If they each had one vertex of their own, which would be less expensive than creating additional quads, then you could make those triangles at the top look like half a quad each, and they would not have a tiny almost infinitely thin triangle squished between them potentially creeating rendering artifacts, and just adding extra polygons.<br><br>All this is a moot point though, because I can't think of any good reason to use a hemisphere rather than half a skybox.  A skybox has fewer polygons, no problems with seams at all, and allows you to use more textures so your sky is higher res.  The additional surfaces required is so miniscule that it's not worth being concerned with. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I checked the UV mapping and adjusted it and I could not fix the problem.<br><br>I understand that you reduced the size of the triangles at the top to almost a point.  But I'm not talking about those.  If I deleted those triangles, there would still be an area near the top of the sphere that isn't mapped properly even when I have tesselated it a lot more.<br><br>I guess I'll see if I can take a look at your model and see if it looks different in max. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
