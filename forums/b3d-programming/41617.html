One of the things that appealed to me is that there was already an established code base and ways of incorporating things like Tokamak. Now that BlitzMax is out should I even bother to spend any serious time on learning and creating  for Blitz3D? I bought Blitz3D last month because I wanted to start a serious project but I am not sure that I want to risk my efforts on something that will not convert th BlitzMax or will not be supported very soon. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Instead you will have to use OpenGL until you either purcase a 3rd party engine or mark's 3d module which as far as I know he hasn't started on yet.<br><br>Also, B3D is a good, gentle introduction to 3D graphics.  As far as the serious project thing goes, depends on the project as Blitz3D can do the same thing any Dx7 C program can do.  The question is the amount of work you wish to put into it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The support for the format is vast now:<br><br>Shadow engines, particles engines, terrain engines, GUI designers galore, the B3d format, Gile[s] for lighting, CShop and Maplet for levels and lighting, Pace Maker and Character Shop for animations, Milkshape and UU3d have exporters as do Lightwave, and Max (B3d Pipeline), Tattoo is the brilliant poormans' Deep Paint 3D, ODE and Tokamak physics engines, support for Ogg sound files, OpenGL engines BasicGL and VividGL, lensflare libraries, tree makers, TerraEd...<br><br>What more do you want or actually need? The list just keep on going...<br><br>Look at the fabulous results people are getting in the gallery, check out my website for some screenies of my work (you may be pleasantly surprised) - check out this link.<br><br><a href="http://www.smartscreenuk.com/SmartScreen_SmartScape_2004.htm" target="_blank">http://www.smartscreenuk.com/SmartScreen_SmartScape_2004.htm</a><br><br>The result you will get is based on how much effort you are prepared to put in.<br><br>Okay, you can't do many of the latest effects in just B3d, good games are only enhanced by effects, they don't make the game itself 'better' in game play terms, only in eye candy terms (which does of course help).<br><br>Having said that, you should seriously check out BasicGL - wow that is a FANTASTIC addition to our artillery - no question about it, toon shading, shaders, shadows, proper mirrors, bump and normal mapping, water planes, particles all built in - all accessible from within Blitz3d.<br><br>Conclusion:<br>I have been using Blitz in its various forms for many, many years. I have also been able to benefit financially from it, and I hope to continue to do so for a long time yet.<br><br>Blitz3d is awesome when used right.  BlitzMax is gonna BLOW AWAY ALL competition - I just know it will - but until a proper 3d engine is launched and tested I will be using BMax for 2d stuff only.<br><br>That is the world as I see it anyways!<br><br>Best regards,<br><br>IPete2. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I've been with B3D for a while, and even with BlitzMax coming, in their release state the two programs are for different purposes. Once 3D is fully supported in BM then yes, it will definitely be something to look at, but initial 3D support is still months away and it'll be far longer before we have a set of tools which make it more practical to use from a BASIC point of view.<br><br>I've just recently started a year long project in B3D even though BlitzMax is coming. Why? Because it'll be finished before BlitzMax can do the same stuff. :) Sure, I may convert it to BlitzMax afterwards purely for cross-platform compatiability, but for the nature of the game - there's simply no advantage in using BlitzMax.<br><br>Now that all that's said - BUY BLITZMAX! SUPPORT BLITZ RESEARCH! Even if you can't create the most fantastic 3D games right away, you'll get a headstart in the language which is going to last us many years to come. :)<br><br>+BlackD <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Bmax for the pc or the 3d module for it won't be out for a little while.  B3d does have an established code base and alot of people can help you.  It's still by far the best "game development based language" out there, so you could probably still use blitz3d for a couple more years (or more) depending on what you're doing.  If the money doesn't matter to you much when it becomes available go ahead and by bmax and later the module, and learn them well and make projects in them.  It doesn't matter, as long as you finish something :-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
