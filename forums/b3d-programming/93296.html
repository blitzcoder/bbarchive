It seems you are referring to Shadow Mapping or perspective rendered shadows.<br><br>There are many diffrent variations, I'd suggest to search for this in wikipedia for an overview of the official terms and names. On pages like www.devmaster.net you will find more information.<br><br>In Blitz you can do stencil shadows (volumetric) and Shadow Mapping. Both is slow because when you use native Blitz commands, it will not make use of the hardware power. Note: the hardware can do hardware-accelerated stencil buffers, they make volumetric shadows fast. Devils Childs Shadows System makes use of it, with an external DLL (see toolbox). There is also the AShadow Lib that is using Stencil shadows as well, but other than DCs engine, it can do multiple lights, at least as far as I know. There may be more samples, using a little DirectX7 wrapper DLL, use the search tools here and at google.<br><br>There are several samples for Shadow mapping in Blitz, including: Sswifts Shadow Lib, FastExt, the sample Yasha posted in the other Shadow thread lately ("how are shadows done today"). Yashas sample may be useful to start with because it is very short and compact.<br><br>Making the shadows with the CPU, as in these 2 methods, becomes more and more obsolete because it's slow and modern graphics cards offer many features to do most of the shadows within the pixel shaders. <br><br>Programming of shadows (that are good enough for practical use) is however one of the harder things in my opinion.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The result is very short, and to make it use multiple lights and mutliple surfaces you even don't need to understand the 3D math it does to set the UVs, you need however good knowlegde of Blitz3D, making it hard when you are not very experienced with the language.<br><br>But even then: shadows cannot be much more simple (unless you want them only on a flat ground, and not on walls).

Many people wouldn't even consider testing a game engine if it doesn't offer shadows, and a list of other things. Doing good shadows in DX7 is not impossible. While we cannot add shaders, we may at least do whatever we can for shadows and physics.<br><br>There is a number of DX7 games that are using perspective Shadow mapping (maybe some of them are DX8, but they still use software perspective mapping), to name just a few: Hitman 2, Deus Ex 2, NOLF 2 and so on. It isn't so much DX7 that makes perspective mapped shadows slow, but the way they are implemented. As long as there ain't 100 skinned, animated NPCs onscreen (they would kill the rate anyway), it is possible to use these shadows in Blitz3D, maybe it's even mandatory if you want more people to test it. Simply add some settings. Shadow detail: blob, low, mid. hi. <br><br>We are not talking about 3D Snake or Pacman here, but about some fullfledged FPS or TPS games, although DX7ish, noless with a realistic approach. I don't know about you, but I don't use BLitz3D for smartphone games, at least not as long as they haven't got the 3d hardware that is normally used with Blitz3D.<br><br>As long as it doesn't take you years, that's no waste of time IMHO. A system like fastext can be added with relative ease. It maybe needs some tweaking (eg. to stop casting shadows behind the light, or between light and caster), other than that is's running out of the box, especially for outdoor scenarios. Not sure how open for modding FastExt actually is (is the shadow sys part of the Blitz code, or is it in the DLL?). Sswifts System is open, and so are a few others.<br><br>EDIT: as an instant solution we maybe should stop asking people for "DirectX7 Support", but tell them instead it needs DirectX9c. Then when they see some shadows on the floor they may think it's something really new. :)<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
