I've said in the (not too distant) past that the little things can really make a big difference in the overall feel of a "polished" product. Today, I hope to give (and even show) you an example of one man's opinion on polishing one very small aspect of a game.

The problem: Retrieve coarse information from the mouse and convert that to smooth reactions within the game.

The solution: Filter the mouse input in such a way as to provide smooth feedback, yet at the same time tracking the user's input as accurately as possible (i.e. with no noticable lag.)

In almost every case, filtering means averaging. However, if we simply average the mouse movement over time, we'll introduce lag. How, then, do we filter without introducing any side-effects? Well, we'll still use averaging, but we'll do it with some intelligence. And at the same time, we'll give the user fine-control over the filtering so they can adjust it themselves.

We'll use a non-linear filter of averaged mouse input over time, where the older values have less influence over the filtered result.

How it works

Every frame, whether you move the mouse or not, we put the current mouse movement into a history buffer and remove the oldest history value. So our history always contains X samples, where X is the "history buffer size", representing the most recent sampled mouse movements over time.

If we used a history buffer size of 10, and a standard average of the entire buffer, the filter would introduce a lot of lag. Fast mouse movements would lag behind 1/6th of a second on a 60FPS machine. In a fast action game, this would be very smooth, but virtually unusable. In the same scenario, a history buffer size of 2 would give us very little lag, but very poor filtering (rough and jerky player reactions.)

The non-linear filter is intended to combat this mutually-exclusive scanario. The idea is very simple. Rather than just blindly average all values in the history buffer equally, we average them with a weight. We start with a weight of 1.0. So the first value in the history buffer (the current frame's mouse input) has full weight. We then multiply this weight by a "weight modifier" (say... 0.2) and move on to the next value in the history buffer. The further back in time (through our history buffer) we go, the values have less and less weight (influence) on the final result.

To elaborate, with a weight modifier of 0.5, the current frame's sample would have 100% weight, the previous sample would have 50% weight, the next oldest sample would have 25% weight, the next would have 12.5% weight and so on. If you graph this, it looks like a curve. So the idea behind the weight modifier is to control how sharply the curve drops as the samples in the history get older.

Reducing the lag means decreasing the weight modifier. Reducing the weight modifier to 0 will provide the user with raw, unfiltered feedback. Increasing it to 1.0 will cause the result to be a simple average of all values in the history buffer.

We'll offer the user two variables for fine control: the history buffer size and the weight modifier. I tend to use a history buffer size of 10, and just play with the weight modifier until I'm happy.

There's only one way to really get the feel of something, and that is to actually feel it. So I've put together a [albiet crude] demo for you to download. It's available here (~800k, requires DX8).

In order to really test our filter, I've implemented mouse input not through DirectX, but rather by simply keeping the mouse in the center of the window and detecting how far it moves from the center, then putting it back. This form of input will give us the lowest resolution. Even still, many people find that the filter performs admirably. Hopefully you will, too.

The controls for the demo are simple. Use the left button to move forward. Hold the right-button to turn off gravity, so you can fly. Use the CTRL key to slow down, and SHIFT key to speed up. If you press "T", you'll see a walkthrough that I've recorded to show off some of the collision detection. Pressing R will overwrite the recording with your own. So if you want to give me feedback about the demo (a bug, for example) the best way is to record it.

The keys to control the filter variables are f/F to decrease/increase the history buffer size and c/C to decrease/increase the weight modifier. You'll find both of these values displayed in the lower-left of the screen, just above your video mode info.

And a final note about the demo. It is crude and has been stripped down to simply render the raw geometry every frame. So it is recommended that you run this on a system with a 3D card at least as powerful as a GeForce1 card.

Does this method pose any benefit to mouse movement in a game where you see the mouse cursor, though? I would think one would want the cursor to be very responsive in such a case. Or do you mean for a 3D camera view?

Also wouldn't it make more sense to have something like 1 - (timestep*some_value) as the damping level?

Hmmm so with this method it wouldn't be too hard to modify the weights so that you can reduce the lag to the point where you are predicting the next mouse movement right? Probably by some negative weights? 

This seems like it would introduce less lag than my catch-up method which turns the user by 95% towards the actual raw new direction. Such that it gives logarithmic deceleration when you stop turning. 

I plan to try your way out sometime, thanks.

   A batch of replies... 
--- James, 

Yes, this could be directly applied to mosue movement when the mouse is visible. It would still be very responsive. Mouse movement is amplified when the entire field of view rotates based very small mouse adjustments. So when your mouse activity is not being amplified in such a way, the mouse would simply appear smoother (like going from a PC to a Mac, for example -- I've always liked the super-smooth appearance of a Mac's mouse. =) 

As for the damping level you mentioned.. no. :) If the mouse is being moved at a constant rate, but the frame rate is not constant, then the history buffer will contain larger and smaller "deltas" of mouse movement. This is a built-in timestep. I like it when you get stuff for free. :) 

--- Khrob, 

Yes, the scene is a smallish Q3 deathmatch level (~10K polygons) that a friend snagged of the web from the mod community. The lightmaps came with the data. I didn't have to do anything but manage the rendering of them. 

--- iMalc, 

Mouse prediction. Very interesting idea... However, going with a negative weight wouldn't quite do it, but it wouldn't take much, I think.

Hi there, 

Regarding mouse prediction, I think one good way to do it would be to use a Kalman filter. You can search for related links using Copernic, one link I have found is Kalman filter. I think that would be really usefull for someone who wanted to do prediction, not just the mouse position. However, I am not sure what good it would do to predict the mouse position. Anyway, I am not an expert on Kalman filtering, I have more experience with image filtering (median smoothing, noise removal, corner and edge detection, etc). 

By the way, in your article, you mention that you use a non-linear filter, that is not quite true (at least if I understood correctly). You say that you have an history buffer containing the previous samples of the signal. Then, you use a weighted sum of these samples to get the new sample. The equation for this is: 

x'(t) = a(0)*x(t) + a(1)*x(t-1) + a(2)*x(t-2) + ... + a(n)*x(t-n) 

where x'(t) is the resulting sample at time t (current time) and x(t-k), with k=0 to n, are the n previous samples. The sum of the weighting factors a(k) must be equal to 1. But, regardless of the values of the weight factors a(k), this equation is linear, therefore, the filter is linear. Unless you make some non-linear operations or clamping on the resulting value and keeping the resulting value in the history buffer (that would change the equation a bit!). 

Also, this kind of filtering introduces lag inevitably (unless all the weight factors are 0 and a(0)=1), which would result in no filtering at all. However, I think the small lag it introduces is acceptable since it really gives a good sense of smoothing of the camera motions. I use the same filtering scheme for the camera motions in my game engine.

I don't know why, but mouse filters allways made me sick. I can't play an fps with mouse filtering during more than 5 minutes. 
I don't know if i'm the only one that feels that, but if you want to have a really "polished" product i recommend you having an option to disable it. 
I recognize that the smoothness is great and looks good, but it just makes me sick.

Actually, you can get pretty much the same effect just by doing a feedback filter, without any buffers and with less computation. For example: 



float FilterValue(float val, float &amp;memory, float sharpness)

{

  return memory = val * sharpness + memory * (1.F - sharpness);

}







Just call it repeatedly with various input values and always with the same variable as "memory". The sharpness determines the degree of filtering, where 0 completely filters out the input, and 1 does no filtering at all. 

I seem to recall from college that this is called an IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) filter. As opposed to the more typical FIR (Finite Impulse Response). 

Also, I'd say that you can make more intelligent and interesting filters than this, for example filters that remove wrong responses from the mouse because it's being moved too fast. You'd want such a filter to be applied before this one, of course.

Hmmmm...OK - I've got a nice, smoothed out mouse now. But it's rather slow - obviously, progressively multiplying values by a number less than 1 is going to drop the reported mouse motion. 

Of course, I could add in a simple multiplying factor to the filtered mouse location, but it would be nice to automatically adjust the mouse speed so that it's the same no matter what the user does to the filtering coefficient. 

Can anyone come up with an expression relating this multiplying factor to the filter coefficient &amp; the buffer size? I used to be good at maths...I think my brain's melting. 

Cheers 
Catfish






Howdy folks, 

Catfish mentioned that he was experiencing a slow mouse. That shouldn't happen (Catfish - you listening? :) -- it should only smooth the mouse, and possibly introduce noticable lag with higher weight modifiers, but not slow down the mouse. 

So, here's an example of how such a filter might work, all the way from grabbing the cursor position from Windows to generating the final value. For all intents and purposes, this is the code from the demo. I munged and modified it so it would make sense out of context from the actual program. 



	// Our cursor pos



	POINT	point;

	GetCursorPos(&amp;point);



	// Our window rect



	CRect	r;

	GetWindowRect(r);



	// The center of our window



	float	cx = r.left + r.Width() / 2;

	float	cy = r.top + r.Height() / 2;



	// How much has the mouse moved since our last poll?



	float	deltaMouseX = point.x - cx;

	float	deltaMouseY = point.y - cy;



	// Reposition the mouse to the center of our window



	if (deltaMouseX || deltaMouseY) SetCursorPos((int) cx, (int) cy);



	// Shift the buffer around. If you want performance from this, be sure

	// to use a circular buffer than these slow memmove()s.



	memmove(historyBufferX+1, historyBufferX, sizeof(historyBufferX) - sizeof(float));

	memmove(historyBufferY+1, historyBufferY, sizeof(historyBufferY) - sizeof(float));



	// Put the current values at the front of the history buffer



	*historyBufferX = deltaMouseX;

	*historyBufferY = deltaMouseY;



	// Filter the mouse



	float	curAverageX = 0;

	float	curAverageY = 0;

	float	averageTot = 0;

	float	currentWeight = 1.0f;

	for (unsigned int i = 0; i &lt; historyBufferLength; ++i)

	{

		curAverageX += historyBufferX[i] * currentWeight;

		curAverageY += historyBufferY[i] * currentWeight;



		// Note! Our total is also weighted



		averageTot += 1.0f * currentWeight;



		// The weight for the next entry in the history buffer



		currentWeight *= weightModifier;

	}



	// Calculate the final weighted value



	deltaMouseX = curAverageX / averageTot;

	deltaMouseY = curAverageY / averageTot;



	// Affect our camera rotation based on the mouse



	cameraRotationYaxis += deltaMouseX * rotationSpeed;

	cameraRotationXaxis += deltaMouseY * rotationSpeed;



	// Clamp X rotation (look up/down) to 90-degrees in each dir



	const	float	pi2 = (float) 3.141592654 / (float) 2;

	if (cameraRotationXaxis &lt; -pi2) cameraRotationXaxis = -pi2;

	if (cameraRotationXaxis &gt;  pi2) cameraRotationXaxis =  pi2;</textarea> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
