Also HUD sprites &amp; objects need to be pretty darned close. I need a decent camera range, because whoever heard of poor visibility in space? admittedly, there's H-Alpha regions and dark matter, but when a gargantuan space station appears from out of nowhere when the distant stars were still totally visible, this becomes annoying.<br><br>Thenthere's physics. Newton forces my hand to write Thrust/mass gives acceleration. Because I am using delta-time functions to maintain multiplayer consistency, I can stick with seconds. Although what is a unit has no real meaning, Blitz units are arbitrary, but the hard bit is trying to maintain a 'safe' kind of ratio.<br><br>1:5000 perhaps?<br><br>All I know is that the z-buffer is gonna be working like a wh*re's clit*ris!

Quite often you arrive long before your missiles do when travelling at top speed ! Its not a problem because everybody has to slow down in order to combat and its quite acceptable because that's what would happen if you were flying at those speeds. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I doubt Il need any higher bit-depth than 16 really anyhow so that's great!<br><br>Smiff - Of course, some craft will be able to outrun some missiles, that's all part of the gampeplay and tactics of combat. Bullets on the other hand should (according to physics) have an initial speed which is added to the velocity of the firing craft ensuring they always move faster. And yeah, combat will involve slower speeds than just cruising, especially as I foresee most advantageous combat involves 'pinwheeling' opponents in order to keep them in your sights.<br><br>Shifty - Yeah, Frontier was bloomin' awkward because of the realistic physics. Elite was much better!<br><br>I am trying to mimic the <a href="http://www.themis-group.com/jg/faq.phtml#3" target="_blank">D.A.N.C.E.R</a> engine (sorry not much information available on this anywhere for the spaceflight which was very playable. The main issues here vs realism are that objects had a maximum speed in space (I give the 'reason' for this as being micro-debris in space being a threat to hull stability at higher speeds!) It resembles the original Elite flight engine with more emphasis on mass-related drag.<br><br>This means that small, light craft can turn faster and without losing too much speed, where heavy freighters would take a long time to slow down, accelerate or turn.<br><br>Andy - That makes for good reading, but the dual-pass stuff sounds a little techy at the mo. I'l try and knock out a few tests of this sorta thing until I can get the hang of it! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
