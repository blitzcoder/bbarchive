; Falling Tiles
; -------------
;
; (c) Richard Lawrence &lt;richard@...;
; Version 1.1 (5th Jan 2001).
; Thanks to Mikkel Loekke for the "GetImage" function.
;
; This simple function takes whatever is on the backbuffer, breaks it
; up into a number of tiles and then proceeds to make them fall off
; the screen.
;
; Instructions: Run the program, hit any key (bar ESC) to make the
; picture explode. After its exploded, hit any key to quit.
;
; NOTE: If you're not running Blitz v1.35 then you'll need to convert
; the jpg file to bmp and modify the LoadBuffer command in the code!
;
; Licence: Feel free to use this in your own code. Some credit would be
; nice but its not essential.
;
; ----------------------------------------------------------------------


; These are the number of sqaures across and down the image should be
; broken up into. The higher the slower it is but the better it looks.
; Using 80 for ACROSS and 60 for DOWN is very nice but jitters slightly.
; Don't try 640 and 480 - it locked my laptop up!

Const ACROSS = 20  ; Its best if this value is divisible by 640
Const DOWN = 15    ; Its best if this value is divisible by 480

; Create a type square. This contains the location of the tile, its
; velocity and the image it will be showing.

Type square
	Field x,y        ; location
	Field xvel,yvel  ; velocity of movement
	Field image      ; tile image
End Type
Dim grid.square(ACROSS, DOWN)

; Set graphics mode and load image into the frontbuffer
Graphics 640,480
; NOTE! If you're not running v1.35 of Blitz then you'll need to
; covert the picture into a bmp file and edit this line!

			; move upwards before going down again

	; Set the buffer to the back one	
	SetBuffer BackBuffer()

	; Loop through drawing each tile. If its off the screen, don't
	; draw it but increase the vanished counter. When the counter
	; hits ACROSS x DOWN then all tiles have gone off the screen.

		vanished = 0
		
		For i = 0 To ACROSS-1
			For j = 0 To DOWN-1
				; Check tile is on the screen
				If grid(i,j)\y &lt; 640 Then
					; Increase the y's velocity by one. This simulates
					; gravity meaning that the tile will speed up
					; going downwards
					grid(i,j)\yvel = grid(i,j)\yvel + 1
					; Update the x and y co-ordinates by adding the
					; velocity values. Note xvel is not changed, the

First I copied a square of the background onto a new image, the same size as the shard tile, and painted the shard over the top, with the inside colour set to mask (transparent) so the outside colour was painted on, and the inside retained the image from the screen. Then I changed the mask colour to the outside colour, so the outside became transparent. So I ended up with an image which was an arbitrarily shaped chunk of the screen. The space behind it, on the screen, I repeated the same trick on, but in reverse, thus leaving a hole of the same shape. Repeat until the whole screen is covered. Make the shards overlap and you'll get all kinds of different shapes from just a few (I used 4) shard shapes, that all fit together perfectly.<br><br>It looked really cool, but due to what perhaps was a memory fragmentation problem, I eventually cut it from the game. Don't worry, mine was an extreme case, involving LOTS of loading and unloading graphics over an extended period of time without ever flushing out the vidRAM - you probably won't have that problem! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
