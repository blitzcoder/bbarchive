This is so weird though... there are so many either ors with this.  if one half of them are shown on screen I get 76fps.  If not its 38fps.  Also I have a blur filter function, collisions detection, and some other graphic effects that one would think would be REALLY processor/video card intensive.  However these numbers are consistant whether my graphics overload crap is running or not.  So im just rather baffled.  There isnt a whole lot going on right now with this... and its either perfect frame rate or sluggish.. no either or... Vwait waiting on vsync always produces the 38fps.  I checked for extra render or flip commands no other writes to buffers.  I suppose I could just write a frame limiter to skip frames, but that still doesnt explain why its either 76 or 38 no exceptions.  I was just looking for some advice on coding the levels.  Id like to be able to modify each block written to the level with my script engine(which so far is working wonders)  Switching to a static one huge mesh with lots of polys isnt what I was wanting to do.

So lets say you make a castle out of these objects.  with 2 kinda of groups "castle_tower" and "castle_main".  I can call a script that causes the tower's to rotate and fall over, and the main castle to explode outwards all called from my explode castle script file during game play.  To me it seems logical, but I dont think its quite the fastest thing out there... I have a dual 3.4 and an ati 9600 pro and can choke it with some not-so-elaborate level designs.<br><br>Here is a screen shot of my current editor and example of what im talking about.<br><br><img src="http://vertigo.cromdesign.nl/images/editorshot.jpg"><br><br>Keep in mind this isnt locked to a standard grid... while im using really simple one sized planes now... you can scale them and do practically anything with it... like a modeler etc.<br><br>spilocke sure you can join the in the development.  Any source youve done in the past thats relative and you think could apply and you could implement thats great.  As far as stuff im not doing that that could be added are AI routines and and animation system.  Im still not sure if I should make the characters out of meshes or sprites.  Im working on the world builder/level editor now, its my main concern, and in my opinion the longest part of the engine.  This event-&gt;trigger run script system should allow the end user to modify and change any aspect of the game(I hope).  Basically I was playing zelda 3 for snes at work and it dawned on me that such and amazing game hasnt been made since then, and since all this 3d stuff no one has made anything like it... they just go with the "whatever looks new and super graphics"  totally forgetting the gameplay that made games like zelda the shit back in the day haha.... so I decided to make a freeware action/rpg engine and possible add multiplayer abilities, and allow the players to design their own worlds,  characters and interactions... Part of the reason for using sprites for characters... most people have MS paint and notepad... in theory all you should need to make a game with this engine... although if I get a decent animation system you can just use "simple" model parts and build your own characters... I donno.. sorry guys I rant too much.  But I am curious what anyone/everyone thinks of this.<br><br>Wings:<br>Yeah I like that...

Besides my engine will be heavily scripted.  One of my biggest concerns is keeping them all organzed.

Basically I'll have quite a few of the same features that the siege editor would have.  Triggers, events, entities, items, waypoints targets etc.  Ive basically given up with the frame rate.. I'll just allow for frame skipping when it starts to choke, and ive tried it on a variety of systems and its not as bad as I had originally thought with all of these single object "map parts".  Im ditching lighting.. I cant use light maps as the level will not and can not be a single mesh(id lose all of the attributes) and a few other things, but for the most part it should be alright.  Hell I have fun just jumping around in my test level for minutes on end lmao.  Trying to incorperate "cartoony" physics is a tad difficult but its working out ok.
