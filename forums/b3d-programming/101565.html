Losing 130 FPS out of 131 FPS is a rather different matter from losing 130 FPS out of 2600 FPS. You should expect to lose thousands of FPS as you start to add the very small things to your program and then the loss will taper off regardless of what you're actually adding, because there's less and less to lose proportionally.<br><br>Miliseconds are a much better way of keeping track of what's going on because they scale in direct proportion to the work being done (they literally are the amount of time being taken to do the work). To maintain a steady framerate of 60FPS or better, your main loop needs to complete its work in under 16ms; shrink that number to make room for other things (and give the system some breathing room).<br><br>I think you'll find an If or Select structure with only a few hundred elements doesn't take a measurable number of milliseconds to navigate either way (and if it does, the issue is with the functions you're calling as part of the condition checks).<br><br>You can sometimes slightly improve the efficiency of GUI stuff by batching all of your GUI checks in a single place in your loop, building a record of "all the things that happened", and then query this custom list of events yourself by simply testing the variables in it rather than spreading GUI poll commands out throughout your logic.<br><br>Also the GUI itself may have a measurable effect on your program (e.g. it's very nice to look at but a program using the BCF GUI just plain isn't going to run at above 30FPS or so because the GUI itself is slow). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

'<br><br>If it is since item 1 might have X or item 2 might have X or item 3 might have X then what you need to do is keep track of the existence of X.  When a player picks item 1 or 2 or 3 mark down that X is now in the player's inventory, then you just need to make a single check using 1 if statment.<br><br><br>This is similar to what Rroff is saying. Another way to say it is to do the checking as little as possible and keep track of as much as possible since this keeps down the amount of checking that needs done at any one point. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
