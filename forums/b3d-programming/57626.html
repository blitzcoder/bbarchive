I thought that, if something was part of a surface, it was rendered? Now, if you copyentity something, it becomes part of the surface. Well, not really, because it's vertices are the same as the copies. BUT, you can apply different textures to every single different copy.<br><br>Now, taking this into account, that means each copy must have it's own brush surely?<br><br>Now, i was under the impression, every texture basically equalled a surface.

This means that CopyEntity will still increase the surface count (although I could be wrong). The main advantage of CopyEntity is better loading speed, and far less memory usage. If you want to minimize surfaces, the only way (as far as I know) is to manually set up the surfaces (or use AddMesh to combine meshes and surfaces into a single mesh)<br><br><i>Edit: After further investigation, it appears that using CopyEntity rather than CopyMesh not only loads faster, but renders faster as well.</i> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I would hope this means that all copied entities are rendered in sequence, thus reducing the need for a state change, since they will all be using the same surfaces brushes, initially.<br><br>However, I guess if you then assign a different texture to a copied entity, it is then given it's own brush, and so no longer references the original entity's brush, but still references it's mesh.<br><br>Not sure how blitz handles things when this happens, as if all copied entities are simply rendered in sequence, there will be a state change required when rendering the one assigned a new texture, and then another state change to revert back to render the remaining copied entities.<br><br>Hmm, dunno really - just thinking out loud. :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So I'll bite: What it proves is that you can build a nice single surface sprite/particle system (copies can be scaled, oriented and retextured individually, remember) without having to fiddle and faff around with vertices manually... that might not mean much to you, but I bet it means quite a bit to those who went and wrote complex fiddly SS systems on the opposite assumption! <br><br><div class="quote"> <br>I tried a performance test to see whether CopyEntity meshes or CopyMesh meshes are faster<br> <br></div><br>Sorry, I thought the fact that it is faster was implicit in my previous post.
