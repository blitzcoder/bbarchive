I had an app where a model had all its vertices controlled by child pivots (bones in LightWave terminology).

Once the parent object was moving along with its children, the disappearing bug went away.<br><br>This suggests strongly to me that Blitz does its own occlusion based on the origin and bounding box of an object. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It will be made public if it turns out to be at least good enough to use as I am counting on it to be faster than any of my previous attempts. I hope it turns out good because I really want to see something like this to be free for blitz community use.<br><br>The only main problem I see with using a "portal only" engine is that it's best to place portals manually in which that doesn't really bother me. I just have to build a "portal editor" for it( And there are differents ways to go about that). It should even work with Quil3D's portal stuff, hopefully, as long as it uses standard like portals(defined as 2d convex/concave shaped mesh in 3D space). Also, It should even work with Maplet if it evers gets the portal update that Mark talked about a while back.<br><br>Obviously, every portal engine is different but one thing that usually remains constant between them is the standard defined portal that a portal engine acts upon( ie: as in how it uses that manually placed portal). My current engine design takes the route of if the current room's portal is in view then render it's room ( cell or sections, whatever you want to call it ) on the other side of it. The next step it takes is if any portals in that other room is in the camera's viewing frustum and can be seen through the portal in your current room then the engine will render it's room. Ofcoarse, this is done in a recursive fashion. Actaully, one could simply skip the second step all togethor to make the engine very simple and crazly fast at the cost of level design limitations.<br><br>It follows the same principles of the first portal engine that I made in Blitz3D as seen in my link below and also with what I was doing for the Community OpenSource: Project Plasma FPS. The difference is that this time I won't be using any sort of LinePick algorithm. I just need to get my test level done( using gameSpace :P ) so I can hurry up and finish my engine. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Genres that specifically benefit from VisionFX are Role-playing games, Action-adventure games, First-person combat games, Massively multi-player online games and Urban / city-based games. RenderWare VisionFX works by identifying the visible objects in a world as quickly as possible. <br><br>RenderWare VisionFX is available as a plugin or standalone product for PC, Xbox and Nintendo GameCube.<br><br>RenderWare VisionFX Features &amp; Benefits<br><br>Faster Rendering Times<br>Once RenderWare VisionFX has done its work, you continue by only drawing the visible objects. This can lead into immense savings in rendering time of up to 400%.<br><br>Faster Development Cycle <br>Development cycles become more efficient as RenderWare VisionFX calculates visibility in reducing the time required for static visibility calculation, using PVS for example. The artists creative restrictions are reduced and export processes can also become simpler and faster. <br><br>Increased Scene Richness <br>RenderWare VisionFX enables more characters and objects, with greater richness in scenes. It removes visibility-based creativity constraints so that you can make your world truly alive with interaction (e.g. deformable environments). New levels of realism can therefore be realistically achieved and larger worlds are handled with much less effort.<br><br>Increased Freedom in MMO Game Worlds <br>As RenderWare VisionFX is a real-time visibility solution, developers concerns over initial world size are greatly reduced. Developers can also allow players to introduce their own scenery (for example players’ homes and businesses) into the persistent world. And because RenderWare VisionFX reduces the pre-processing required for level design, expansion packs can be introduced easier and with a greater focus on the content.<br><br>Cutting Edge and Feature Rich Technology <br>RenderWare VisionFX effectively blends a number of cutting edge visibility technologies including hierarchical view culling frustum, occlusion culling, portal culling and contribution culling. RenderWare VisionFX also supports on-demand loading of scene data using the object visibility information, enabling the application to effectively stream in visibility optimized content. Other techniques such as LODs, multi-resolution geometry and image-based rendering can be used with RenderWare VisionFX for further enhancing performance and content scalability.<br><br>About RenderWare VisionFX Technology<br>RenderWare VisionFX is the first efficient general-purpose visibility optimizer that requires no scene pre-processing and works with massive dynamic environments of any topological structure. The visibility queries are output-sensitive, so the amount of time RenderWare VisionFX spends in finding the solution is dependent on the number of visible objects rather than the number of objects in the scene. RenderWare VisionFX calculates visibility in reducing the time required for static visibility calculation.<br>RenderWare VisionFX is powered by Umbra™ from Hybrid Graphics - The leaders in advanced solutions for real-time computer graphics.<br><br><br>Powered by Hybrid Graphics’ Umbra™ technology, VisionFX is available for PC, Xbox™ and NINTENDO GAMECUBE™, as a plugin for RenderWare Graphics or as a standalone library.<br><br><br> <br></div> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Imagine two cubes next to each other where the sides that the two cubes touch share the same vertices. Instead of having polygon sides there, use that vertice data for portal data. You can imagine those sides as a portal where it's now invisible. Say we are standing in one cube and the side that is now a portal is in our camera's viewing frustum. So with preconfigured portal data, the engine would take the portal data from that portal we see in view and display the cube that is next to the cube we are standing in.<br><br>Edit: didn't see above post. But, what you said above with your grid stuff can be done with a "trigger box". You can select all rooms that can be seen from one room manually or find some complex pre-calculation to do it for you. Then have a "box" or something in the doorways of each cube ( or room ) and set states to AlphaEntity 0 or 1 other rooms when you walk/run through them. But that wouldn't be precise as portals are.

Gfx card really don't like frequent state changes.<br>That's why blitz doesn't handle a lot of surfaces very well, and is also the reason why in Quake 3 (or is it Doom3?) the BSPs are not used any more for rendering, but only for collisions purpose.<br><br>I *think* for todays cards the best is to use some lazy occlusion system with octrees or something similar. BSPs are just not very well suited for high poly count levels (they generate a lot of additional faces due to splitting, and in addition the PVS size increases very fast with the poly count increase).<br>Any thougts on this? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You can store all the vis data in a list ( adjacency list ). Each element of the list could be a seperate entity ( room for eg. ) that stores adjacency info ( that is other entities that are visible from this one ). Then, in game, look at what entity the player is in and refer to the adjacency list to render the other potential visible rooms. Blitz will cull entities out of camera shot for you.

I'd also make a copy of the original object before I started removing triangles and add some velocity to camera rotates &amp; movement so I could predict whether an object was going to be coming back into full view and use the original copy. Also, depending on how complex the scene was - I'd probably think about storing copies of the occluded mesh at various stages so that they could be re-used without re-occulsion if that makes sense.<br><br>eg. just off the top of my head:<br><br>Complex mesh in middle of screen<br>do<br>    cursor left adds velocity to camera rotation<br>    predict worst case scenario (ie. if you took your finger off the key now, what is the x,y,z,rx,ry,rz of the camera - project a box from the camera out to the viewdistance (this is used for a boolean)<br><br>    trace ray from center camera to four corners of object (or more)<br>    if none are visible then hide object<br> <br>   on next removal call (ie. every N millisecs)<br>    remove triangles based on worst case scenario<br>    via a boolean subtraction of the object - inverse of the box<br>    (the inverse box is like a big cube with a hole in the middle that the camera looks through, everything outside of the hole is subtracted at a triangle level)<br> <br>loop<br><br>I would use a similar method to cull objects partially obscured by other objects - by doing an extrude from the backfaces of an object in a direction paralell to the cameras vector, extrude object to viewdistance, subtract it from any objects it intersects.<br><br>We all know about how to do this stuff with trees etc, however I'd be interested to code the boolean subtraction stuff and see how it performs... again it would need to be in a .DLL for speed I think, but a prototype in B3d would be the way to go initially.<br><br>Just some ideas; I don't really have a need for this sort of thing at the moment; however I will in the next 6 months - if I crack the code I'll share...<br><br>-R<br><br>p.s. be forgiving - i'm just banging this out quickly to seed some ideas - and i'm exhausted ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I have seen many occlusion demos (including, I think, some from the system  renderware uses) where the demos were faster with occlusion turned off! I imagine that when they were written they were pretty quick, but hardware T&amp;L has changed the situation quite a bit. Hardware likes to be given a decent chunk of polys at once, which tends to conflict with...<br><br>(2) Occlusion must be done accurately or not at all - close enough is not good enough. As soon as you get a bit too 'generous' with an occlusion algorithm, the effect ripples and you get an exponential slowdown.<br><br>(3) There is no one solution. Most modern occlusion algorithms work based on the assumption the geometry is 'highly occluded indoor scenery', but take things outdoors and such algorithms die. Doesn't matter to Carmack as he obviously doesn't go outdoors much, but for a generic game creation package it sucks a bit. Its probably a necessary evil though...<br><br>(4) Portals are tricky. The idea is neat - create a temporary 'frustum volume' using the viewpoint and a portal poly and clip further portals to it recursively - but the complexity is exponential. For example, if an average sector has just 3 portals, then each time you traverse another sector you are cubing the amount of work required.It doesn't take many sectors for this to blow up. It then becomes tempting to increase the size of sectors, but again, you start running into problems with (2) above!<br><br>(5) Should we even be bothering? While I was writing Maplet, I was unable to come up with a level that slowed down my hunble GeForce2. Hardware is hugely faster now and will continue to improve.

First I worked with a House Model that included tons of Child Meshes. I used a precalculated Visibility List for each Cluster (about some "Meters") to hide or show the Children.

It is an Adaption by Shadowturtle, Author of the Scream3D Editor. I have no idea how fast it is, but I found it pretty clever:<br><br>First all Object must be in a List. Every Loop they are colored using a unique color. It's possible to use right the List index as a Color, but this works only in 32 Bit Mode. Probably it works in 16Bit too when $F-Steps are used.<br>All Objects EntityFX are set to fullbright and Color instead of Texure Rendering. <br><br>Now the Cameraviewport is set to something very tiny, maybe 160*120 or even less.<br><br>A Renderworld is performed. Now all Objects in the List will be compared with the Pixels of the Rendered Picture. If their Color is visible, they will be shown, if not then they will be hidden.<br><br>After hiding everything neccessary the cameraviewport is set to original Size, EntityFX is reset to Texturing and Lightning and whatever.<br><br>Now it continues as usual, a fullsize Renderworld, Flip etc.<br><br>As I said, I don't know how efficient this Method is, but I think for Levels with lots of seperate Objects, combined with a relative reasonably short CameraRange it could boost the Speed quiet a bit.<br><br>EDIT: Tested - too slow. Precalculation seems to be the only way - combined with halos Idea to split up a Mesh in Surfaces.<br><br><br>But with all those "Render only what's visible" Solutions you have to UpdateWorld _before_ the Occlusion, because when you hide things behind the camera before the UpdateWorld and then walk back, you'll fall through the ground. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Wouldn't it be far quicker to use a surface/mesh comprising of just 2 triangles for a wall."<br><br>I don't know what CSHOP does with the cubes you create in it, but if it's not culling the hidden surfaces then NO THANKS. :-)<br><br>Btw, cubes only have 12 tris, not 32.  6 sides x 2.<br><br>Yes, ideally one would create a level which only has those tris that would actually be visible to the player.  And all professional games that I know of construct levels in this manner.<br><br>In Angry Tanks, my own game, I have a level construction tool which allows you to place down 3d "tiles".  Each tile is a 3D model, and all similar tiles are added to the same surface.  Then you can push a button in the level editor to optimize the level, and it goes through and finds all triangles which have three vertices touching and deletes said triangles from the final mesh.<br><br>I posted this optimiztion function to the code archives a while back.<br><br>The trick though is that the function will only work if the triangles overlap.  That means you have to specifically create the 3D models so that when they abut up against one another, the triangles match up.  The cubes Blitz creates with the CreateCube comman on the other hand, (and probably the cylynders as well) do not have the triangles set up properly to do this.  If you place two cubes end to end, and then look through from one side to the other, you'll see the diagonals cross instead of aligning.  Ie, the front side diagonal goes top left to bottom right, and the back side goes top right to bottom left.<br><br>Solving this issue for just cubes with just two polygons per side would slow the algorithm down quite a bit, but solving for the general case...  Well...  I suppose if you created an algorithm which finds all coplanar tris and then makes a set of "faces" and then only compares one face to another then maybe you could handle less strictly constructed geometry, but you're still gonna have cases where you could say, place two cubes in a T contiguration over a third cube's front side and have a case where the third cube's front side is completely contained and should be deleted but is not detected.  Such cases are hard to detect.<br><br>Optimization is already slow enough, taking about a second to complete for a small level which is just fast enough to use for doing it when the game is actually running when the level loads or possibly even when geometry changes if it's optimized more.  But coming up with somethign that can handle any case would only be useful for precalculaton and saving the optimized level out, and that's not what I wanted for my game. :-)  And it would be hard to accomplish.  I don't recall ever seeing a tutorial on how to do that.  <br><br>I basically just wanted a realtime optimization I could do when a level loads, which would remove the faces between cubes and floor tiles because those were creating tons of cracking artifacts.  In my case, the number of polygons was so low that the speed of extra polygons in the level was not really an issue. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

These probably shouldn't be used to calculate occlusion!<br><br>Mark, you were right about no maps being complex enough to slow Blitz down, sort of.  The polycount for the map I posted, without detail meshes, is 1900.  That's without caulking (removal of any face that has a "caulk" texture).  In my experience, caulking reduces a map's brush polycount by about 75%.  So let's estimate the caulked map above to be about 500 polys.  How big is a map going to get?  A map ten times that size would be a meager 5000 polys to render, for the whole map.  This is not even worth occluding.  Just merge the whole thing into a single mesh and draw it.  If a couple of Stroggs walk by, it's going to cost more polygons than that!<br><br>The static meshes, however, will kill performance.  A map ten times the size of the one above would have a 350,000 static mesh polycount.  So now we can come to a general rule:  Brushes occlude static meshes.  And that's it.  Brushes never get hidden, and static meshes never occlude anything.  Let's just use the bounding boxes of the static meshes to test occlusion.  If anything, doing that will err on the side of caution, and never result in any visible mistakes.  Suddenly our job just got really easy.  We have a bunch of boxes to hide, and a bunch of flat walls to hide them with.<br><br>Mark, you saw my CSG occlusion demo last Spring, where I calculated occlusion by performing CSG on the outlines of objects, relative to the camera.  If the same thing were done, using brush walls as the occluding object, and just using a bounding box to test occlusion of a static mesh, large levels with insane detail would work.<br><br>I'll have a large UT2003-detail map running in a week.  The map might be kind of repetitive, but will show the technique. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

What can be done, though, is to create a very 'loose' occlusion algorithm that occludes huge chunks and sacrifices quality for speed (but it *always* renders when in doubt), which won't use much CPU time but will help a hell of a lot on the GPU (though the GPU will still be under significantly more strain than it would be with a Quake 1,2 &amp; 3 style occlusion system) in huge indoor worlds, and I think that's the way forward.<br><br>It's easy to say that, but coding it (especially when setting it up in an automated fashion) is another thing! :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This becomes a surface.A long corridor for example would become one mesh.<br>For accuracy, a further check could be to use a threashold for max amount of non-visible pairs before it's disqualified and is apart of the next surface created.But it's still added to the current mesh, because it can be seen from some points, but also the next mesh, so this is the overlap, so we can safely changes visible meshes.<br><br>Now when we create the next mesh, we link it the previous, and link the previous to the next, do this by generating a bounding box.<br><br><br>Then, you have a bunch of meshes totally independent of scale/size, and again totally oblivious to the shape of the 3d world.<br><br>Save these meshes, out, along with list of links, and the bounding boxes.(The meshes are linked to the bounding boxes too)<br>Then in game, we just check what bounding boxes we're in, remembering they can overlap safely, and turn the alpha up on those meshes, turn it off those we arn't in.<br><br>ultra fast, just ultra expensive to compile the meshes..but i'm sure it can be improved further. <br><br>The biggest drawback of this is down to way you handle surfaces now.

You have to define a resolution for the grid of points you'll use to check for visibility. The more points it has, the longer the VIS calculation and the longer the ingame hiding/showing. Depending on this Resolution there is a certain kind of ILLEGAL GEOMETRY, which could be visible from one footstep byside the checked point, but remains invisible from the point. So you cannot simply use any beloved Map or Model. An object must be bigger than the distance between two points, watched FROM ALL SIDES.<br><br>Checking a level with say 50*50*50 Positions can easily take up to several hours using Linepicks. So slow is slow. ALthough it is a precalculation, it's uselessy painful.<br><br>Some time ago I have released an other method that is indeed much faster. It is using a "Identify Color by Uniqueness" Method (ICU). Basicly every Surface is using plain Color and no texture. Every Surface will have it's own, unique Color.<br><br>Now a camera is positioned at every point, take 6 Renders like in cubic enviroment mapping. Now use readpixelfast to check for the colors on the rendered images. It's even possible to use the color right as the index of a blitzarray that acts as flags for visibility. For 16 Bit color Resolution the values might have to be shifted some way to work correctly, but in 24 or 32 Bit it's really simple.<br><br>A working example can be found here:<br><a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/codearcs/codearcs.php?code=341" target="_blank">http://www.blitzbasic.com/codearcs/codearcs.php?code=341</a><br>(note: use it to see the ICU method in action, other parts might be spaghetti to useless)<br><br>There is a further problem: if the initial Map has let's say 20 surfaces, you will need to fragment the Map Mesh into clusters to be able to hide the occluded parts. Therefore each cluster will contain its own copies of the surfaces it uses. This means you will now have about ten times more surfaces in the videoram, depending on the leveldesign. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
