Not sure what you mean by confused ??<br>As for 'simple interfaces' - well that's purely down to the skill of the programmer !<br>BlitzUI is a 2d GUI - the interface is drawn in 2d using 2d commands over 3d whereas F-UI is a pure 3d GUI - there are no 2d drawing commands and so is much faster.<br><br>p.s Your app doesn't need to know exactly which window its working with it just needs to know what gadget or menu option has been triggered via the events. It would also be fairly easy to keep track of what windows are open by having a boolean variable that is set to true when a window is opened and then set to false when it is closed but I can't think of many scenarios where this would be necessary.<br>The important thing your app needs to know is what Gadget has been clicked rather than the window itself.<br><br>p.p.s.<br>I see you repackaged the same question with a different title ! I wouldn't have answered your previous post due to its demanding and patronising "Oh so nobody knows !" comments. I think that you probably understand now that that type of post generally gets NO response at all and only serves to annoy people who would have probably helped if you'd had a bit of patience.

I already am aware of that! The way I got<br>my editor set up, There are no gadgets on the window to test<br>for!! I created a camera view on the window and I needed to<br>have some sort of way of determining which window was active<br>by the user clicking on that certain wondow.. There are<br>other world editor's out the where you must click on the<br>window to be able to edit objects in that window according<br>to it's XY or Z axis.. My editor is set up the same way!<br>And also to your second comment about a boolean varible and<br>such... I ended up creating a function to serve the need!<br>Works quite well too!<br><br><div class="quote"> I see you repackaged the same question with a different title !

The post was up for a<br>    good while and still I didn't see any comments what so<br>    ever! Normally!! Somebody at least gives one reply<br>    within a short amount of time, And I have kinda' gotten<br>    used to that you might say! I didn't mean to come off<br>    rude or demanding &amp; patronising as you so put it!!<br>    I was hoping that I might of gotten an answer to<br>    hopfully help me in this situation I was in!<br><br>C.)

Try<br>    dealing with the people I deal with on a regular basis<br>    and you would be amazed of how much patience I really<br>    do have! I got more patience than what other people<br>    give me credit for!<br><br><div class="quote"> This is not a help desk but a forum <br></div><br><br>Hmmmm.... That's real funny there smiffy ol' boy! I could<br>of sworning that forums are generally there to help people<br>since most companies that sell's a worthwhile product like<br>Blitz3D and such... often advertises them as a means of<br>helping promote their products!!! You'll find alot of<br>products out there on the market today that will often<br>state what I just said to that effect! If forums in this<br>matter speaking are for nothing more than just jaw-jacking<br>all day... Then what good are forums anyways in this matter<br>here? Why have I been told a long time ago by mark sibly<br>himself, That if I need any help and all... Go to the FORUMS!!!!! I rest my case!!<br><br><div class="quote"> you cannot demand an answer. <br></div><br><br>I don't! You just took it that way! And what's wrong with<br>you anyways Smiff??? You are one of the good ones that normally always helps a guy out! Why are you lashing out at<br>me in this way? Id' never have expected this from you?!? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
