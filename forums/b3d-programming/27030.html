I also tried to set the mask flag and have the main texture (not the deatil one) with black masked areas as to allow the the deatil to show through, but with no effect :-( Any ideas/suggestions would be greatly apprecaited, as its driving me crazy!<br><br>Thanks! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Fade out the detail texture when you enter a certain area, before reappearing with a new one<br><br>2..

Also, would verticie colour work on terrains? I tried it ages ago (perfect for what I want) but ended up writing a more complex way of painting pixels depending on the height of the terrin beneath them. That would be very cool if you could explain how I could colour the vertexes on terrain, thanks again!<br><br>:-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

(which I think is what your doing)<br><br>Good points.. you can treat it as a mesh, and paint surfaces/vertexes however ya like.<br><br>Bad points.. slower than blitz terrains, more surfaces than you can shake a stick at !.<br><br>So.. now I'm back with blitz terrains, suffering with the same problems as you. No way of adding different surfaces or playing with the vertexcolor command :(<br><br>(also stuck with a square patches !!)<br><br>But I did find this lil program: <a href="http://www.delphigl.de/projects/terrtexgen.html" target="_blank">http://www.delphigl.de/projects/terrtexgen.html</a><br><br>Great program.. a real gem !.<br><br>So now I'm looking at how well I can put 2 blitz terrain meshes side-by-side without any gaps.<br><br>The next experiement is to have 2 layers of detailed textures that I can fade in and out as you cross over into a new patch. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Unfortunately the fading in and out of detail isnt really suited to what I need (islands with smooth undetailed blues of water flowing into sand and then deatiled grass). Heres a pic of what I have managed to do so far, and Im *really* happy with the result (still got to work on the blue of the deep water, the sky as well) considering this shows about 1/1000 total map size and each map eventually will be created at random with hundreds of individual, random islands -- except, no ambient lighting! (which is crucial for the project). Give us a yell if you want me to send you a zip file of the source code and files :-), and feel free to adapt it/use it and hopefully fix these damn ambient lighting woes!<br><br>[img]http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid87/p2ae6d3c7e5278c2f8a1e3bef6b61d1a5/faa39bd3.jpg.orig.jpg[/img] <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So its not actually on the ground.. but on a seperate object just above it !.<br><br>I've got an idea about combining robs ideas for realtime shadows with it... have a sort of small object underneath you that moves around with you - following the contour of the landscape.<br><br>If you was to put all the detailed tile textures onto one big texture - you could then scroll to the new one when needed.. this should not only work - but also allow the whole terrain to get away with just one layer of texturing. :) should be a hell of a speed up !!. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
