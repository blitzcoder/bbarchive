An easy way would be to choose a random target position and make the bot go here and when it has reached this position, suddenly change direction so that it is a bit unpredictable...<br><br>For the render you have already some examples of trails in the code archives and in the code examples with blitz3d. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I made all the gfx a 4 color thing and they are built in.<br><br>I guess I should have mentioned that it is 2d not 3d. Sorry about that. Why 2d in Blitz3d? I was just curious to see if i could. I made it work for Multi-Play on 1 computer. And that works too. I played using 2 sets of controls for about 3 hours last weekend finding bugs.  I even added collectables.<br><br>I used an array for the map to keep track of all the walls. And yes it is in an arena type thing. The point is to last longer than everyone else. There are menus, player setups, game setups etc...
