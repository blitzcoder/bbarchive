It must have hundreds, maybe thousands, of ways of handling a situation. That's just one agent alone, when you add more, aware of everyone and thing around them, I imagine it could be processor hectic.<br><br>Just curious is anyone has messed with this idea yet. I want to try to develop one intelligent agent that is aware of obstacles (without the use of actual nodes) in realtime, then give it a purpose (search for blue cube?) then try to get it to react to another agent with the same sets up basic thinking patterns. If anyone knows of any good online tutorials aimed at AI, I'd appreciate it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Also, I keep my game logic at around 120 updates per second so even if you're cycling through a few baddies they don't stand around thinking for ages. Of course you can update more than one per cycle and do more than one stage of logic per cycle.<br><br>Anyway... That's me. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I appreciate it. I just want one "free thinking" agent, motivated by something to begin with. Then I'd like to expand the system to handle two agents. Make them aware of each other. Try to get the to interact in some way. Then expand rapidly from there. I can imagine it's gonna take me some time to flesh out what all I want to be able to do. I imagine if it ever became expanse enough, it would make an excellent AI library to sell for blitz. Thanks everyone! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I figured out that each agent will need part to be made of, that can be randomly mixed and matched, and each agent will have a "catalyst" attatched to certain joints. The catalyst will be their way of interacting. If the agent goes up to a another and swings his sword (the catalyst) a simple collision detection will determine whether he's been struck, and how to react. As well, there will be a sense of observation, as one agent will know when to block the other (not always succesfully, and in a variation of pre-animated ways)<br><br>It sounds so fun, can't wait to get my psuedo-code pages done (on page 3 now) Thanks everyone. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The interface is almost identical to a game package called Mind Rover.  It also throws in some fuzzy logic stuff just to make the system generate more random AI.  It's really not much more then large scale game AI.  I think your basic RTS has more complex AI then massive.  That's a guess though from what I saw.
