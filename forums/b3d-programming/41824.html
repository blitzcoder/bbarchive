Here's what would happen with each protocol in the case of lag.<br><br>UDP: If a packet arrives late, it is discarded and the client waits for the next one. To Player A, player B will appear to stop suddenly and will be further down the hall in an instant. This is "warping" and doesn't slow down the game when a packet is missed.<br><br>TCP: If a packet arrives late, the server is informed it's late and resends it. Obviously, this is a bit slower in low-bandwidth conditions, but player A will see player B stop suddenly and continue to run down the hall without teleporting. This can slow down gameplay, but it's a more reliable protocol than UDP.<br><br>Basically, if you need information sent to player's computers as quickly as possible, go with UDP. If you need players to receive most, if not all, of the information sent, go with TCP. The reason both protocols are around is because one provides speed at the expense of reliability and the other provodes reliability at the expense of speed.

BP Pro offers several messaging options.. including Reliable sends, and Ordered Reliable sends.. matching and even surpassing the functionality that TCP offers in such matters. This is why UDP is generally shunned, because you have to code your own protocol on top to deal with reliability; BlitzPlay has already done this.<br><br>Oh and yes Blizzard originally used TCP for their Warcraft games, however in WC3 they finally realized the benefits of UDP and switched over their networking code to UDP in a patch soon after the game was released.<br><br><div class="quote"> I thought TCP in blitz paused the game sometimes whilst it recieved packets? I heard skcn[ac] talking about that a while ago... <br></div><br>This is indeed a possible problem, although it can be reduced as long as you code carefully. One problem I ran into when I first tested TCP years ago was that I would use commands like 'readline' to attempt to read from the TCP stream. The problem of course being that if the full line had not been yet received, then blitz would delay while waiting on the data to be received. You can sort of get around it by using ReadAvail to find out if the entire message has been received, and then process it from there. There are other delays inherant in TCP which will not be so easily avoided, however.. and this is where UDP shines. TCP is perfect for what it's intended as, but real-time applications (games, data streaming for voice, etc) wasn't really the goal in it's design.<br><br>A quote from <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/features/19990903/lincroft_05.htm" target="_blank">this</a> article (written by the developers of X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter): "Lesson two: TCP is evil. Don’t use TCP for a game. You would rather spend the rest of your life watching Titanic over and over in a theater full of 13 year old girls."<br><br>I'm not saying you have to use UDP, and you have to use BlitzPlay, I'm just offering the pro's and cons of the available options. Namely TCP = not intended for realtime apps (turn based games should be ok), and UDP = sucky because you have to write your own message reliability code, but is overall much better for games. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Let's say it didn't though.  After xxx amount of time passes, the server resends the packet.  Well now the receiver gets the packet and sends a confirmation packet but now THAT packet gets lost.  Ok now the server is sending the packet for the 3rd time. /sigh  It could be a horrendous snowballing effect.  Chances of that actually happening are pretty slim but anything is possible.  End result would be a VERY late packet.  Hey but at least the chat got there right?<br><br>My recommendation is TCP for RTS type games and UDP for FPS type games.  Thats the easiest solution IMO.  TCP is pretty easy to learn also.  Just have to use what's best for the job.  There are some excellent TCP/UDP examples in the archives. =) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
