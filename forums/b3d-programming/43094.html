Then it'll be a basic platform game and then probably the frogger clone I've done - none of it rocket science, but karma wise should earn me at least $24,000,000.00.

However, this really isnt necessary with a good search feature.<br><br>I toss code around like candy, regardless. Sometimes, its the only way I feel I can illustrate my point. All of my projects have been free and opened to the public in one form or another. Some complete, some not. <br><br>IMHO, it isnt prudent to attempt to sell code, apps or games in a Game/App Development community for many reasons: 1) Most here are 'Programmers' that have the potential to dev what ever you're attempting to sell, 2) Narrow Market Base,  3) I appreciate the concept of open source. <br><br>I will pay for quality Animated/Non-Animated Media and Artwork which have a higher value in this sort of community in my opinion.

Dont give up Rob! <br><br>I should be discouraged as well, with all the negative feedback I recieved on  Project PLASMA FPS. I provided a sh!t-load of support and code for it. Regardless of my efforts, I'm accused of not finishing the project or in other words causing the project to fail. There has yet to be a successful FPS Community Project so I dont feel that bad about it. <br><br>All I know is that I tried really, really hard to make it work. I'm taking what I've learned from that project and using it in others. I'm not leaving empty handed.  I realized that I can improve with each effort and that goes for anything I do.<br><br>I would expect that lack of code contributions, could stem from Blitz3D coders running to BMAX. IMHO, the move is totally fad for most. A large majority of these programmers around here are simply not ready for a OOPL. Heck, most dont apply basic 'object-based' programming techinques to their BASIC programs. The hype will be short lived and they'll be back.<br><br>Anyhow, I'm going to continue to contribute my ideas, theories, code, art, or plain BS.
