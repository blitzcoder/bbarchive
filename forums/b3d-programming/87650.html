Waypoint A 'sees' waypoint B. B 'sees' C.<br>So A can't see C directly, but can reach B to reach C.<br><br>How can I translate this in code ? How can make it procedurally, without using a path finding A* algo, which requires usually a big matrix ?<br><br>I want the characters in the game, follow a path to go from waypoint A to waypoint H for instance. A and H are not directly in view, but all the in-between waypoints are all in a table, from which an algo can find the appropriate path to reach the target - for ex. A-B,B-D,D-L,L-H.<br><br>How would you accomplish that ?<br><br>Suggestions and thoughts are very welcome.<br><br>Regards,<br>Sergio. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'd say allow a waypoint to have different destinations based on the normal of the opponents movement... that would allow you to have waypoints that act as patrol runs<br><br>Your still going to need to have a pathfinding system though... for in between waypoints... otherwise the opponents would look like they are hung on a laundry line <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

A* is just a graph search algorithm and as such, it doesn't care whether you have a big matrix or a handful of nodes. The choice of search algorithm usually depends on what information you're trying to get out rather than what you're trying to put in. For example, A* is generally regarded as the best search when you have a known start and end node. Dijkstra's Algorithm is usually used when you have multiple target nodes and want to find the nearest one. Breadth-first is more usually used when you need a full list of possible paths, limited only by distance from the start point. (EG: Hex wargames might use it.)<br><br>If you're looking for a specific path from a known point to a known point and you don't want A* (note that I haven't seen a good reason for you not to use A*, but I'm going to assume that there is one) then the next most common alternative would be Dijkstra's Algorithm. It uses no heuristic, which means it tends to explore more nodes than A* and as such it's generally slower than A* when searching for a path between two known nodes.<br><br>So if you really can't use A* then I'd try Dijkstra's, but I'd really need a good reason not to use A* if it were me.<br><br>EDIT: In case you really do want to use Dijkstra's algorithm, here's some information on it: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
