Mainly though, I'm always reading how they're slow. Does that mean slow to render? My main question being, if I were to create my own system with LOD and everything I need, assuming it's tightly coded, will custom meshes render quicker than blitz terrains?<br><br>My second question: I want to make a terrain system that calculates terrains given a certain amount of key points (where the terrain smoothly goes through all those height points).

In the castle demo, the terrain looks kinda smooth, yet is never made of more than 768 polygons.<br><br>But that terrain is just rolling hills.  If you want an bumps, or hills in the distance you need more polygons.<br><br>Blitz terrains start to really cost you framerate when you get up into a few thousand polygons of detail, and that's still not much detail.<br><br>If a detailed terrain is what you want, then custom meshes will get you much more detail.  But if you want good view distances you'll have to make your terrain out of tiles and have several levels of detail for each tile of terrain.<br><br>My terrain system uses that method.  Multiple static levels of detail for each tile.  I allow one texture per tile, so the texture can be rather varied too, though if you really want high texture detail you'll need to use vertex alpha and multiple surfaces so that you can tile the textures more than once per tile of terrain.  The surface count is what limits you to large tiles though, so if you did something with vertex alpha you'd want to limit yourself to no more than 4 textures per terrain tile or less, and you'd have to make the tiles 4x as wide to keep the number of surfaces the same.<br><br>"My second question: I want to make a terrain system that calculates terrains given a certain amount of key points (where the terrain smoothly goes through all those height points). I had a go at creating a function for that before and it stumped me. Before I embark on it again, is there an algorithm already documented somewhere?"<br><br>There are definitely algoithms to do that, but I don't know a specific good one that can work just with points.  A bezier surface for example would require additional control points at each point.  Four I think.  <br><br>There's something called nurbs... dunno how those work.<br><br>Tehn there's perlin noise... I have a function for that int he code archives.  It occurs to me that you could define the points for one of the lower octaves... and so define only a few points, in a grid, and then allow the perlin noise function to fill in the higher octaves of data based on that.  I forget if my function calculates things the right way round for that though.  You'd need to divide the height each time and I think I multiply it, so I work from the high octaves of noise to the low octaves.<br><br>My perlin noise function also uses a cosine interpolation function for bilinear filtering...   You might be able to use cosine interpolation to interpolate between your heigts somehow.  Imagine a single wave of a cosine curve.  The height of the start of the curve, above 0, is your first point, and the height of the end of the curve, below 0, is the height of your end point.  Assuming the second point is lower of course.  That gives you a smooth curve, but it wouldn't look very realistic.  Neither would any sort of bexier curve or spline surface really.  Not noisy enough.  That's why I use perlin noise. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I am building an entire planet that uses it to display a 120 km area at a time. <br>Of course that is only if you are standing on a cliff overlooking a large area. <br>Most of the time a viewing area of 13km or less is enough. <br>And the main playing area is about 150 meters wide with a res. of 1 meter per vert. <br>That's about the size of an average city block.<br>From there the viewing area gets less and less detailed the farther away it gets.<br><br>And I still would like an answer to this matter. <br>Has anyone tried using a snapshot idea as a backdrop for a terrain. <br>I would like to incorperate a snapshot idea into my terrain engine so I don't have to render as far a distance so often. <br>Of coarse I mean applying it to a sky box.<br><br>PS. In my experiance with Blitz3D I have found that I need to do a lot of work arounds.  <br>There is always something that Blitz just doesn't do the way I need it to.  <br>If I didn't look for work arounds I couldn't use Blitz, or any programing language for that matter. <br>They all have there short falls. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I thought of using a large box that is textured with an image of the city from the outside. <br>The box has images of gates on each of the 4 sides, <br>then when you step up to a gate, the box is replaced with the city inside of a box. <br>So when you enter the city you are looking at an image of the outside world projected on the inside of the box. <br>The image is a high wall with the sky behind it, maybe some high mountain peaks.<br>The rest of the box is filled inside with your houses and other buildings. <br>In turn your outside terrain is replaced with an inside structure. <br>Smaller buildings on the main terrain could use a simular idea but on a smaller scale. <br>And the outside images would only be seen through the windows. <br><br>My terrain engine uses a factor of 3 for each level out. <br>It has a central mesh surrounded by 8 meshes of the same size. <br>(look at the numeric key pad the 5 key surrounded by the other keys.) <br>Then this area of 9 meshes is surrounded by a ring of 8 meshes, each the size of the center 9 meshes. <br>(again looking at the numeric key pad the 5 key represents the preveous 9 meshes. <br>I continue this concept outward using rings of 8 around the center, each 3 times coarser in size. <br><br>( Actually I should rephrase  that: I start with the coarser set of 9 meshes, and then render the center mesh further <br>to get a mesh 3 times finner in detail. <br>This I do down to the point I have 1 meter between verts. <br>I could easily go another lever to get 1/3 meter res. but I stoped at 1 meter.)<br><br>That is how I get an area 120km by 120km with a framerate over 300 fps. <br>My system specs are at the bottom of my posts. <br><br>I have all my seams joining smoothly without any cracks, <br>But were I still am having difficaulties is moving this large multilayered mesh smoothly across the planet. <br>As I walk the mesh has to be set to the new height values of the next section. <br>This would be easy if the mesh used all the same distances between verts. <br>But the rings of lower and lower res. make it more difficult. <br>I render the finer res. areas using a form of fractals, that always gets the same values for a given vert. <br>So my whole planet is rendered from a small 512x512 height map. (Actually 486 by 234)<br>The planet I have designed is 9,565,938 meters around the equator. By 4,605,822 meter from North to South border. <br>I am staying away from spherical stuff though. <br>So my North and South borders are oceans that end at a wall of ice. <br>Maybe someday I will create a circulare north and south poll area but not now. <br><br>It still needs work, mostly the right math to keep it rendering fast as the mesh moves. <br>Any ideas about how best to do this? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
