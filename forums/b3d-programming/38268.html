Looks like i can get about 30,000 polys on the screen in one 1 milli..which is great because my goal was about [30-40],000 polys on the screen at once.  While i was doing my test tho, i had a cal that predicted the number of polys a sec it can do.  When ther was about 55,000 ploys on the screen...it was sayin stuff like 27,000,000 polys a sec(theoridicly).  When i had about 5 million on the screen..it was goin about 3 fps a sec which means  5 million * 3fps = 15 million per sec theoridicly.  That's a big drop<br><br>So i was thinking...is it faster to say have things render in a few pasts.  Say i have a cube.  And i have say 50 pivots.  only 1 cube tho.  Each Pivot contains Rotation and Position.. So i was thinking if i just made the cube match a pivot then render with CameraClsMOde cam, 0,1 and put it in a for-next loop for 1-50 and render each time.  Would that be overall faster than having 50 cubes on the screen.  I was thinking about maybe a forest with alot of trees..u can have 1 tree with pivots and many seemly faster small renders, compared to having 3000 trees with their own position and rotation.<br><br>Has anythign looked into this.  I know i'll have to make sure i organize render order, that's not too bad. <br><br>Now maybe tryin to have 3000 renders of one tree can cause some problems i figured, especially with render order gettin out of control maybe. <br><br>Do u have any experience with this?<br>I'll like to pretty much do anything that can get FPS high because i want to have at least 5-12 milli do everything else in the game expect render period(AI, Collision, and such)  I have alot of ideas on how to Free up process and stuff like with AI and such.<br><br>So multi render &gt; single render in some cases or what's the deal? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Once you get into the 60,000+ range, it will be much faster to collapse all your trees into one.<br><br>I use anywhere from 4 to 30+ passes in my engine, so it is an okay technique.  It's also really useful for seeing which prts of your renderin process take the most time. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Cool stuff.  I should have something up soon.  Probably a particle engine.  I've been design the Particle engine and alot of other stuff with one thing in mind...scripting...i have to make a scripting language.  I've been design it in my head and on paper for a while now.  I think i'm ready to sit down and get it going.  Like i said,it's goin to take a while. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You<br>would have to throw that into your calculations but that<br>should be easy to do per system by checking video memory.<br>a ratio based on half of the currently available video<br>memory. That way textures and other stuff will have room<br>to move if they need to. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
