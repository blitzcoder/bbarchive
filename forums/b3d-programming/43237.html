It's using an api call named SetParent (surprise :) ) Although it creates a new Window and then parents the Blitz Window to it, it may be exactly the same with a parent window that already exists. Of course you need to know the class name of that Window. I found it pretty hard to find the name of several App Classes, eg. the MSIE. "Greatis Windowse" is a great Tool for reading out such things. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The reason why I'm not ending the embedder process via the main program, which I could do easily, is because I want to have as little work in the non-blitz end as possible.<br>So far, in theory, it's all good other than that :D I have a spinning cube inside of a disabled window with a title bar (which I want) and it's practically all being done via the embedded program - the program doing the calling just gets its window handle and execfiles the embedder with its own handle as the commandline.<br>Next comes the big crash: Running through a C program :D<br><br>Does anyone know where I can find some kind of documentation for the Win32 stuff?

Don't ask why, but my compiler is a pile of ancient stoneage garbage that doesn't even support spaces in file names (let alone the clipboard or decent hotkey standards), and the header files are all 10 years old at least, and I'm too lazy to replace them.<br><br>Anyways, can somebody please write me a quick program in another programming language other than b3d, that does nothing but what the following does?:<br><pre class=code>
MyAppTile$ = "Blitz as a Child Test - Main Window"
Include "Consts_Win32.bb"

Graphics 800,600,0,2
AppTitle MyAppTile$

Global hWnd = GetActiveWindow()
;NOTE: Now covered by self-embedder
;style=GetWindowLong(hWnd ,GWL_STYLE)
;style = style Xor WS_CLIPCHILDREN 
;SetWindowLong hwnd,GWL_STYLE,style

ExecFile "SelfEmbedder.exe " + hWnd

; First parameter is the scancode to fake, the second is the window name
InstallCloseHandler(222, MyAppTile$)

exfg = 0
While (Not KeyHit(1))
	If KeyHit(222) Then exfg = 1 ;for clicking on [X]

	If exfg = 1 Then Exit
Wend

UnInstallCloseHandler()
End
</pre><br>Basically, use GetActiveWindow() to get the handle of the window, execute the exe file called "SelfEmbedder.exe" with the window handle as the command line, and go into a main loop exited in some way (or you could probably just stop the program in some way).<br>ShellExecute(), I think, is the way to execute a program via C++, just in case you need to look it up (you can tell so easily that I'm a c++ n00b).<br><br>Please email the .exe and, if you want, the source, to dillpickle79@... or DylanMcCall@... (however, gmail may give you trouble with attachments).<br>If you want to make a Java applet I will pay you. I'm not saying what with - it doesn't have to be money or a program or even any material things, but you will be payed... Maybe I'll finish something finally so that the community here gets something from my incessant questioning, because this project will be ignorable for a bit.<br>Now that I've layed out the rules - I'll actually probably pay you in that way no matter what you give me so long as it should work.<br><br><br><br>Also, the compiler giving me heck is true, but it's mostly to cover for my own present inability to code in a complex programming language.<br><br><br><br>PS: Consts_Win32.bb is here if you want them: <a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/codearcs/codearcs.php?code=589" target="_blank">http://www.blitzbasic.com/codearcs/codearcs.php?code=589</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
