That's where GNet comes in.  It lists your computer's IP address along with some game information on a web server (with a hard coded address like www.blitzbasic.com in stock GNet) so that other people can find your game.  So your game must be able to upload game information to GNet and also retrieve it to create a server list.  The FPSNet example does this.  GNet uses PHP and MySQL to store the information on a web server.  Blitz connects to GNet through the HTTP port to send and get information ... just like a web browser.<br><br>After that it's pretty simple.  You send messages between computers to update positions, chat, shots fired, score, etc, etc...  You usually have reliable and normal messages.  Reliable makes sure the message gets to the other computers but is slow.<br><br>What specifically did you want to know cause after typing that it seems simple and like I probably didn't answer your questions. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

What happens is that the message gets divided up and each part is placed in the incoming$() array.  Then the client reads the incoming$() array for the information all depending on the type of the incoming message.<br><br>So for example we'll look at the shotgun (this is from the FPSNetUpdate in the Networking section of the archives).<br><br><pre class=code>
SendNetMsg(2, "2," + Left(Str(shot), 1) + "," + Left(Str(shot2), 1) + "," + Left(Str(shot3), 1) + "-", p\iD, op\iD, 0)

</pre><br><br>Case 2 means if this is message type 2 indicated by our sent message as:<br><br><pre class=code>
SendNetMsg(2,
</pre><br><br>So if we have a message of type 2 then make some particles where we're getting shot and if we haven't just died lets take some damage.  <br><br>If incoming$(1), incoming$(2), or incoming$(3) isn't a zero then we got hit by 1 or possibly all 3 shots from the shotgun so let's take some damage.<br><br>Also, yes GNet uses Mark's server to list games and you don't need to know PHP/MySQL to use it ... unless you want to move it to your own server which I did for some things.<br><br>As for movement, the client moves his/her own player and then tells everyone else where he/she is.<br><br>It's been a while since I wrote this code but that's the general idea.  This code is a simple peer to peer example game.  If you want to start getting complex then a strong client server architecture is required.  The Torque Game Engine handles more complex things (like projectiles with ballistics) easily and I probably wouldn't recommend trying to write your own engine dealing with the complex stuff right off the bat.  Make some peer to peer games to understand why or what the other stuff is needed for. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
