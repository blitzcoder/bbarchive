That could be quite good. Just you trying to outdo the internet's signal to noise? Good luck. Somewhere in the middle as you seem to be? With random potentially untargetted ads? Who knows? If you do go that route, a paypal 'donate' button (which also removes ads) might be a good plan. I wouldn't say 'shareware' works, but if you have 'retention' incentives, and low buy-ins, you might be closer to free-to-play &amp; get that kind of crowd.

What you may not realize is if I go the ad route I have to make them as present as possible to expect any sort of return at all, one ad when you leave the game wont yeild enough impressions for any major ad agency to want to allow me to hook into their bank of ads, and thats the only real way to go because their systems are pretty good in terms of sending targetted gaming ads ect.

Support would be a little less stressfull as well without anyone putting cash down for the game, I wouldnt have to maintain a seperate demo &amp; full version release, nor would I have to worry about the demo getting cracked.<br><br> multiplayer games have higher support requirements and require a lot of players to remain active in order for the product to be of value to additional customers, im assuming this is what publishers must be thinking about it since none have had enough interest to grab it without a single player campaign.<br><br>edit: those are my pro ad reasons.. ive not determined if its the best idea yet, hence my post for advice. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
