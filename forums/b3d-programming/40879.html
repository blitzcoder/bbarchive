I started this thread in the interest of Blitz3D being improved such that it would be an actual competitor- graphics wise, and I think we know how that sells a product these days- to the likes of other engines such as 3D GameStudio, TrueVision, DarkBasic Pro, etc.  Because, obviously, people are still buying those engines- but how many people are still buying Blitz3D?  I honestly don't think that much money is being made off of it anymore, and that's partly due to Blitz Research's downright horrible marketing and lack of engine features for Blitz3D.  If you were in the position of someone who wanted to make a game using modern technology and graphics in a RAD environment, would you really choose Blitz3D?  I know I wouldn't- its technological features have been outdated since release, and this in comparison to its aforementioned competitors is not going to make it fare well.<br><br>I would personally attempt to convert Blitz3D to DirectX 9 if the source was released, as this is in my best interest because I think it's a good development environment, but its technology is plainly and obviously outdated, which is why I've begun writing my own engine in DirectX 9 and C#- using the outdated tech. that Blitz3D has will -not- sell a product these days, and I'm pretty sure Mark knows this.  Blitz Research is pushing dead technology, and I don't think there's a high chance they can do that much longer- it's like trying to produce a quality game in the original DarkBasic: not going to happen.<br><br>Bit of a rant there. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The reason was not a lack of 3D capability in blitz, but a lack of any real examples or products that could get game houses to want to use it, versus other eqaully or lower priced options.  So far its all been JAVA and C++ on the those projects. <br><br>One thing I would like to mention is that developing a 3D engine is sort of counter productive these days, IMHO.  With the number of high quality engines out there, some of witch are even FREE, rolling your own is usually just a waste of development time.   That time could be used much more productivly working on the actuall game.   Natuarally many of us like the tech details and pride of doing it ourselves, and this too is fine for a hobby, but if you plan to go commercial, get a engine and use that.<br><br>Here are 2 free 3D engines that are being used to create games as I write this:<br><br>CrystalSpace <br>Genesis3D<br><br>I have mentioned in the past that these should be looked at for use with BlitzMax, but if DLL is your bag of tea, you could probably wrap these for use in Blitz.<br><br>The biggest problem I see with roll your own engines, is that they never seem to go gold.  Its always in a eternal development loop.  You create the engine, but by the time your about halfway done, out comes DirectXnextRevision with a ton of new cool, all be it totally not required, features with just enough changes to the base set of features to make its easier to start over from scratch, in many cases.  In a way Im impressed with Mark and BRL, they stuck with DX7, no constant version chasing to add bloat and features that 90% of the users of B3D will never even use.  Its not easy to stand your ground on these things.<br><br>As for Open Source Libs, while I think it would be kind of neat, I don't see it really having any real impact for the masses of Blitz Users.  So I can't say I'd like to see mark waste time on this, just get on with BlitzMax and more TOOLS!  <br><br>PS: Im was a Linux user and supporter back in the .9x days of the kernal( when the whole OS and tool set fit on 2 3.5" floppies) and I still am, I do support open source.  But not all things need to be or even should be open source.  :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
