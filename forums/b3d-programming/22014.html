Why? Because this would not allow you to alter objects individually from within your engine. <br>Example :- You import your 'level' object and your 'door' objects and set them up within LB. If the whole scene got combined into one mesh, you wouldn't be able to open and shut the doors.<br>What LightBulb does instead is save the scene to it's own format (.LBL). This stores information about all the meshes INDIVIDUALLY. Then, using the provided 'LoadLightBulbLevel()' function you can import your levels EXACTLY as they appear in LightBulb, whilst maintaining access to each of the objects individually. This includes access to the UserFlag$() that each object can have that you can use to assign behaviours etc.<br>Check this example :<br><a href="http://www.binary-people.com/downloads/lbexamplelevel.zip" target="_blank">http://www.binary-people.com/downloads/lbexamplelevel.zip</a><br>that demostrates exactly what I'm talking about.<br><br>So to sum up that point, it's not one big .B3D that gets exported, but it's just as easy to load AND has MANY benefits.<br><br>To answer your other questions :<br>(1) I haven't looked at the DX export for a while because the call for it wasn't that great. Sorry.<br>(2) The transparent color is always 0,0,0 (Black). This is a Blitz limitation. However, you can set an entire texture to be alpha'd to any level. <br>(3) Meshes and lights always appear at the current camera position (so you usually need to move a bit to see them.<br><br>Thanks again for your kind words - much appreciated :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

LightBulb can make anything from 4x4 to 1024x1024 lightmaps depending on the lumel size YOU set. So make smaller lightmaps if you're worried about memory.<br>b) YOU could make your 'level' all one object if you wanted to. Then it would have ONE lightmap. The reason you can have multiple objects AND lightmap each object individually is so that things can be kept separate IF NECESSARY eg. you can have lightmapped pickups that are separate objects from your level. This also brings my UserFlag$ system into play, which allows you to set ANY behaviour for ANY object without having to code everything individually. This is something you CAN'T do with a single .B3D object.<br><br>Perhaps in the future you should read the manual before you start throwing accusations around, and describing thought out, pre-planned features as 'problems'.<br><br>And as for being 'unusable for games'...LOL.<br><br>Download the example 'game level' for a start :<br><a href="http://www.binary-people.com/downloads/lbexamplelevel.zip" target="_blank">http://www.binary-people.com/downloads/lbexamplelevel.zip</a><br><br>That was put together in half a day.<br><br>Then ask the people who are using LightBulb to make their games :<br><a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/bbs/posts.php?topic=21526" target="_blank">http://www.blitzbasic.com/bbs/posts.php?topic=21526</a><br><br>Then read this review by a Blitz user :<br><a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/bbs/posts.php?topic=22073" target="_blank">http://www.blitzbasic.com/bbs/posts.php?topic=22073</a><br><br>Then let me tell you that my own LightBulb-designed game is curently running at &gt;60FPS with 30,000 polys on screen on a mid-range PC.<br><br>And if that doesn't convince you then you must have an alterior motive for posting. <br><br>I have gone out of my way *sooo* many times NOT to make LightBulb and Quill into rivals.
