What you people need to do if your serious about this, is decide what the main core needs to consist of.   Heres my list.<br><br>Event system(An event queue with access functions)<br>Collision system(A system that registers collisions in the event system, etc.)<br>General Message system(Inter system communication if applicable)<br>A console(usually needed with FPS's)<br>Generic Entity class/type.(Necessary for efficient scripting)<br><br>With these and a few other possible items at the core, everyone should be able to build new code modules(That obviously must work indapendantly from all others).

Some projects are too ambitious from the start.<br><br>I think Blitz Peeps should still do advanced stuff, as long as it isn't embedded too much - in fact, there seems to be quite a few people that specialise in advanced stuff.<br><br>The only reason why I say this as I have noted in the forums that some people say they are developing a FPS and they are including this feature and that feature, before they even have a framework engine that actually works.<br><br>The above is just a thought - I think the whole idea of a new FPS open-source engine is a great idea.

For example, if I want to 'bind' switch04 to door01 (the numerical suffix bieng the ID) so, that when switch04 is triggered it opens door01 specifically. I merely store the ID into action associated with the switch.<pre class=code>switch\action\function%=switchDoorOpen
switch\action\i%[1]=switch\id%
switch\action\i%[2]=door\id%</pre>This ID system requires the use of an array of types<pre class=code>Dim switchindex.switch(255)
Dim doorindex.door(255)
;in which the ID is the index
switchindex(switch\id%)=switch</pre> The Handle is defined upon the initialization of the type and it varies often. It is true there is a great deal you could do with just a handle, however, I do not recommmend the use of the undocumented Blitz Object and Handle functions. Using IDs you know exactly what is doing what, where, when, and why.<br><br>I must also elaborate on the 'action' system and how much power it will give to the engine. The Action System is a flexible and easy-to-use Function Selection System (a function pointer). Its great for use in Triggered Event Objects, Dynamic Effects and Functions, Artificial Intelligence Systems and much more. <pre class=code>Type action

End Function</pre> Include an action in the structure of the entity and you can give the entity power.

As a first step let's copy/paste pretty much everything from the "entity control" command reference from the docs. <br></div>Holy smokes:) Its a good thing we are the csv files to manage such a large number properties. I would agree with Shambler on this one. A generic game entity is not an optimized solution. Each game entity contains a very different set of data, thus a specific type structure for each game entity is more efficient.<br><br>I use lots of types in my coding. As a matter fact, I have developed object-based coding techniques based on Blitz Types that makes it very easy for me to build objects on top of each other. I would package most common properties into small packages, for example: <pre class=code>Type vector
	Field x#
	Field y#
	Field z#
End Type</pre> There is an entire <a href="/codearcs.php?code=513" target="_blank">vector lib</a> in the code archives I recommend we use. I will write packages for common properties and create a set of entity type from those. I'll post them for approval. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The outdoor scenes I envision are similuar to what the Unreal 2003 Tournament Demo has which would be perfect for my method. Any big flat or rolling hills style terrain will get squarely sectioned and have fog limiting far view. Ofcoarse, I'm trying to get my editor done at least in a usable way to test out my method asap.<br><br>Frank, that's cool. I can wait for the info, no rush. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

My concern was about the size or radius of a node waypoint was to make sure that any given size in height ai bot would no doubt be able to interact with the waypoint node.<br><br>In the "simple bot ai (WIP)" code, instead of the hardcoded +/-3 to see if the bot is in that zone, I would like to have that soft coded via waypoint properties. In an Editor, this would allow one to simply make an adjustable zone in a level's pathway and calculate the center of that box'd zone as the global position of the waypoint node. In this way, one can visually see the zone area that the waypoint node effects for detailed optimization of waypoint placement. Just a suggestion and mabie something you haven't gotten to yet. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
