I'm sort of curious about that now...  I even wonder if you can mix animations with AI for the computer, that's what's getting me concerned.    To me, it seems like that may be the problem, if the enemy's trying to follow you around, there's obviously no way that the CPU can rotate the enemy around while he's chasing and dodging into you, that would be cool if he did (sort of like an asteroid or something like that). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I also tried code that you can be shot down and the enemy scores if you trip over your own bullets, too.  Unfortunately, this also means that once you shoot, you will shoot yourself down right away, which isn't what I was intending.  I wanted this, so that if you are chasing the enemy around, if you run into your bullets before they go off the screen, the bullet will hit you or the enemy.  If the bullet hits you, it's just like the enemy crashing into you, he will score.  That may be impossible to code the bullet to penetrate you well after you shoot it, not right when you shoot it on contact.  <br><br>Also, I believe that setting about three different difficulty tiers won't be out of the question, either.  Like, to increase the speed of the bullets and the enemy when you select a more difficult round.  <br><br>Might want to consider programming this around my joystick, make it play like an XBox or PS2-style game, all that should make this game complete once and for all, just need a title screen, a menu, and maybe more enemies to shoot at, then we got it going gold. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
