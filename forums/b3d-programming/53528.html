As a newbie you'll be learning to program as you go, finding out how to manipulate your graphics, structure your objects and functions, and create and use data collections of one sort of other. This means code evolves, but for a big project you really need a good design before you write anything. Otherwise you can get lost amongst spaghetti code (as I do, because my code has evolved over time and I've used some quick fixes to bypass problems rather than carefully considered solutions!)<br><br>A big game needs a clear design, and you can't design until you know what you can or can't code. Do you want an array or a linked list of enemies? What info is your level data going to need? How are you going to structure your object creation and manipulation functions? If you pick the wrong choices early on, you can spend a lot of time and aggro replacing them.<br><br>Just as if you were learning to write music you wouldn't set yourself a 30 minute 4 part symphony as your first work, or if you want to make an epic movie you start on smaller, cheaper films to develop your skills, it's very ill advised to jump in at the deep-end of programming. It's better to hone your skills and understanding writing smaller programs, and from these develop libraries you can use in your other projects so the work is still contributing to the final goal.<br><br>In your case, let's say you want your RPG to be isometric view. First of write a little one room isometric pacman or something where you get to understand your graphics engine's requirements, and you'll be able to build the necessary codebase that you can then use for your RPG. Then if you want a menu-driven interface, write (or add to your pacman game) a UI library (or learn one of the existing ones). Taking each aspect of your game one at a time in separate cases, you'll get a better understanding or what your final game will need. Then when you design it, with pencil and paper and diagrams and scribblings of datatypes, you'll be in a MUCH stronger position to just write the code without hitting many frustrations, and you'll be free to concentrate on ideas instead of the mechanics of programming.<br><br>Most wannabe game writers don't get anywhere, because they're full of exciting ideas but don't realise what a hard slog writing dull code can be. Working on small projects and having lots of small successes is the best encouragement you'll get. I don't think many wannabe game writers heed this advise, even though it's very common, but boring as it is to shelve your dream game and work on silly little programs of no importance, it is invaluable. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There is a lot to learn/master.<br><br>I would also say that it makes a LOT of sence and saves a lot of rewriting and time to sit down and try and fully design the game WITHOUT writing any code.  I know you wanna dive in but it may actually save you from dumping your code and starting a refresh.<br><br>I stronly recommend working on a less ambitious project to start with just to get the basics... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
