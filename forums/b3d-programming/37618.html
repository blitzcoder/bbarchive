In windows 98+, it had problems.<br><br>Anyway, my project (den bros 3), died with the introduction of windows 2000+ XP because they didnt allow for alot of the things in a dos window that 95/98 did.<br>========<br><br>The question is:<br><br>Does anyone else here like the idea of a program to wrap Qbasic code to Blitz code, effectively reviving the older projects?<br><br>I have successfully managed it with Den bros 3, and Total Sonic, and in doing so noted alot of the differences in command sets. I have also found it to be an easier task than first thought, though Den bros and total sonic only used simple qbasic commands.<br><br>the way it will work:<br><br>1) Read .bas file, and change any commands that are directly compatible with any blitz commands, and change variable types.<br>This section would take notes of any incompatible commands.<br><br>2) Read through all SUB routines, if it is a sub, rename it to function and leave at that. if it is a function, find a command that is similar to &lt;nameoffunction&gt;= and change it to "return". <br><br>3) Any incompatible commands are "Included" into the output code from a seperate BB file. (for instance, directQBs sprite commands could be written in blitz seperately and then it would get included into the output BB)<br><br>The result COULD then be:<br>&gt;Compile output .bb file<br>&gt;Run output .exe file<br><br>This could then mean the birth of a compatible version of "Qbasic for windows" (which was wanted years back and is too late now, but Qbasic is still quite active amongst win95/98 users surprisingly!)<br><br><br>I find this sort of thing very interesting, and just wondered if anyone would find it useful? and/or if anyone would be willing to help write any "wrapper" libraries (like directqb). Obviously not everything would be re-written but the main used commands will be. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

An excelent example:<br><br>An online mate of mine wrote a game... hes still working on it, which is excelent, but with new versions of windows spewing dos out the window, he may soon have no people able to use it.<br><br>the amount of work gone into said project is imense and rewriting it is not realy feasible.<br><br><br>he Runs this program, points it to the Qbasic source...<br>and walla, his game runs in windows 2000/xp and much much smoother :D <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
