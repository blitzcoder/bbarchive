I have enemies in a Type something like this:<br>Type badguy<br>Field X<br>Field Y<br>Field etc.<br>End Type<br>The problem is this: when the laser goes through more than one enemy, I need to figure out which one was hit first and stop the laser at that point.  In order to do this, I am going through the members of the Type with Each, seeing which enemies are hit, then going through again trying to figure which one is closest to the laser.  What I am wondering is how do I select a particular member of a Type?  I would like to figure which enemies are hit, mark them somehow, and then check just the members hit to see which is hit first.  Are the Type members identified somehow?  I see the commands to move back and forth, first, last, etc.  Can I somehow remember the name/number/whatever of a member and just test the ones that fit?  It seems like all you can do is look through them all each time or just one at a time.  <br><br>OK, to summarize, what I am asking is: how can you go through members of a type, set the ones that fit a certain criteria aside, and then select only certain members to test again or process or whatever.<br><br>Thanks for reading, any help appreciated! :)<br><br>Ian <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'm new to using types and sometimes they confuse me, so arrays just seem simpler to me.  It's funny how whatever you used first as a kid is what you want to go to, heheh  A type would probably be better because you can delete extra ones and have whatever size needed - an array would have to be dimensioned first.

Surely, you can do this in a single loop which means storing handles etc.. is overkill?  <br><br>It's not clear how you are identifying which alien was hit first so I'm assuming a simple distance check as an example:<br><br><pre class=code>
Hitfirst.alienT = null

for a.alienT = each alienT

   Dx# = a\x - Bullet\x

In the game you are shooting a laser that instantly shoots to the edge of the screen.  The problem comes in because what happens if you have more than one alien hit by the laser?  The laser should stop after hitting the first alien or other object.  So if I just do a check for whether the alien has been hit and go through all of the things hit, I will most likely be past the first hit alien/element of the Type and will have to somehow go back to an earlier alien/element.  <br>What I mean is this, say I shoot the laser as a line, collision check this line.  Say four aliens are hit.  I check the first alien hit, find that it was is 400 pixels away, check the second alien hit and find it is 100 pixels away, check the third alien and find it is 300 pixels away, the fourth, 200 pixels away.  I am already past the second alien in the For...Each loop.  I need to somehow perform the hit on the second alien.  <br>Basically, if the last alien hit is the closest one, one loop would work, but I won't know which one is closest until all have been checked.  Something like that, if that makes sense(?) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This is exactly what I had in mind, just couldn't figure out how to access just the one member of the Type collection.  I'm new to Types in general, mostly just used them to multiply enemies so far.  I think this will work well, and in one pass.  I know blitz is very fast in straight code outside of functions but I still want it as simple as possible because I hope to have a cloud of enemies onscreen with no slowdown at 60 frames/second.<br><br>I'm sure the object and handle stuff will come in handy sometime too, thanks for explaining that as well :)  <br><br>I'm using Sprite Candy on this prototype, so I am learning that at the same time and the collision is different.  I'm used to dealing with absolute screen coordinates and SC seems to be waggling things a bit the way I have the code right now because I'm using automatic facing and movement commands.  But that's the fun of doing something new.  If I had everything figured out ahead of time, what challenge would there be, heheh<br><br>Thanks everybody for helping with this question.
