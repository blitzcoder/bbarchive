The only problem is if you are layering multiply or add blended textures over an alpha texture, which is just as well because even before the latest update that only worked on certain hardware.<br><br>I was pretty scared when I saw that same post so I tested those features myself after updating.

Blitz can emulate more levels of multitexturing, but doing so precludes mixing multiply blending and alpha transparency.  Many people are pushing for him to provide a command to determine the multitexturing capabilities of the users card and turn the effect on/off as appropriate, but in the meantime you're best off simply not doing multiply blending on top of alpa textures. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Hm, one trick to try is using multiply blend mode for the floor instead of alpha transparency.  I'm not sure what effect that'll have, layering a multiply blended texture over a multiply blended base texture, but it's worth a shot.<br><br>Another option would be the technique from the "real mirrors" demo.  Can't find the link (sorry) but the technique was pretty simple.  You render the scene with a camera placed just below the floor facing up (the the floor is made of one-sided polygons it won't interfere with the rendering,) copy this to the texture on the floor, render the scene again from the player's view, and then flip.  This is a lot like using cube mapping for reflections, except since the reflective surface is flat and unchanging you can just use regular texture mapping instead of cube mapping. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I considered baking the lightmap on to the texture (acceptable for a dark, brooding game) but unless you use some sort of tiled system that's going to leave you with a very low-res texture stretched over the one surface that, because it's a bowling game, people are going to spend a lot of time staring at.<br><br>The only thing I can think of, off the top of my head, is to carry the lightmap on a separate version of the geometry which is overlayed on top of the non-lightmapped "proper" geometry. The lightmap geometry has a floor of its own so will lay a shdow over the alpha'd floor that you add; the "proper" geometry has no floor of its own, allowing players so see through to the reversed "reflection"; the reflection geometry is rendered with a lightmap but no floor of its own (it would be superfluous). That's THREE versions of essentially the same geometry, but if your scene is low poly enough it *might* still be preferable to rendering another scene and applying it as a texture. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
