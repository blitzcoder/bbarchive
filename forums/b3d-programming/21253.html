I havnt worried about stuff that was only there too looks good until now.<br><br>As to the more constructive comments, I've heard people say things like "Good luck getting the animation to look that good in blitz", etc.  Is this simply a lack of quality exporters/features in popular modelling packages? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The major annoyance at the moment is getting animations from Max, Lightwave, Maya, etc. (i.e. professional 3D modeling and animation tools) into B3D format. The most popular shareware tools (CharacterFX, Milkshape, and Ultimate Unwrap) are very well supported.<br><br>It's pretty easy to export animations from high end tools as MD2s (which have significant limitations) because Quake 2 was so popular. So if you want to use high-end tools you can use MD2 for now and wait for a one-click export to B3D, or you can look at some of the workarounds people (like Joe Hocking) have published for getting from Max to B3D using a shareware program as a file converter.<br><br>If you were working on a reasonably well-funded project (this seems to include *none* of us), the cost of writing a B3D export tool for our 3D weapon of choice (e.g. Maya) would be trivial.<br><br>If and when I produce a "serious" project in Blitz3D I'll write scripts to export meta-information along with my model from Max (or Maya if I decide to switch). For the moment, I'm using MD2s as a stopgap and they look fine (even the lighting issues endemic with MD2s don't seem too bad to me). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Both export directly to the B3d format.<br>There is also a BVH importer for Milkshape which allows you to import motion data from programs such as Poser. You then have to build your mesh around the imported animated skeleton without moving or rescaling it to preserve the animation . Using this method I have obtained  good results.<br><br>There are 2 Max exporters being worked upon at the moment that claim to support all animation including Biped &amp; Physique - If this happens then I'm sure we'll see a lot of good animation in Blitz - however we wont see truly 'bendy' type bone animation till it supports weighted vertex. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you set the upper thorax as an IK terminator then you can animate one arm without effecting the other etc.<br>The IK tool is really an aid to 'posing the figure' , helps to create more natural movement and can save time having to move/rotate each joint individually - you dont have to use it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
