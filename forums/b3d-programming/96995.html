Here is my idea: <br><br>The Overlay System: <br>This is an Image that has a layer of images drawn on it. Each image has a specific color (an int that is the handle of the bank.) <br>Why do this? When a full screen render is called, it will draw ONLY the pixels that are visible and won't waste time drawing pixels that are not. Not only will this system improve both individual and full rendering, but it will also allow gadgets that are custom shaped (like oval, triangle, and all other shapes you can think of!) <br>Another advantage is the ordering used. Want to bring a gadget to the top? It is just a DrawImage() away!<br><br>As far as that I am drawing a blank :(<br><br>Does anyone else have Ideas of a method to use? I am open to types, banks, and dimensions for information storage, but I do need help setting up a way for parent/child control...<br><br>And then the crazy idea of making a virtual processor that is given access to images and buffer controls... :( I am thinking too far in to it...<br><br>Anyway, you guys have any ideas? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Pixel crunching 2D is really slow even when run through a third buffer like that, unfortunately (and more importantly, it can't be combined with 3D without slowing down both systems dramatically). Whereas a 2D-in-3D system just lets the graphics card do its thing and handle this stuff automatically.<br><br>There are a few decent GUI libraries already made, so I wouldn't recommend designing a new one unless you have some radical new idea for doing it more efficiently.<br><br>My final observation is that without native support for function pointers, it is literally <i>impossible</i> to design a GUI system that's actually easy to use or efficient, so you kinda have to make do with second place in B3D. However, you can get a lot of the same effect using integer function IDs and dispatch functions - but you have to be willing to write said dispatch functions yourself (I have a very simple GUI framework based around this... it kinda works, can share it if you like). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

All gadgets are being redesigned and the number of commands are to be kept at a minimum. It is going for many programs, so I can't make any shortcuts. Also I like to write my own code for practice (I program for the learning experience, problem solving, and experimenting with new ideas, not really for profit (that is for when I turn 25 or so :)<br><br>How would I go about using 3D for such things (like alpha or so?) Do I just use Graphics3D and call 2D commands only (Could a 3D graphics speed them up?) or do I have to use a different projection mode on a camera, and then set the texture of a one-sided square face to draw a gadget (or something similar?)<br><br>Thank you for responding btw, I do appreciate it! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Types faster than arrays?? THouth the opposite was true? Anyhow, there's a certain dedicated usage for banks, arrays and types. Types are especially useful when you don't know how many data sets you'll need. At the other hand, accessing a type by a simple index, such as the chessboard index XY might be significantly slower with types, compared to arrays, at least it was when I checked it last time. Using types is also more kind of "let Blitz do the maths behind the curtain", using things like "For Each (no matter how many there are)" - something you may like or not. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you need O(1) access to a specific object by index though, there's nothing stopping you putting said objects in an appropriately-typed array.<br><br>You're right in that finding an object by For/Each is really quite an inefficient way to do it (although Object/Handle is fast enough for realtime use... don't know how that one works internally, I think it might use a map). This isn't really comparable to arrays or banks though since... no built-in list of either of those is provided at all (in fact, no mechanism for indirectly referencing them is provided at all).<br><br>(The builtin lists have <i>literally nothing</i> to do with types or objects, and are a prime example of the confusing design flaws I was talking about in the Education thread. It <i>doesn't make sense</i> to associate lists with types! This is probably why they were removed for BlitzMax.) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
