(I use photoshop and rely heavily on layers, but you essentially have the same structure in psp)<br><br>As a base i have an uv-map (ie a line map of unwrapped faces)<br><br>The next layers is just solid color shapes derived from the uv-map<br>(In your case iguess i would have a brown layer for the stock and grip and a grey layer for the metal parts)<br>Note that there is no detailing on these layers, just flat colors<br><br>Next up is any number of detail layers. in this case i could see for instance a seam-layer containing all seams (ie.) where two parts of the object mets each other, a nuts and rivets layer, a decal layer (usually on objects there are small printed texts or markings that really makes all the difference to include if you want to achive realism), a layer containing details swiped from photos. <br><br>The advantage of seperating the details in to different layers is that (in photoshop at least) is that you can use different effects for each detail layer. The seams probably will look good with a subtle bevel effect, the rivets might have a discreet drop-shadow and so on.<br><br>The next set of layers is highlight and shadow layers. I use Photoshops blending options (Multiply/Darken and Lighten/Screen). These layers just contain white and black shapes descibing highlight/shadows. By setting the transperency on these layers I can easily adjust how prominent the lighting effects are. This is is important since this has to correlate to the lighting conditions in your entire scene.<br><br>At the top I applie one or more dirt layers. Usually i freehand paint these and mess around with noise filters/transperency settings to get the right feel<br><br>The advantage of this approach is that you easily can create versions of your texture map. Will it look better with or withour dirt. Just hide the layer and save a copy and check it out mapped to your model. Also since you put the color information in as flat,solid colors that you just apply detail/light/dirt to you can easily change the colorscheme by simply adjusting hue on the color layers (Ok, a green gun might not be what you want, but say that you were mapping a car instead)<br><br>Ohh...I feel that I'm starting to ramble. Hope that at least something of what I said is useful to you. It would be interesting to hear what techniques other people use when doing the nitti-gritty work with their texturemaps. I'm always interested in new approaches.<br><br>And If it isn't clear from this message. Creating good texturemaps is HARD work. I would say (for me) the ratio is 30/70 if you look at modelling/texturing. So I would say that it really is in texturing that 'the magic happens'<br><br><br>//PetBom <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There are two ways we percieve that an object is composited of several materials:<br><br>1: The difference in color,texture,shininess between the materials.<br><br>2: But more importantly we see the joints, which is really what tells us what components an object is made of. A joint is identified by the two materials either getting darker or lighter in the seam. (Usually darker). <br><br>So I guess that means you have to accentuate the transitions between the materials by applying either a darker or lighter line in the joint between the two materials, since that is what tells us where a joint is in real life. As I mentioned earlier a subtle bevel/emboss effect on the seam usually gives a good result (since in real life the two edges making up a seam are seldom razor sharp)<br><br>Ok? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
