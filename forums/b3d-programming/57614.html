I think that once graphics get good enough, there is nowhere to go.  DX7 is almost there.  I think it is quite good.

Whith future DX releases, there might be minor speedups or a few new features, but for the most part, I think you could continue to get high quality games from blitz3d.  I have been working on shadows lately, and I REALY want to do them the acurrate way, so that all meshes can can cast on each other and on themselves.  To make this at all reasonable in speed, I need access to the depth buffer.  There are also many other things that you can do quite well now, but if only blitz upgraded to DX8, you could do AMAZINGLY well.  I realy realy like blitz, but I feel just a little bit limitted.  I think that with DX8, I would never feel limited again!  Blitz Reasearch, <b>PLEASE</b> reconsider your decistion to stay with DX7.  DX8 is all that I ask, then I will never whine again! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But with that in mind, I would get Torque + TSE.<br><br>I'm aware that with Blitz you mainly create "gaming experience" and not technology ... but at the moment, one of the main reasons Blitz games look "old rubbish" is that you are forced down to low quality textures because the missing DXTC does not allow you to save 75 - 85% of the actually used VRAM.<br>I'm aware that DXTC has some restrictions, but I don't think that "You can't modify DXTC textures with the regular buffercommands" is really a reason to force Blitz games to crap graphics.<br><br>I'm using Gile[s] and seeing what worlds of difference it makes for your ingame atmosphere if you can use 1024x1024 (supported on any shader capable card so down to GF3) instead of 512 or even 256, I'm quite annoyed about BRLs attitude to this specific topic.<br>For the moment I'm using Toms R2T dll, which uses the regular "Direct3DSurface hack" to get the compressed texture in. Seems like it works stable with ATI and NVIDIA nowadays (older ati drivers had some serious problems).<br><br>I'm aware that you can control what is within VRAM with intelligent techniques, but even if the textures are not in VRAM, they must still be kept in system RAM, and I still think, games forcing 500-800 MB RAM are quite inacceptable in general (there are a few exceptions like Sims 2, that have that much of "always existing" content, that they can't come around it in an intelligent and efficient way) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
