I suspect it may have something to do with the amount graphics card memory the people reporting the problem have.

Do you know the make/model of their cards (and if they're using laptops)?  From what I've seen, on-board video and laptops crop up with video problems (both in Blitz3D and otherwise) more often than desktops with dedicated cards.  But congratulations on obtaining a notebook with the problem - at least now you have something to test on. :)<br><br>As for Hide/Show Entity messing up, could you work around that with zero EntityAlpha?  And if it's a multi-camera problem, perhaps you could just move the single camera away and have it do both tasks (that'd slow things down, but it might work as a "slow but reliable" option). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
