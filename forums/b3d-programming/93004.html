Then the error will either become obvious, or you'll identify it during the elimination process.<br><br>e.g. (create a copy of your project for this):<br><br>(Step 0: Run your code as it is, in order to identify a point where you can reliably replicate the error. It sounds like you've already got this bit.)<br><br>Step 1: Replace all complex media with placeholders. Replace all your meshes with untextured cubes, all your images with blank squares, and comment out any lines loading brushes or animations. Run your code: if it works, the error was in the media; if it doesn't work, go to step 2.<br><br>Step 2: Comment out the purely visual effects. Turn off shadow casters, remove all FastExtension effects and so on. Run your code again: if it now works without any errors, you know to look in the VFX code. If not, go to step 3.<br><br>Step 3: Start removing any references to secondary userlibs one by one (e.g. say you were using three separate userlibs, you'd take three separate steps, each time removing all references to one userlib and trying the program again).<br><br>Step 4: Do the same for any "primary" userlibs that directly affect the way your program works (such as physics engines), and replace them with the bare minimum code required to run the program logic (e.g.if you had a physics-based driving simulation, replace it with simple forward-backward-left-right movement with no collisions).<br><br>Step 5: If you're still getting the error at this point, it's probably a problem with your program logic. Start removing as many individual lines as possible to simplify program structure without changing it (e.g. if you have any text strings left after step 1, remove them now). This will shorten your program and make it easier to analyse the flow.<br><br>Step 6: Trace through everything by hand, preferably using pen and paper.<br><br>Step 7: If you still can't see what's going wrong, post the simplified, shortened code here, and maybe one of the other forum users can help identify the problem!<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2010</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That corrected the unexpected problems. Now the other problem found is that by hooking a camera always make a change of shade in the video options menu and trying to enter the level again unexpectedly quits the application, if the camera hooked the Jeep, everything works fine or if instead leave the system without shadows with the camera hooked everything goes well, another problem is that I have a function that detects collision on the vertices me for the Jeep, and when called a second time closes the application and everything happens loading the first level.<br><br>In conclusion something happens to the shadow system that can not be, but always unexpected output errors point to the quality change of shade and do not know what to do about it. My question is whether other machines in the same or only happen in mine.<br><br>I would like to publish the code of each file so they can see but my taste is pretty, but if necessary I can post it.<br><br>A greeting.<br>Utilizar el Traductor de Google para:Búsquedas<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2010</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Simply end the app where you think the error happens. This way you'll find the command that is causing the problem. When it ends, the error will be one of the following commands, simply move the END one line down, and so on, until the error happens before it ends.<br><br>When an error happens only the second time when a function is called, then it's a bit harder to find the error, you should use a global counter with the function call and END only, when the function was called the second time. This way you can isolate the problem as described before. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
