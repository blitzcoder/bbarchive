No one knew about it. <br>2. although BVM could be used from c++, other languages already have traction there. <br>3. It was always a side project for Régis. <br>4. It was originally written for people who wanted to add scripting to Blitz3d programs. Because B3d doesnt have function pointers, an auto generated bridge is used and that can cause a performance hit depending on the amount of functions you export to bvm. Mark has to share some blame here too because select/case expressions are compiled to nested if's instead of a jump table.  <br>5.

It's not a desirable feature for a scripting language, and mentally switching gears absolutely should be necessary.<br><br>Why? Because scripting is used in two main situations:<br><br>1) where <i>someone else</i> is going to write and mod them. Scripts should be accessible to outsiders, not go out of their way to make it easy to blend with app code at the cost of the main functionality. There should be a hard delineation that encourages to dev to keep their stuff separate and put internal code in the native section. You shouldn't be writing your own scripts.<br><br>2) where the programmer wants to use "two level programming", where you use two languages, usually a C core for performance in the loops and a nice language for the parts that can afford to be slow. In this case being different is the point. (this one is largely irrelevant, not what BVM is really for)<br><br>BVM differs from BlitzMax on point 1: Max is a native language and it doesn't matter if your users don't know it. BVM is a modding language, but your users definitely don't know it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Your third option would be to use a script interpreter implemented in B3D code... don't know of any good ones.

If you were distributing a program in this fashion you might want to do a couple of things: <br><br>1) "Scrub your Inputs" - Parse the user's script files and stop if there are any dangerous commands. File I/O is a good example. You don't want the user to read/write to files. So, you will need to parse and analyze the script files and throw an error on unwanted code. This is totally possible, but the code becomes more complicated and it would muddy up this example. <br><br>2) "Protect your Source" - Find a way to obfuscate you source files in the "source" folder.  This way users can't easily alter the Game's source code. There are many different ways to do this, but they were omitted from the example code for clarity. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
