Take a good look at the character's <b>shadow</b>:<br><br><a href="http://rafael_navega.webs.com/Kiryby64_CollisionMesh.avi" target="_blank">Kiryby64_CollisionMesh.avi</a> - 2.6MB<br><br>The placing of the shadow must have taken into consideration the invisible collision-mesh. <br>The main reason I can think that they'd put such a slope on these stairs would be to make a smoother motion through the steps - if there were no slopes, you'd see the character snapping when getting on top of each step (or being completely blocked by their height).<br><br>If I find other interesting techniques (not from this game but from others as well), I'll try to record them so we can see things in action.<br>Thanks for reading.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It might be interesting to see (via wireframe/changing camera placement) if they actually put this to use -- I think it was intended for Super Mario 64. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That was a lot of fun for me and my friends way back when... 2-player on the PS1 :)<br><br>Anywhoo - LOD techniques are really handy because of course you want to be able to show really nice, detailed and smooth models up-close, but when there's a lot of them, and further away, it's crippling for the processing.<br><br>An example that seems to work flawlessly is that used in the Total War games, the meshes are cut right down and finally dissappear to sprites at extreme range, but up close, fine texturing, animation and light effects are all displayed in all their glory.<br><br>I suppose there's a toss-up along the way between the processing time/power used to effect the LOD transitions and how many levels of detail you may need, but certainly in general doing some tricks in the right circumstance will really make things smoother.<br><br>I've been toying with simple ideas by replacing 3D meshes with simpler sprites at long range, but of course it all very much depends on the circumstances. Some methods (i.e. maybe just swapping for a lower-poly mesh) will work better in some circumstances than others. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

When closer to the foreground, the character has a reddish tint, and you can see he blends with the foreground surroundings.<br><br><a href="http://i55.tinypic.com/3469dgk.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i55.tinypic.com/3469dgk.jpg"></a><br>When I walk slightly back, he penetrates another 'lighting zone' and thus gets tinted with another color. This time, notice how he blends in with the background (which is where you are supposed to head to). <br>If you use a tabbed brower, open each image into different tabs and keep alternating between them to see the difference better (they are hyperlinked for this reason).<br><br>There are more extreme cases throughout the game where the character is in a dark room and heads towards an open area - from a dark tint he goes to a normal one.<br>This is a good way to avoid having to dynamically change the place of your fixed-function lights - you bake the lighting onto your character's mesh per-zone with <a href="/b3ddocs/command.php?name=LightMesh&amp;ref=3d_cat" target="_blank">LightMesh()</a> or use a <a href="/b3ddocs/command.php?name=CreateLight&amp;ref=3d_cat" target="_blank">direct light</a> that is linked to your character and moves with him, changing color depending on the zone (the latter might be a better solution to avoid having statically-lit vertices in animated characters).<br>The torches do have a point light that smoothly lights the main character depending on the distance, but these are <i>very</i> scarce through the levels and other characters and objects aren't influenced by it (notice the barrel - that brown object near the torch - it's right next to it but completely dark).<br><br>This is also interesting to help us realize that even sharp changes to color like these can go unnoticed in the middle of the game, but still help greatly with immersion (the character really looks like is part of a certain room or environment). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Apparently our brains just don't notice it under normal circumstances, and instead interpret it as the character walking out from under a shadow or some such. Didn't know about the LOD, though.<br><br>Speaking of which, that's still being done even by modern games like TrackMania Nations Forever; if you set the track geometry to "Fast," the individual track segments will toggle through at least three different LOD meshes that I've been able to spot. Visual trickery is a wunnerful thing, innit? Oh, and unless I'm mistaken, Banjo-Kazooie also uses LOD tricks with the textures and mesh for the "surroundings" scenery, you know, the stuff that usually makes up the cliff walls or whatever's around the levels. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
