You find G for a particular node/tile by adding the appropriate amount (10, 14 or whatever your costing system is) to the G score of the parent of that node/tile.

Assuming you have already read the A* tutorial and understand 2D A* pathfinding, your question doesn't seem to be about A* pathfinding in general.<br><br>Instead, your question seems to be about how to modify the code of some existing A* examples to fit your game. Confusion about the particulars of the code in those examples, and unfamiliarity with types, seem to be the source of your questions. <br><br>Assuming I am right, I'd suggest contacting the authors of the code examples you are looking at and ask them to help you with the specifics. No one will understand their code better than they do. And no one else has the time or motivation to look at their code more closely.<br><br>Or ... you might just scrap the examples and code up something of your own from scratch. Meanwhile, if you have more general questions about A* or types this is a good place to ask. <br><br>I'm also not sure you really need true 3D pathfinding. It depends on what your game is. If you have a flying game of some kind, where units can fly or levitate and pretty much move in any direction at any time, I can see needing 3D. But usually flying units don't encounter fixed walls or barriers, which makes pathfinding unnecessary. A true 3D pathfinder is more likely to be useful in exploring a building with multiple stories, but even then you could use a 2D pathfinder instead, representing the building in a 3D array but only exploring nodes on another floor where there are connections (elevators, stairs).<br><br>Another variant of 3D pathfinding involves exploring a 2D world with hills and valleys on it. While different nodes may have different heights, this really has more to do with 2D pathfinding than 3D pathfinding. In this case, if you are walking up a hill or something, the 3D distance is a bit further than what it would be if your pathfinding only considered the 2D distance. But the additional cost of the node would have less to do with the small extra distance, and more to do with the additional effort required to move up a hill. This can be more than adequately simulated in a 2D pathfinder through a terrain-based penalty, which I described in that article.<br><br>I hope that helps. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Primarily this is because it takes time to allocate memory every time you create a new node with the New command, and free it up again with the Delete command. This time is very small, true, but when you multiply it across hundreds+ nodes in a single pathfinding attempt, and do path finding for dozens of units in any given frame, it becomes meaningful, particularly on older, slower machines.<br><br>That's why I use arrays for pathfinding. They are faster because once the memory is allocated, you're all set. Also, because the total # of nodes on the map are usually unchanged, you don't need all the benefits of dynamically creating and deleting the nodes.<br><br>If you are targeting more recent machines, and don't really care about the very slight performance hit, use whatever you are most comfortable with.<br><br>PS: Frank, I checked out your 3D proggy. Looks cool. How do you make the little guy move around? The mouse and the arrow keys only seem to move the camera. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In theory, this technique should minimize the processing time because you completely avoid illegal geometry. Another idea to limit the processing time is create a agent processing module. Basically, a server distributes the level geometry between several pcs in which a portion of the level is divided. These agent pcs only perform the image capture on the portion assigned to them. Once complete the Master combines the data from each agent. <br><br>turtle1776 <br> <br>Sorry, I'm not sure whats wrong. But I'm hunting bugs down.
