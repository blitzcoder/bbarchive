Surely Im doing something wrong, you Mac users are not paying those street prices for that are you?  Id like to keep it down around $500, that in the PC world is a 2600XP+, 40GB, 256MB, Nvidia Graphics system complete( no monitor ), so If I can find a Mac of near 2600XP+ performance for about that price, I would be very interested.<br><br><br>Back in the 80s I was a certified MAC technician, and installed lots of hard drive kits in the old MAC systems, no easy feat back then.  In the 90s I wrote Apple off, and if they were smart they would have folded then, but they are a tenacios lot and seem to have finally managed( Im guising thant to iPod ) be stable again.  So, after year of shaking my head at one foolish system release after another, Im looking at the G5 and G6(?), Like the specs, like the looks( but Apple has always been a good looker, it was their limitted OS( tho I admit better than windows) ontop of a dead desire to be incompatable with just about every device  in the world and lousy software support I hated. ).  The problem is those price tags.  It also dosn't help that I can't seem to find any referance to MACs being strong performers in Graphics, I know they used to be the best, but no one seems to be talking about that now.<br><br>Help, info, anything, please... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Ill just have to wait till the PC version is out.  I really can't see any reason to own a Mac on the low and mid end, so It really looks like a poor game market no matter how you slice it.  But since MAX will allow easy compilation to all three, I guess we can compile for mac if we want.  Although, that is not all that is required.  Since support is such a big role for any software, I can see alot of distributors and indies alike avoiding MAC simply because of the lack of knowledge base and the extream cost in hardware to develope that knowledge base.  At least with Linux you get the advantage of no additional software and hardware cost, but still need that knowledge base.<br><br>I see alot of people think they can just recompile to a new platform and gain a new market.  But no one seems to be pointing out the support issues associated with those new markets.  There are alot of reasons why game houses don't do cross platform, its seldome due to development cost, as most of the cost is in media, these days, and that ports just fine in most cases.  The actuall source is C++ and moving from Windows to other platforms is not really that major of a effort.  The biggest problem is that the MAC and Linux markets are just too small to cover the cost of the support they will need, especially the Linux side where, just about, everyone has a unique configuration.<br><br><br>You know that would be a good topic all to itself. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Bleeding edge of games that mac is on eh?<br><br>I'll bet you paid about double what you did for the dell as well.  <br><br>I've used macs for lengthy periods and I have heard constantly from those indoctrinated into the Cult of Jobs about how much faster the mac hardware is and how much better the operating system is...  And I have always had to raise an eyebrow and refrain from smacking them silly.  Excepting the early days when the mac had itself a nice niche market with it's graphics capabilities, it's NEVER outperformed the PC on anything but meaningless benchmarks.  Real world usability tests and speed tests with anything other than an adobe product (and I can't even guarantee that any more) that was optimized really well for the PPC architecture were less than stellar and quite underwhelming in most cases. <br><br>I've NEVER found anything about a mac to really enjoy or like.  The hardware is pretty.  It's got a nice artsy design nowadays.  But usability, stability, compatibility, software selection...  Forget it.<br><br>If I get one, I'll cringe and apologize to whomever I buy it from, feel foolish for doing it...  And it'll just be so I can sucker mac shareware buyers into grabbing a game I write with bmax, because I will know that they will buy it because they have so few choices when it comes to games.<br><br>Kanati<br><br>[edit]<br>hahaha...  As I was writing this a friend happened to glance at it and it turns out that even Adobe stated last year that the claims that Apple had in their benchmarks of their 1.4ghz PPC chip being able to outperform (by 30% or so) the fastest Intel chip on the market (at the time just over 3ghz I think) were false.  And Adobe even went to far at one point to have a "Works best on PCs" page on their photoshop site.  It's pretty bad when even your longtime partner in crime Adobe turns and says "What ARE you smokin' Steve?  Your hardware isn't up to snuff!"<br><br>I'd not have a problem at all if Mac afficianado's would accept the fact that they have good, capable, but behind the curve systems I wouldn't bite back...  But when they state they are the BEST...  I can barely contain my laughter. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
