He can't  - unless he has access to a video monitor system or something.

It would be nice to 'plug in' other engines like physics, bots, etc. each can be managed with a tick or step based time. each frame results in 1 tick.<br><br>As for project design, i think we need to nail down some core deliverables. Realistic things which the core engine requires. ie, frame limiting, or how input will begathered, possibly even the level/environment loading. Items such as pathfinding is important but would be a module for the later phases (that looks very cool btw).<br><br>In the sprit of contribution i have a few suggestions we may want to focus on below:<br><br>* frame limiting/rate - if we set up standards here then each module that uses a frame/tick/turn based rate can then know how much work to do in a single frame. I think that some systems sort of lack that. Ie, if a level was to be loaded, how much do we load. all of it at once. <br>That would mean that the game comes to a stop while we are loading, accessing a large process, or even doing multiple database/network/system api calls.  <br><br>If we agree to use a frame/tick managemnet system as the core, and we set this as a standard, then all the modules can use that. This can also be used as sort of a pseudo multi threading system where each module can perform part of its complete action. <br><br>The benifit of using this as a standard is that even if we don't build modules that use the, we will experience no downside.<br><br>Thoughts? or am i just rambling? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Pathfinding heuristics can be used to determine items closer to the bot and select dependent on that value.

I'm using ellipsoid-vs-polygon, apparently EntityCollided() is detecting collision between my worker pivot and level geometry when it should not. This results in an error. I haven't quite figured it out, but, seeking a workaround. I could a use 'Collision Map'. The problem is this is only good for static obstacles, not very good for moving obstacles. A hybrid may be necessary in order to work around the collision bug.<br><br>I have decided to use Precalculated PathTables for long  'permanent' paths and Realtime Pathfinding for short dynamic collision avoidance. Pathtables simply store a list of waypoint IDs in a bank and assign the bank handle to a PathTableArray(StartWaypointID,GoalWaypointID). The challenge will be to automate generation of waypoints and paths. This will require a utility of some sort. I would like to avoid manually placing waypoints at all cost:)<br><br>The first idea is to use the Pathfinder to navigate through the level creating paths from specific objects placed in the level. But, I must solve the collsion bug.<br><br>The second idea is to use the Waypoint Recorder. Using the Waypoint Recorder will require one to navigate through the level from various locations which could be tideous dependent on the size of the level. Game Entities that move on a tracks can benefit from the use of the waypoint recorder.<br><br>The third idea is to drop a 'blanket' of Waypoints from the top of the level. Using gravity and collision these Waypoints should fall and land on the level geometry at appropiate height. Waypoints out of bounds are removed. Once the waypoints are in place, use the Pathfinding Algorithm generate paths from waypoint to waypoint.<br><br>Either way scale and item placement will be crucial. Assuming that we all agreed on the '1 Blitz Unit = 1 Meter' rule this shouldnt be a problem. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

All the seashells that do not land on the sandcastle are removed.

You should implement a feature that will<br>-position a marker when it hits the ground<br>-continue seeking for the next lower floor until it's out of the meshes Y-minimum.<br><br>If both things are implemented, it will be a one-click job, and everything can be automated, including pathfinding etc.<br><br>What do you think? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
