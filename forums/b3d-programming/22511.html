I find that having code with no models is kind of depressing :)  I am an Architect Student and I have done 3d models for a few years now. Recently I began doing low polygon models to play with, and I find I am good at it. What I would like to know is if anyone in the blitz community thinks it would be a good idea to set up a website that sells low polygon models for cheap?  I bought the domain name lowpolyshop.com, and I am considering putting some stuff together mainly for games. If there is a demand for this, I will focus a lot of my energy in this direction. Also I would be looking for others to add collections for sale, as well as give away some free models. My question(s) are this. a) Is this a good idea? b)what should be included-- texture? animations?  Please give me feedback here c)would custom character design appeal to anyone? :) If there is big demand, I start right away.  Thanks! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So many possibilities.  Thanks for the suggestions so far! It sounds like this should be a go. Also, I was thinking of offering various ranges of detail for the models, none being over 800. Maybe the same model could be offered in 200, 400, or 800 , depending on the detail you want or the speed you want in your game? Of course 200 count would need an incredibly UV map to strut its glory :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Bombone, I don't know if you have ever done a character model but it takes a LOT of time.  Remember, besides the model you have to do textures (this is the most time consuming part really) and animation.  While you can (and should) start with a smaller library of the most common characters people would want and add additional models over time to fill out the library, even an initial rollout of ten characters (about the minimum I would consider to start such a store) will take a lot of work to prepare.<br><br>To give you some numbers, creating a character model of high quality so that people will want to purchase it will take several days working full time (longer if you're working part time and/or you haven't done many character models before.)  Thus between now (and I mean RIGHT now, if you started today) and August, assuming you are doing this full time AND already have skill/experience creating low pol characters, you would really have to hustle in order to complete 10 characters.  And even then the models may not be good enough to sell if you weren't very good at character models to begin with.<br><br>To give you some reference on quality, look in the Interactive section of my website.  If/when I get around to creating my store I'll be shooting for a level of quality similar to the Organist but at a minimum the Motorbike Rider is probably high enough quality to sell. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I have been doing 3d modeling in Architecture for 3 years now and have played with modeling a year or two before that. I have recencly started character modeling when I decided I wanted to learn to write games as a hobby. I am interested in making character modeling my profession since I really enjoy doing it a whole lot. I have made a couple models in the last few weeks and was surprised at the results. One of the characters I made was an Easter Island statue, nicely textured, in about 8 hours. The result was that the model look exactly like the picture and I was very impressed. I believe the years of modeling Architecture helped me really understand the world of 3d, so I should not have much problem. Also since I have been texturing buildings very carefully (not just slapping on a repeated texture), I find texturing a character is a similar process. The only department that needs study is the animation part. Last week I created an animated spider and I think the results were pretty good. I am surprised at the response this forum has received in a day. Perhaps my idea to do this professionally is possible. <br><br>I would also like to know what types of animations are common? It helps from the start to understand the minimum requirements so you can go beyond! Thanks again everyone. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
