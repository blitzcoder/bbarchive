Generally they involve some specific feature with people arguing that Blitz doesn't have it so it sucks and other people responding that feature isn't important.  What I've not seen, and what I am trying to get at here, is what features Blitz has that no other game dev system supports.<br><br>To get the ball rolling here's one cool thing Blitz can do which I don't think any other game dev system can do.  Because of the very powerful and flexible texturing control in Blitz you can change textures on any wall within your game independent of the lightmap.  I'm doing this in my latest project.  In most other game dev systems you can't change level textures at all at run-time (because they are "baked" into the BSP, etc.) let alone do it while preserving the pretty lightmaps.<br><br>Can you think of any other game dev systems where this is possible?  I've never looked into the run-time texture capabilites of DarkBasic so that might be one.  I'm pretty certain tools like Torque and 3DGS cannot do this. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

While I *love* Basic-based languages (and have since the early 80s), they tend to be slow.  A couple of years ago when I was debating whether to go with BlitzBasic, DarkBasic, Visual C++, or stick with VisualBasic which I already owned, I ran an integer and float speed test.  VC++ did the best, of course (but I can't *stand* C-based languages for high-level uses: they're fine for writing mouse drivers and the like, but *suck* for high level uses like games).<br><br>Visual Basic ran at 1/20 that speed.  Dark Basic ran at 1/5 the speed of VB - 1/100 the speed of VC++.  However, Blitz ran 10x faster than VB: it ran at 1/2 the speed of VC++; 10x the speed of VB; 50x the speed of DarkBasic: *that* was what sold me on Blitz! (for math: obviously graphic operations are much more dependent on the hardware installed than on the language.)<br><br>Since then, I've sort of followed the competition while coding in Blitz.  Blitz3D does have its limits on cutting-edge special effects, but they're more than made up for by the horrible code contortions that other languages *require* to do the simplest things (like create and show a 3D scene).<br><br>I've seen other "3D game languages," and they force you to follow their limited selection of setups.  Blitz provides much more flexibility.  Notwithstanding future language extensions, Blitz as it is now provides a fantastic framework for game designers to easily express their ideas, at high speed, and those future language extensions will only let it go further... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Speed is great. But I'd have to go with flexibility. It's a bit vague, and probably not as specific as the topic was intending, but it's the reason I still pick Blitz over Quest3d. I think the speed, feature set and image quality of Quest3d is astonishing, the stability seems excellent, and it's very reasonably priced too. But what's the point if your hands are tied almost as much as if you're working with 3dRad or 3dGamestudio?<br><br>With Blitz, I can jump in and get my hands dirty with textures and vertices at any time, with created or loaded meshes. I think DBPro allows you to manipulate meshes directly now (?) but it's always been one of my favourite features. I remember being loathe to do it at first, and sticking to loading meshes, but it's amazing how much more flexibile everything gets when you first start dabbling with real time mesh deformation. ( If you're new and haven't done it, go and give it a try. It's great. ) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But let's have a fresh start over, yes?  Let's pretend you're a different Miraj and I'm a different jhocking from those forums.<br><br>I'm no longer perusing the 3DGS forums (except when referred to specific threads/posts; a couple of the clients I am working with are still using 3DGS, like Ken/Nardulus with his fishing game.)

Not to criticize anyone but my original post was specifically to avoid this sort of vague "Blitz is good" stuff and try to tease out specific features Blitz has that competitors do not.  I agree with you all that the stability, speed, and flexibility are huge advantages but apparently a lot of people are only interested in features, hence the DarkBASIC userbase.  As I pointed out however there are things Blitz can do which no other game dev system can so let's compile a list of unique features. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
