I was thinking about doing rendering the image with no lighting or texturing(maybe have a shadow version of the model with lower poly) and replacing the light position with a camera pointing at the mesh and nothign else around it, turning that into a texture and then using some collision with the environment to place the shadow spirte down.  <br><br>I can't access the internet so i'll need some conceptual stuff and process code for my friend to print it out.  Sorry guys.  I can still program tho :-D.<br><br>So can u help me out? thanks. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There are some examples in the code archives. Sswift is offering a good Shadow system. All dynamic shadow systems I've seen in blitz are based on software solutions, rendering to a texture etc. You can use it if you have a limited number of Shadow Casters and lights, but as soon as you want to use it with dozens of lights and chars it may be too slow.<br><br>I tried it, fully implemeted Sswifts shadow system in my fps engine, but in the end I decided not to use it because it isn't its domain. I do now use simple heavily blurred pseudotextures, a bit like in GTA.<br><br>Sswifts system is good for things like beating up games that take place on a small stage with a low number of characters, eg. tekken-like stuff. Yu could also use his system with a single light only, eg. the sunlight. THis would still be pretty fast, even with a higher number of character. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It can either be rendering the shadow textueres, or it can be culling the polygons, or it can be uploading the new meshes to the 3D card.  I wonder if perhaps I should create a built in profiler to tell you how much time each section takes.<br><br>In Jedive's case, sounds like the number of polygons in the level is the problem.  There's two ways to fix that.  Either  you split your level up into multiplie entities, or I write something into the system for handling static receivers which breaks stuff up internally to speed culling.<br><br>So you see, the system's not unusable in that case.  Jedive just didn't want to subdivide his level to help it out. :-)<br><br>Anyway the only thing I can't really optimize is the cost for rendering the shadows.  That is just a matter of 3d cards being slow to copy from the screen to a texture buffer.   But part of the reason I can't optimize that further is because I can't get enough information about animated character to avoid rendering a new shadow texture every frame. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
