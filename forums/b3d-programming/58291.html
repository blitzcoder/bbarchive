Occasionally, and seemingly randomly (every time I build it occurs at a different time - perhaps due to the random seed being different) the game gives me an 'attempt to access null object / method' error when I call:<br><br>If goallist.Contains(CONSTANT)<br><br>In the debugger, I can see that the right value is passed (a constant representing a goal) in the AI method which calls contains, and the list both exists and contains object[s].  However, the odd thing is that the link being tested in the Contains() method appears to be a TImageFont, and has a null value!<br><br>Any ideas at all about this, as I'm really scratching my head.  It's being passed the correct stuff, but it thinks the object's value is null. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I have just reposted it, and in the wrong forum again!  <br><br>Oops...  Moderators!<br><br> But this is what I posted, and has more info...<br><br>(Having said that I'm going to try the wrapper idea, as that seems to be the answer!)<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I really am at my wits end with this problem, and I honestly don't know whether to post it here or in the bug reports!<br><br>I am using Bmax v1.10 on OSX 10.3, and don't yet want to move to the next version.  But perhaps it could solve it, and I will try if nothing else works.<br><br>Basically, I am using a TList in my AI that contains goals (integer constants), and calling methods such as contains() to see which goals are further down the line.  I only ever call these methods on a non-null, non-empty list with the integer constant as the 'value:Object' parameter.<br><br>It always crashes on contains(), with a 'null object / method' error.  As far as I can tell (although I can't be certain as I usually run non-debug for speed.  Another odd problem in this game is the huge difference in speed between these modes, something I didn't have with previous games, some more graphically intensive.)<br><br>What I can see in the debugger is that the correct values are held in the AI's methods, that the list exists and is not empty, and here's the killer...<br><br> ... contains() seems to be looking for the existence of a TFont, and one with no 'value field'!<br><br>It doesn't always crash, different things seem to trigger it, even adding a completely unconnected line of code can solve it - until I type more (unrelated) code that throws it again.  I haven't altered the AI code at all, besides double-checking all the references to the list in it.<br><br>Can anyone help me?  I could really use some new lines of thinking, as I really have explored all avenues.  Perhaps there is some kind of memory leak, and things are being overwritten, but I wouldn't know what to look for.  I had no such problems in my scrolling platform game, and have used much the same framework.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Sonic. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
