See below ***<br><br><br>Before anyone says it, YES, I am fully aware that there is no command for this in Blitz3D.<br><br>However, I've been having some fun recently poking around (heh) with the structures of various objects in Blitz3D. Thanks to Billp and MixailV (<a href="/posts.php?topic=79848#896838" target="_blank">this</a> and <a href="http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?prev=hp&amp;hl=en&amp;js=n&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fblitz.pp.ru%2Fforum%2Fshowthread.php%3Fs%3Dbf60b1c29ecce245be45aa7d33b183f3%26threadid%3D203&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en" target="_blank">this</a>) I've been able to find a few useful (for my purposes, anyway) speed enhancements, by combining this information with the ability to peek and poke directly to memory pointers with a DLL (both of their DLLs allow this).<br><br>One idea that amuses me is to pack all my media into archives. Very original. Now the standard way to do this with B3D files is to extract a temporary file and then load it with LoadAnimMesh. This is all very good and practical, but because I am incredibly stubborn I am still wondering if I can use the aforementioned peeking and poking commands to create an animated B3D in code, out of a bank (having read that from an archive, or being me, read it from a B3D file and doing this bit for kicks). The diagrams supplied by MixailV make it pretty clear where the bone weights are stored, but I haven't worked out how to actually make this work. So far, I have tried this:<br><br><pre class=code>
box=CreateCube()
PositionEntity box,0,15,0
ScaleMesh box,7,7,7

bone1=CreatePivot(box):PositionEntity bone1,0,7,0

s=GetSurface(box,1)

vertexptr=MemoryFastPeekInt(s+28)  
For ver=0 To 3
	v=vertexptr+64*ver
	
	MemoryFastPokeByte(v+44,1)  ;Bone number?
	MemoryFastPokeFloat(v+48,1)  ;Weight?
	
	MemoryFastPokeInt(box+$2C,1)  ;On the offchance this might do anything
Next
</pre><br><br>Moving the pivot has no effect. Does anyone know if bones are some kind of special entity class that can't easily be created from code? I always thought they were just pivots. And does anyone know what the one-byte number for bone ID actually represents and how to get it? I thought it would be the child index but this didn't seem to work. I thought the value at entity+$2C might be some kind of update flag like surface+64 apparently is, but this also didn't help.<br><br>I didn't see anything in MixailV's table of the mesh/entity structure that indicated Blitz3D stores a distinction between entities created with CreateMesh and LoadAnimMesh, although there's still a lot of white space on that table. On the Vertex structure table he does point out that vertex+48 is either the first bone weight or, "for normal vertices", the parent surface - again, does this mean vertices and surfaces loaded as part of an animated mesh are somehow different from those created using Blitz3D commands, and that there is possibly no way to convert one to the other?<br><br>Sorry to ramble, or if I've missed something obvious. It's getting late here.... heh. Thanks for your attention! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Basically the deformed vertex positions are offset a second time - say in the simplest case, you have a cube and the only bone is the cube's root itself. If you position the cube at 10,10,10, normally you would expect the verts to be surrounding that point (9,9,9; 11,11,11 etc.). However, at the moment, the root pivot's offset seems to be being applied to the vertices a second time, so the cube ends up being rendered at 20,20,20. Other than this it works - taking this into account, the offsets for child bones are generally correct - so if the top half of the cube is attached to "bone1" and this is hovering gently at local position 0,1,0 the cube will still be cube-shaped, not brutally skewed - but it will be twice as far away as you want it to be!<br><br>There are of course a couple of obvious solutions - position the objects at 50% of where you want them, don't make the bones children, etc - but this isn't how it's done by the LoadAnimMesh models so I really don't want to make things messier than they already are (not to mention, on point of principle you shouldn't patch a problem you don't understand until you do).<br><br>Even if this is resolvable, there's another point to consider, which is that while bones as it happens are just pivots (they can even be meshes if you want), the bone transforms list and animator objects list are created by the LoadAnimMesh command - they don't exist for static meshes. This is easy enough to get around by creating a bank and redirecting the mesh to look for the information in the bank data (having Poked it into the bank) but it does mean that memory leaks will occur if things aren't freed carefully - and it may be unstable as this isn't how the system was meant to work (resizing a bank after adding it as a list would completely break it).<br><br>I'll tidy up my experiments and post them shortly, but they won't make much sense unless you have either access to the B3D source or a very good instinct for guessing memory structures (hint: MikhailV's tables are only about 90% correct).<br><br>I strongly recommend that if you need this functionality for anything other than purely academic interest or fun (my motivation) you should use miniB3D, which being written in the same language as the program using it, is easy to mod this way.<br><br>(EDIT2: removed this codebox so nobody gets the wrong code by mistake) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

</textarea><br><br>Remember to free boned entities with FreeBoneEnt and not FreeEntity, as the latter will cause a memory leak. If you want to load meshes out of a bank, there are more efficient ways of doing this (start by sizing the bank correctly from the outset!) although how precisely will depend on the format of the data in the bank.<br><br>I hope this all works, and if it does - have fun! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Is it really faster than native B3D bone animation (I spy a VertexCoords, that's a slow command...)? I think I get what you're doing but am not sure... also, not having a .b3x file to test it with makes it a little difficult.<br><br>I saw it a couple of months ago but couldn't make head or tail of it then either... which is actually why I first made a vertex animation system and then this little adventure into "real" bones.<br><br>@Warner - done. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

For each instance of the figure the skeleton is set at the appropriate point of that animation and the matrix information is extracted for the bones of the skeleton and applied to the vertices. Move on to the next figure, set, extract, apply, etc. So the basis of the system is that there is one reference skeleton only, that provides matrix information to move the vertices for many 'figures' that seem to be controlled by their own individual bones. I'm not sure how it rates in a straight shoot out between a single native b3d animation and this system for a single 'figure' but I'm predicting this system's slower :0), but in a shoot out between 100 b3d animations and this system.....<br><br>Drawbacks are that you need a lot of control and direction ie you need transition anims like stand_to_walk, walk _to_stand, etc.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>GrumpyOldMan <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

A single reference bone... brilliant idea. The high surface count was the last obstacle to creating a usable vertex-animation system (got past the slowness of VertexCoords by doing that part in a DLL, more direct accessing nonsense).<br><br>Now.... combining this with "pure" vertex animation, and the ability to add and drop characters (and their reference bones) at will thanks to developments higher up in the thread... and it may actually be possible to equal the speed of MD2s with mesh quality that doesn't suck...<br><br>Thank you very much for sharing that! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
