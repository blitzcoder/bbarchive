Gabriel - I should have thought of trying it with debug on, usually I do use debug but for some reason I hadn't used debug mode while testing the particular level set that had an odd number of grid squares.  Just tried it with debug mode on and got an "offset out of range" error on that particular level.  I am kind of amazed though that for all the times I've played the game that bug has only caused 3 crashes , but then it was only a single byte that had changed.  <br><br>jfk - I only accessed the bank out of bounds once per level on which the level had an odd number of grid squares (because I am using half-bytes to store some information when there is an odd number of grid squares I'd forgotten that I need to add 1 to the total bank size)<br><br>Anyway, thanks again. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
