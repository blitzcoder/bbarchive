Unfortunately I don't want to give too much away at this point as I’m thinking that this could, potentially, maybe, be profitable! And if not, I still think this will be a great project to work on.<br><br>I'm looking for a Blitz3D coder with reasonable stills to work along side me. I myself have little Blitz3D stills, but do have Blitz2D knowledge, also my profession is software engineering, but mainly use C, so I just need to get up to speed with the language.<br><br>Before anyone asks, I’m not after someone to do this project for me. I'm a very hands on person and will be involved every step of the way. But need another programming to help me for 3 reasons.<br><br>1) To learn the language more.<br>2) There’s too much work for one person.<br>3) I have much more motivation when working with other people.<br><br>A little about the game (but without giving too much away):<br>Its a RTS style game, where you control a small group of characters. The principle of the game is very simple, but, like lemmings for example, is extremely addictive. As I say, I don't really want to give too much away until I have found someone who seams fairly keen and, ideally, lives near Brighton, UK (I say this because I like to occasionally have meetings and also find it easier to communicate ideas when meeting in person) But if your interested and not near Brighton, still feel free to contact me and we will see what we can do.<br><br>There are 2 other guys already working with me. A guy who’s doing the music (we hope to re-mix the original), some sound effects and a little 3D modelling, and another guy who will hopefully be helping with level creation, 3D modelling, and has an interest in physics and is good moral support lol.<br><br>We already have a private forum set up for this project where we discuss ideas and keep our own worklogs.<br><br>So anyone who might be interested, please contact me on chris@... and I can tell you a little more.<br><br>Cheers. I'm sure there will be plenty more posts from me with coding questions lol. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Thanks for your comments tho.<br><br>Becky Rose, I work as a software developer by trade (but unfortunately we code mainly in C!) and the projects I work on would be near impossible for one coder to complete in a sensible amount of time.<br><br>The way I play to divide the work up would be to get a simple framework for the game to work on (ie, simple movement and simple level design) then get the different people to implement different functionality (such as AI, navigate, weapons, menu systems etc). I think your right in that by having 2 coders (for example) you wouldn't double productivity as one person would have to keep track of things and put it all together, but I think it would increase productivity by 50%! Then any other coders after that would add an extra 60%-70% (assuming you don't have loads of coders, because then you need several project manager lol, anyway im only after 1-2 people).<br><br>Peoples thoughts on managing projects would be interesting!<br><br>Nexic, thanks for that information, that very interesting. I think i will look into this a little more. If you have any links tha might help that would be great. If I do find anything interesting out i post it in a new forum for others to read in the hope it will help them.<br><br>Sledge, thanks for that link, its quite an interesting read.<br><br>Cheers all <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
