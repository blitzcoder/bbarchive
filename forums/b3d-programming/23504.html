A placement editor (ie. you can't create or edit meshes but you can load and place existing meshes) is easy enough.  Anything beyond that, if you are asking this you don't have enough knowledge yet (sorry.)<br><br>To create a placement editor you only need a few basic functions.  One to load levels (most likely using a custom file format; read up on the file commands in the command reference,) one to save levels, one to load objects, one to move objects, one to delete objects, and that's about it.  You just load objects, use CameraPick to select them with the mouse, move them around, and then save their filenames and coordinates to a file.  In your game you load the objects based on the level file, placing them at the saved coordinates.<br><br>For your editor's GUI (eg. buttons to load and save) you should get one of the free GUI libraries floating around.  I recommend BBGui but a lot of people like Xlnt GUI. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's pretty basic, as it just loads or creates primitives that are positioned/rotated/scaled/alphaed/textured. I'm also going to have two file formats. *.cscen and *.scen. The *.cscen will be the compiled scenario file, containing the raw PRSAT data, while the *.scen file will contain the individual steps to create the data. I have one command so far that would show it's data in the *.scen file and not the *.cscen file. It's a command that aligns an object to the level. this just changes it's position.<br> <br>anyway, enough about my editer. as far as Npcs go, what kind of AI npcs are you doing? enemies? townspeople? allies? In the case of enimies, a lot of times it is safe to create some basic enemy behavior functions that make dicisions upon the enemies AI settings, the enemies enviornment, and the enemies status.  <br><br> For instance, somthing in the files says that the enemy patrols several specific points. The player is not detected in the local enviornment, and enemy didn't see the player recently. The function would then lookup the enemies movement speed and turning speed, and begin patroling. then, lets say the player came around the corner in front of the enemy. The function would look up the enemies reaction time, and switch mode from patroling to engaging player once the reaction time was up. the enemy might then have an accuracy setting that represents how accuratly it shoots.        <br><br>townspeople might have a file with dialog, answers to questions, as well as commands to modify the players status, for instance taking away 5 gold and giving an item.<br><br>I don't know much about programming allies, but I figure that it is a more sophesticated version of an enemy. Perhaps a mix of townsperson and enemy AI with the ability to take commands.<br><br>other than that, good luck. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Coding "HomeSpun" helped me understand a lot of things about Blitz. The good thing is you can start real basic and then add everything you think of as you go. I'm still working on it here and there. Problem is the things I want to add now will take more time,thought and energy than I have to devote to it. Ah well...someday I'll get back to it. The cool thing with HomeSpun is not only can you save the worlds but the editor outputs complete game code in first and third person mode.<br><br>You can download a copy at the Blitz Showcase and the "loader" code for the levels will reveal how to code the "save" functions if you can look at them and then reverse the process.

I don't which to code it althoghter as it will make it very difficult, rather if I can code a Player or player object, an A.I. N.P.C., and a vehicle that can be used by both then I can put in things like hovercraft tanks, hover tanks,  wheeled tanks , tracked tanks, hover bikes, airplanes, space planes, massive starships, compound heilcopters, E.T.C. all that the pplayer or A.I N.P.C's can eject in or out of and also get in or out of.<br><br><br>What I want my world or placement editor to do is to be capable of exporting code to each entity separately without me having to put include world instructions in the brain or is that not possible?<br><br>Also I want my editor to be capable of being able to sustain whole cyber planets, Earth sized and larger.<br><br>I will investigate this Homespun and see if that can do the job for me as well I hope it helps me to eventually learn how to code my own world editor as well. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If the Control_Type were "human" for example then you would overide the computer control with the Player controls but using the limits held in the type structure for that vehicle.<br><br>I know this is very vague and is probably not what you are looking for but its a start.<br><br>P.S. I remember in a previous post a while back I said I would show you a demo of some combat code and jumping into and ejecting from craft.

I look forward to seeing this demo and code and I now have  an old Saitek X36T &amp; X35f H.O.T.A.S Joystick and throttle system with rudders and a new Thrustmaster Afterburnber USB Forcefeedback H.O.T.A.S system and they now work a treat with my new motherboard.<br><br>Sybixsus, I have worked with that concept for quite a while now and while the engine and engine makers themselves behave foolishly with their engine by not really proper developing on the concept, nevertherless I do like the concept of what 3D RAD does(even if the programmers try to be demi gods) and I think it would be pointless to say I programme a flight simulator, if I can reuse it to do a space combat sim or even another flight sim, apart from a few minor adjusments, then the engine is reusable again rather than waste time programming another engine for a similar game or if I wish to include in a 1st person shooter flight elements, why reprogramme the whole thing again from scratch whereas if you have something like that where all the joystick axises are there if the player has H.O.T.A.S, if not , it can be controlled by just a joystick or a keyboard and mouse(which how I play most of my 1st person shooters like Quake3 and Unreal Tounament and Unreal Tournament 2003)a dnyou can have a in and out control and other things like eject control and have them in separate parts and use them when required I think it would cut down development time .<br><br>Listen everyone , I know a certain publisher is very interested in my idea's so I would really like some help please, I have requested a team before and hopefully I will get one, if this sounds like a very interesting concept, please get in touch I really also want to make this type of engine so if anyone is interested, please say so on this thread, <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
