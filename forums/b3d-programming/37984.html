Cheap in terms of their real value and their price. Most games I see are up to $20 (US) with art and code one could make in a few weeks. My question is - Why do you people do this instead of make BIG games?<br><br>My understanding is that you can make much more money if you invested say 1 year into making a kickass game or any kind of software for that matter (in Blitz) and sold it for only $50 where you would be able to compete with "AA" titles! Personally, I estimate most of us could make a "AAA" game, a top commercial success which you could live on and maybe sell in stores if you devoted 2-4 years of work, alone or with a team maybe 1-2 years. The only larger projects i have seen so far that are at least actively on the forums are halos WW2 thing, and i also consider the tokamak engine to be a semi-big deal. Is it that most of you need less money but need it FAST or is it that you are just not confident in your abilities to sell and undertake in general such a big project? You need artists? You have other things you do? I'd just like to know, cos it makes much more sense (to me) to go for less bigger titles, if you can stand the tension caused by the amount of risk you are taking. I also believe that if you test your games extensively, design them extremely carefully, and keep the most important thing in mind - how the Player percieves the game and how his brain reacts to the "fun" you are trying to create - then there is nearly no risk and it all comes down to work and more work.<br><br>Personally, I am still unsure wether to go for 1 huge project that i have in mind for a very long time and that i know would work out, only because: well, i need less money fast... :\<br><br>How about you? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Sorry, but most people here are NOT capable of producing AAA games. That's not to be negative or critical.. most people everywhere are not capable. I really don't think you understand just how much media is required to make a big game, just how many people are involved and just how good the quality needs to be. Ignoring code complexity and Blitz's ability to cope with large projects, and simply working on art alone, there are very few games around here that could compete with AAA retail titles.

I'd suggest having a go at a few small projects and see how you do, also, the more projects you do the better your programming becomes.<br><br>For example: My Lander project is/was a biggy, and also my first in blitz, I've re-written it from scratch at least 3 times now and currently it needs a re-write.<br><br>Another problem many of us have is 'feature creep' as your coding you come up with another idea... and another idea... and another... and guess what... you never ever finish the game.

Particularly for a engine that renders as few polys as blitz does.<br><br>Half the art and design stuff, are things you the player will never actually see, but these things take a lot of time. Optimizations take a lot of time. Often for me creating an art asset is relatively quick, optimizing it can take as long again.<br><br>In Aerial Antics we wanted dynamic shadows, and that required a lot of experimental coding plus dozens of hidden proxy collisions that would conform to the terrain enough to recieve shadows and be used for collisions. This part took about half as long as creating all the visuals. And thats just one thing out of dozens.<br><br>Blitz is capable of making a AA quality game of perhaps 1-2 years ago in the graphics side of things.

Aside from FPS, only maybe simulations would require awesome-ish graphics, while in other games art, the physics (which you were talking about) and such things that blitz isn't top notch at, can be ignored to a great extent if there is something to cover it.

Unless you've grown up through the initial inception and evolution of computer/video games, I think we've all thought the way you are Lenn. In addition, I agree with you. Many of the games created by blitz users COULD be cloned in a few weeks.<br><br>WarrenM put it perfectly however, you're missing the bigger pictures. Creating those games has been such an iterative process, and so many times the amount of work and effort which makes those games play so well is what you'll never see. When it comes to games, it truly is the quality of what you reject that makes them either classics or somehow awkward working prototypes which have/had 'potential'.<br><br>I'm the first to admit I haven't done much around this blitz community, and I double many people (if any) even know me. I do hope that to change in the far future, as I've decided to hang back a bit until I see what blitzmax has to offer (yeah yeah) and in the mean time work on designs, concepts and small personal prototypes in a range of different languages. Nobody will ever see what work, and yet I hope it will be what makes my final products stand out.<br><br>The thing I've done that I'm most proud of in blitz is a pencil rendering demo, only to have someone beat me to releasing one by a few days (which incidentally was quite similar in code and structure, however his presentation with the sketchbook was better). It doesn't matter though, because I learnt so much in doing it. I can't speak for the person who did that demo, but I certainly didn't arrive at that solution instantly. Sure we all could clone that demo in a night or two, but initially coming up with the concept and cultivating it into something which works is another story.<br><br>My version began with using a pencil texture mapped to all the geometry in an attempt to rotate it depending on the perspective of each tri relative to the camera. Pretty stupid now looking back, but it was where I began as I wanted pencil lines in different directions and wanted their width to scale based on distance from the camera. Obviously I never got it fully working, but in trying it I realised...lines going in all the directions were so distracting that they actually took away from the depth and believability of the world, rather than add to it. To cut this short, I eventually ended up with a single overlay attached to the camera, etc etc. Yet in doing so I learnt a lot about design and rendering concepts. It's that process which developers go through which makes knocking off games in a week unfeasible.<br><br>However...if you do happen to have the vision to see the perfect solution the first time...can I work with you? I believe that blitz currently is capable of great things, but managing the project is quite difficult as it grows. I also believe this will soon change. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I call it codesketching.<br><br>Your 50 page design document will probably go out the window.  Quite a few people on Garage Games that have completed published work like Adrian, Joe (Think Tanks) and I were giving advice about those things.  Basically, give yourself a 1-2 page outline.  Prototype the game concept and see what ends up being fun.  Write down the end vision but not in too much detail and then make day to day checklists or worklogs like GFK mentions in his newletter interview.  These more managable things will help you get your project done quicker and better than an enormous design doc.<br><br>In fact it was agreed in this other debate that a very detailed design document is only good for:<br><br>A.

But the actual game is rarely written is stone. In my eperience the design doc usually outlines stuff that the publisher has agreed on and lists the things that absolutely must be completed in sequential milestones, to leave something out means not getting paid till you reach the next one.<br><br>It's also insurance for the developer, as the basic game design is allready laid out, they aren't going to be forced into missing deadlines for things that weren't in the design doc. When your working in a tightly scheduled release and budget, you need all the help you can get to button down exactly whats expected of you.<br><br>So the purpose of a design doc doesn't allways have much to do with the game outside of laying down the rules, and what absolutely must be done for the developer to complete a project, and in what time frame. <br><br>Any additions and changed have to be negotiated, and its here that the developer gets the opportunity to add time and put back dates without losing money.<br><br>Not quite as important for Indie games, as your typically your own boss, and get to make all the decisions within members of your team. <br><br>But for a commercial project it really helps a lot. Both the publisher and developer know what they are getting, and what they need to achieve from the start. And it reduces risk for both parties. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Or a developer comes up with a great Idea, Marketing get scared about the risks, and take over the game design with statistics.<br><br>It's all about money and a little about games in the commercial workd, if your lucky to be a game god, you get to do whatever you like, at least untill you fail once or twice. But most don't get that luxury, fail once and your probably not going to get another chance.

(When I say "big" -- it takes a playtester who knows exactly how to solve every quest about 10-12h to play through it at top speed; it generally takes 24-48h of solid play for a player starting cold to finish it assuming they don't get stuck. That's more content than most commercial titles -- and you're not walking back and forward through mazes to flip switches.)<br><br>We'd initially estimated it would take us six months to complete; it ended up taking three years. I'd say that if we'd been working on it full time it would have taken 18 months.<br><br>1) We had an extraordinarily talented programmer: Andrew Barry. (Think of him as the Mark Sibly of Mac development tools; among other things he wrote RealBasic 1.x and 2.x and the Spotlight Debugger.)<br><br>2) We had two talented artists.<br><br>3) The standard of quality of computer games back in 94 was FAR lower than it is today. Today's games have FAR more content and far better architected engines.<br><br>Our game had 1400 map layouts, three internal scripting languages (items were scriptable, so were map objects -- e.g. monster spawns were invisible scripted map items, doors were visible scripted map items -- and so was npc behavior), a system for handling conversation data, and allowed NETWORK cooperative play (up to four players). We had real content development tools (in fact we made our content development tools available to our players). It won a number of awards, was reviewed in every high profile Macintosh magazine, was distributed on a LOT of cover disks (back when cover disks were fairly novel)...<br><br>I think we made a total of $30,000 from it (split three ways).<br><br>Typical triple-A titles today cost $5M. Ten years ago it was  $1M. Ten years earlier it was probably $100k or less. Ten years before that it was something a good hacker could knock together in a couple of weeks given enough coffee (literally -- read the history of Sierra Online or Origin).<br><br>Most triple-A titles LOSE MONEY. Being a game programmer is the geek equivalent of forming a rock band: most people do it for love; a small proportion of rock bands ever get a paid gig; a tiny proportion make real money at it; the average professional musician doesn't earn enough to live on from music and has a "day job". This includes rock musicians and members of symphony orchestras. And guess what, the same is true for game programmers. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It is possible only in theory if the person worked around 12 hours a day on it, which is rarely feasable. So yeah, i was wrong there.<br><br>Jeremy, i mix both of what you said. The design doc is purely designed to test gameplay, such as "if this feature is in, then noone will build this kind of space ships cos it does not pay off" , it is basically calculations to balance it all and also make it fun. Fun is something i define as having a number of ways to approach and solve a problem, think the way you like to think and still be able to be effective, etc etc. I also have a 1-2 page outline, and since i never did such a complex project come to think of it, i would probably change a few things here and there even after the start, but as little as possible. I hope i dont sound too naive or ambitious :) but i try to learn quickly and if i'm wrong a adjust as soon as i get a hint of how wrong i could be! Thanks for wishing me good luck, i hope i'll have some. Who knows, maybe lots of things don't work out which cause me to change course, such as not having another coder at my side or realising blitz isn't good for something so i have to add it myself (hope that doesnt happen).<br>Also, as i have said, (if you were referring to me) i'll make at least 1 or 2 or maybe 3 smaller games to get a realistic picture. Now all i have is simulations in my head of what would need to be done to get a game of certain complexity and quality, but life has taught me to add about 50% more to the "time required" calculations as something always crops out.<br><br><br>The Dude, youre THE dude, dude! :) I like doing the same thing and of course you dont write on paper things like "when missle locks: make sound of drawn sabre" lol. I would do that as i went along and wrote notes as i thuoght of them. Creative moments come when you least expect them, but the logic of the gameplay is something that can be prepared beforehand.

Kojima secretly wants to make movies.  He's a movie director trapped in a game designers body.  The MGS games are fun, but they are at least 50-60% cut scenes (and they aren't even -good- cut scenes.  Just heads talking on the intercom system).  This was particularly evident in MGS2 where Raiden spent half the game arguing with his girlfriend while the design of the levels themselves really took a creative hit.<br><br>I'd wager that 400 page design doc is 300 pages of dialogue with the last 100 dedicated to the gameplay itself.<br><br>This is not a knock against the man ... I mean, go with your passion ... but I don't think he's in it for the game itself these days.  He's in it for the story telling.<br><br>This is evident in MGS.  While it has a wonderfully rich back story, it's also one of the most convoluted and confusing stories you'll ever read.  It gives most players a headache trying to keep all the names and places and alliances straight.

Not the intercom moments(That's more to immerse you in your world I think) but the actual 'cinematic' moments..like for example when the game starts...snake running across the bridge, engaging his camo and jumping down onto the passing boat termintor style..amazing..or the end of the tanker when  ocelot takes out the ceo and gives his little speech..<br><br>Another great moment when emily dies and they tool up for revenge and walk into the camera..The kinda things you'd expect from QT, not a game.<br><br>But he has said he wanted to do movies before games, many times.

I first started programming in a MSX microcomputer and in a Spectrum+2. When i started programming PC, i started with Turbo C++ from Borland and i found it very cool for the stuff i was mading. But, when Windows95 was released, even if some programmers (like me) don't like it, we had no choice and had to cross to this buggy-platform because of DirectX... Before DirectX and W95, you had to code for EVERY 3D standard and audio standard independently. DirectX was good news, but that was all! Because programming in Windows environment is like a nightmare if you want to do something that is not a window oriented aplication! Even using DirectX, In Visual C, you have to code up to 200 (or more) lines of code to ONLY declare your aplication, create a main window and engage Direct3D or DirectDraw. Ok, most of this work is done by the "wizards" included in VC (it's an automatic code generator) but, hey! an environment who must be programmed this way, IS A NIGHTMARE! That's why the programmers who were coding in free-time and for fun have been disapearing... Now, programing a game it's not fun... NOT FUN AT ALL in Visual C, you know? when you pass the most of the time trying to understand WHY windows do this kind of strange bugs, or trying to understand WHAT THE HELL were thinking about the coders who did Direct3D to make a thing SO HARD to code, in this way, you don't have much time to do what you REALLY wanted to did when you sat in front of your computer.<br><br>Why i'm saying all of this? I just want to explain the REAL situation of coders in this times and how the big companys manage to code the big games of the market.<br><br>Being so hard to code a game in windows environment, the companys have made sub-levels in the market of game programation. There are a few companys that made 3D engines or even 2D engines (to make strategic games), this companys, like ID software, make the real big deal LICENSING their engines to other companys who want to make games for PC. (but in Playstation it's the same thing, they call it Software Developpers Kit, but this kind of packages are very very far of what we know as SDK in PC world...)<br>This way, the most companys buy a license of the engine(with royalties to pay per copy of game, sometimes) and make a game with it. And what is exactly an engine? it's not only a program who draws something on the screen or plays 3D animations... is a complete 3D package made for designing video-games, usually with a programation lenguage inspired in C...<br>That's it, you can consider Blitz3D like a commercial game engine... ok, a real game engine is ready to make a game right out the box and blitz not. But it's because a game engine is VERY specialised and will not let you make anything else than the kind of things it was designed for.<br>Blitz is specialised too, but only to make EVERY kind of game (or even 3D aplication) you wanted to do.<br><br>So, is Blitz3D limited?<br><br>Yes it is, like every game-engine you will find in the planet. But it's the most flexible game oriented lenguage i've seen so far.<br><br>And, can Blitz3D make BIG games like Doom3?<br><br>It's a nice question... with a nice answer:<br>Yes and no! Blitz, as it comes by default, no. But making DLL with Visual C wich will increase internal functions... this way, yes it is possible.<br>Keep in mind that Blitz is using OpenGL internally, a programming layer between software and hardware, in order to run 3D instructions. In 3D, it goes so fast as DOOM3, because DOOM3 is using Direct3D + OpenGL for drawing to the screen.<br><br>Were comes the difference then?<br><br>There is only 2 things Blitz don't do, and i suppose this is because of the OpenGL version is programmed for:<br>BUMP MAPPING and PIXEL SHADERS<br>The first is to make a texture react to the light like if it were in real 3D.<br>The second is the ability to use the cpu inside your 3D card (the GPU) to make simple but powerfull programming in order to automatize water reflections, collisions, rendering effects, projected shadows...<br>Blitz don't let us access some buffers like the Stencil Buffer, wich is specialy designed to calculate shadow projections.<br><br>But, with Blitz you can do a BIG game or not?!<br><br>With Blitz you can easily do the Half-Life 1 engine (and of course "counter strike"). You can do Quake 2 as well. If you are a good programmer, you can make Quake 3 too, but will be slower because you can't use PixelShaders.<br>And, if you code some DLLs in Visual C, you can implement everything you want! where is the problem?<br><br><br><br>I wrote this because i know there are plenty of "serious" programmers wich think in Blitz as a "toy", but i want to say that, if it is based on OpenGL and it is flexible, it's great!<br><br><br><br>Another thing:<br>You don't have to be 30 people to make a great (really great) game.<br>"Prince of Persia" was made by only one man, Jordan Mechner, and it was the first game in history to use motion capture to make the movements of the character!! (Jordan recorded his litle brother running and jumping in the garden, and then redrawed the movements in the PC!).<br>Prince of Persia was one of the better games of these old days, and one of the better graphically.<br>You may think "times have changed", and i say:<br>NOW YOU HAVE BLITZ3D, JORDAN ONLY HAD A TEXT EDITOR.<br><br>Programming a good game is not a matter of money or graphics/music. It's a matter of creativity and fun.<br><br>A good games is not the most impressive, it's the most fun.<br><br>You are programmers, you don't are 3D designers or music composers, ok. But you have internet and plenty of 3D designers and musicians hoping that, one day, they will made something for a videogame! Find them, they are so interested as you are. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But i would add twists such as minigames inside the big game to for example help certain aspects of your "empire" or whatever you are leading. I am talking more about a gameworld where the player would be happy to see more quantity than quality, even though this formula may be considered wrong. Imagine having 1000s of different planets you can approach with 100s of different buildings you can see there in 3d from a nearly unlimited number of races of civilizations. And when i say more quantity than quality i just mean having DirectX 7 quality graphics with polycount and surfacecount blitz can sustain. For the game i am talking about, let alone a Civilization clone, that would be more than enough. Especially if it is multiplayer capable. Just look at HomeWorld, thats what i mean.

If this source prooves to be doing very well then i might devote all my time to it and nothing to developing, but if it prooves to little i might have to find another fulltime job quite simply. I'm just summing up this thread for me cos it is getting a bit long ;) you dont have to read this. But i have another friend who has free time to develop with me. If things go "idle" enough for me i might see that big project through. As I concluded but noone agreed so far, for a turnbased strategy game with many mini-games that i'm planning to make you dont need exactly Dx9 shagadelic graphics, so Blitz itself will do just great. I've been persistant before in many things so i also believe i would be able to finish this thing if i started it. <br><br>Now that was just me, and my personal situation, also trying to explain the reason of this whole (now very long) thread. This outlook was also shaped by many of your opinions :) so thanks, i have some confidence now. Or shouldn't i?<br><br>Oh i didnt mention i can do sound as well, i play guitar piano and sing so there you go. I also worked a lot with my brother who likes electronica we made some sounds so i would know how to make sound effects, though i do not have a studio :( thats the only potential problem for me but nothing a small investment wouldn't sort out.<br><br>Sorry if this is getting to long!! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

And if you spend a while on a project, you will definately get to the "I don't want to do this anymore" point.  Even a short one.  I made a small puzzle game in a month in C with directdraw.  It had music, sound effects, and art all done by myself.  It's nothing to speak of, in fact I don't even think it's very fun, but it's finished.  But even on that 4 months, I got to a point where I just didn't want to look at it.  But then that's the point where you say, Okay, i'm going to work harder now, this is the hump, and i've gotta get over the hump.  That's all there is to it.<br><br>Even something very simple can look like doom 3, if they haven't done it before.  And you're always learning, so if you have to learn something to make it happen in your game, then you do it.  And yes it will take time, that's a given.  So with that in mind, you can make anything you want, just as long as you don't quit.  It could take a short amount of time, or it could take years, it doesn't matter, if you don't stop you'll have something complete, and maybe even fun to play.

If you want to compete with the big guys you need Dx9 shaders etc + super fast assembly routines etc + a huge team. If you wanted to make something to copete with Doom 3 it would take one person more like 10 years. 4 years is a probably a fair estimate with about 3 people. Getting under 2 years would require about 10. Oh, and in those 4 years or so of dev time Doom 3 will be old hat - so your game would need to be made to a level that games will be at in 4 years time. Thats a HUGE undertaking. <br><br>Now, unless your a well known developer, getting a  retail publisher wont happen unless your game is seriously hot, REALLY RED HOT. And, even if you do, you will not make a huge amount of money, most of that $50 goes to shops, marketing, and the publishers pay cheque. Selling a game at $20 will earn you more per sale than you would get at $50 in retail. (not to mention to make a $50 game youd need loads of people, so thats even less that you get into your pocket). So in a 10 man project, you would probably each get 1$ per sale. 2 years of your life, as a programmer of the level you'd need to be at to make this super game would be worth at least $60,000. So you have to make $60,000 sales. Which suprisingly is about the average that most retail games make.<br><br>So you made your money - cool.

Quite doable I think, but you would need a 4 man team with a good talent/skill distribution to pull it off in a 18 month timeframe.

Or in my case, bring the PC to work and do it there in free time as well, since i spend 70% of the time in "idle mode" there, and I've seen many people that work like that too. Those who try make "games" of some sort by themselves just to live off it will hardly have a nice experience. If you just want a paycheck, you go and get SOME sort of exhausting job.

That's also been my aim all along.<br><br>However, I couldn't go from not making a game to making a big game done right (in fact I keep making smaller games to retrace my steps in case you hadn't noticed).  Also, only Market Value and Enigma-X would I consider small games (sometimes those are successful though).  Aerial Antics was a decent undertaking (at first the physics were too buggy and I thought I wouldn't be able to make it work as I wanted ... took a lot of trial and error) and is a fairly big game ... someone called it 'AA'.<br><br>It is a game I dreamed about making since I was about 13 and fell in love with jet packs.  It's not exactly has I planned ... but a game with a jet pack is something I wanted to make since I was 13.<br><br>Anyway, I discovered with True-Vol that I just wasn't ready to make that big game.  I had this idea.  I wanted an online game with power increases where you could see farther, move faster, fly higher, and attack faster ... like Dragon Ball Z.  Then I wanted to go the next step where it was an RPG where players could created their own techniques like players in fighting games etc... who have techniques but in fighting games they're static.  <br><br>In True-Vol I wanted everyone to create their own and then name them.  This way it'd be like Ryu's Dragon Punch ... but it could be like Bandit's Ball Breaker or something ... whatever the player wanted and the button combinations had to be adjustable.  Then I wanted the players to interact with each other on other levels beside combat ... they had to be able to learn each other's techniques, and you had to know who created a technique so your name was attached to it.  Heck, you might get a really powerful technique and be amazed and wonder who originally created it only to wind up in combat with them a month later after the technique had be traded thousands of times.  <br><br>Then I wanted to have common enemies which could be cooperatively beaten which added clue/puzzle elements and rewards to break up the monontony of just deathmatching each other.  The bosses were not unlike things in Zelda where you had a clue and had to figure out how to use the environment to beat them.  For example in one level there's lava in a room.  The clue is "cook roaster" or something ... so if you lead him into the room with the lava his shield goes down and you can blast him ... players did this coop and if they did it fast enough then they'd get extra experience points and unlock new levels.  <br><br>Then I added the armor system (hats and sunglasses are armor)  If you tag someone on the body or guns it's more damage.  Not only were the hats and sunglasses kinda humourous but they were relevant to gameplay ... everything was.  You could create a freeze technique and then fire it at a common enemy or anyone over the lava and freeze them which would drop them into the lava if they were over it and they'd take damage while under the ice was melting.  <br><br>The amount of detail that's in there ... can't really be described ... mainly because it pisses me off that not a lot of people understand it ... the game is truly deep and even when I had 30 people playing it (had a little group of my younger brother's friends who'd im eachother to play after school) only a few kids really understood what the game was about.<br><br>Anyway, learn however you must ... maybe you can make the jump from no games to a big great one on your own ... if reading about my experiences can help you make the jump to that big game without having to screwup first for yourself ... then great ... MAYBE my messup helped someone.  The game did get me noticed ... so it's not all bad.  Garage Games saw True-Vol and commended me on the effort although they blasted me on the presentation.  When I came back a month later with the AA prototype I was actually afraid to open the email.  However, I did and they liked it so I was happy.<br><br>Truth be known I have plans for games ranging from tiny to huge ... all of them have some form of prototype and I'll get to all of them in due time.<br><br>Oh and about work and money and lawyers yada yada.<br><br>I can make more money with my own business doing hardwood floors than just about any position in the game industry.  It's not about money.  I'm making nearly 2 grand this weekend busting my ass as hard as possible (10 hours of blood, sweat, and tears today and my hands are still buring as I type this) just so I can live for another week to work on games (and pay for the house).  My friends last night were pretty much amazed at the amount of money you can make in that business ... and were like oh we're all about money ... we hate our jobs too but we'll do almost anything for money.  Luckily they didn't prod me too much about why I want to make games so bad (they know me) even though I can make more money at the moment doing the floors.  <br><br>I could literally become a millionaire doing floors (I know a few people who are), but at what REAL cost?  <br><br>Money isn't an end.  I work hard for money so that I can have more time to work hard at hopefully making a hit game ... I'd really like to be able to live off my games though so I don't have to break my back forever or listen to anyone besides a paying customer (floors great, if it's for games even better).  I wouldn't even want to work for most game companies ... it'd have to be a really special one ;)<br><br>This is just a huge rant because I'm dead tired and I use forums as a diary ... but you know what's funny?  When I was a kid there were only 3 things I said I wanted to become (you know how people are like I want to be a Fireman when I grow up) and I said all these before age 10.  I wanted to be a professional tennis player, a carpenter, and a game designer.  I just realized that they were all coming true last week when I went to the US Open and said if I ever make it with these games I'm going to train for however many years it takes me to play in the US Open.  When I thought it I realized ... my childhood thoughts of what I would be when I grew up had actually manifested ... well mostly.  I still need to become a very successful game designer and then train for a few years to try and be a competitive tennis player...<br><br>OK, that's done ... time to crash ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Certainy not something to smirk at and make fun of and even in its rather broken state there are some cool things to look at. at the end of the day it suffered from trying to jump the technology immediately avaliable to blitz, and therefor requiring 2-3 different types of collisions, ants own, blitz, and towards the end tocomaks too, naturally this made it a bit of a nightmare to work with in multiplayer. but for just driving around and shooting at another non AI vehicle who's physics reacts to location based hits, and concussion from explosions, neat controls, variety of weapons, pickups and cool sound tied inot the physics engine. He did a lot of good work.<br><br>I think at the end of the day thats what was so frustrating about the whole thing, it really was leaning towards being something that could compete with a AAA game, if only the MP worked, and there was gameplay and reliable intervehicle collisions. <br><br>Probably an extra month for him, and maybe 3 for me to produced 4 more larger poliched levels.

At that time your whole concept was still going to be a FPS with vehicles (some sort of little robots coming out etc..) and not the hover vehicle combat game that it turned into.  You hadn't produced jack squat when I had something up and running to toy with what the game would be like.  <br><br>I knew that you wouldn't be able to produce the game and that you'd only be good at contributing some tech to a project which is why I insisted on having control of the main structure or I was out because there was no need to waste my time.  Now nearly a year later ... guess what I was right.  You didn't have the ability to produce the game and you're still toiling with technology ... completely failing to understand the importance of a good producer who can actually hold a project together and sell it.  <br><br>I did say go ahead without me but that doesn't mean I didn't produce the very first prototype of the concept with the hammer.  The demo I produced was 2 player split screen with different weapons and I know Adrian at least had it ... I thought you both did.<br><br>It is my business too.  First of all you were attempting to work with my partner in Leadfoot Productions which was always going to lead to us conflicting at some point.  You try to move in and work with someone's teammate and that's just asking for problems.<br><br><div class="quote"> <br>I'm don't need no pep talk.( From a lady....;p) <br> <br></div><br><br>You know, I actually work my own business and part of my work is carrying around 200lb machines.

Everything IN GAME is either my idea(Controls/hud system) or ad's idea(Weapon systems).<br><br>Secondly, the controls are nothing like halo's. Halo is a point and go system, in fmc you simply steer, there's no absolute turns like halo. Not to mention the cursor system which is differant also.<br><br><div class="quote"> <br>I did say go ahead without me <br> <br></div><br><br>Again you rewriting history...why? You're making out like you quit on the grounds I was coding or something along those lines.<br><br>What really happened of course is I QUIT, completely. I even sent ad an e-mail saying he could use the code I already did, as I didn't want to cause any trouble.<br>Then, ad got back to me saying he'd rather do the game with me.  So, you had no choice but to leave. You were fired to be blunt. I take no pleasure in that..In fact I even spoke to ad a few times about getting you back on board mid-project, but for whatever reason(who knows, ask ad) it never happened.<br><br>Anyway, let's just leave it in the past man. I mean tell me what's wiser...wasting time argueing over dead projects or spending that time coding/talking about new developements.
