This is often the quickest approach, but is less robust. For example if you then have another box that needs to move in a similar way you will have to hard code that etc.<br><br>My example above is somewhat of a very small example, really you would interlace your program with reusable functions as you can do the same thing over and over on different objects without having to reprogram anything. This has obvious benefits of reducing your coding overall, but you have to really have some experience with writing more robust code.<br><br>If you then take that to its extreme, you can make yourself a reusable engine (or large collection of types and functions that all are already setup to work with each-other) for a certain genre of game. For example, if your making a fps, you could make a massive 'engine' that is designed for you to just slot in different content and tweak some values and you have a new game from it!<br><br>Making an 'engine' has obvious benefits more to large companies, for example, the Source engine by valve can be used again and again by lots of different companies at a fee. If valve had just made 'half life' then they would miss out on that opportunity. If your making pong, then a pong engine isn't that needed.<br><br>Now wether or not you should take this approach is up to you and dependent on the type of game your making. Given that it looks like you have just started, just worry about making a game not an engine.<br><br>An interesting article on it here: <a href="http://scientificninja.com/advice/write-games-not-engines" target="_blank">http://scientificninja.com/advice/write-games-not-engines</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Each game you make will have a different one (different as in built from scratch, even if it uses similar code\logic from previous ones, like if it's the same genre - you can use previous stuff).<br><br>That way you can create a more customized engine for each game you make, and be able to take a more artistical approach to it. Making a universal engine means you'd have to have the same conditions from one world to another, and besides having to be data-based, you wouldn't have so much freedom as you would if you had built an adapted engine from start (well you could make it VERY universal but that would take an incredible amount of time and knowledge of the subject).<br><br>I think re-writing stuff from scratch is the best way. You'll end up having a library of procedures common to all games (like special effects that are not genre-specific) since every time you write the code you naturally end up finding out which procedures get repeated each time you get a game. <br>That can be used to ease up on the time spent developing the overall game. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

After identifying what type of game engine you want to build I would start with an ENTITY system - think of ALL the things you may ever need to do or know about any ENTITY in your game, and write handy routines to take all the complexity of writing the game out. You can set collisions, colours, rotations, positions, scale, textures, anything you need.<br><br>For example in a game I finished early this year, I had to have some collectible objects, these all needed specific properties so I created an INCLUDE file to handle them as follows:<br><br>;gameentity(meshfile$,gescale#,gex#,gey#,gez#,gepitch#,geyaw#,geroll#,gerotation# -2 ,glow,geshadow(True/False) ,shadow size1,shadow size2,shadow size3,distance# of shadow under entity, geparticle=0, gravity=0, trigger, timer,collectable+score))<br><br>The code to call a game entity would be :<br><pre class=code>
gameentity("fish001.b3d",0.15,7624,-910,-7950,  0,0,0,      -2,     1,False,0,0,0,0,   0, 0,0,0,10)
</pre><br><br>I could now instantly load any model, position it, scale it, give it a rotation flag (in order to rotate constantly in my game loop), give it a shadow (by linking into another area of my code to add a shadow type here), give it gravity, set up a particle type, set if it was a trigger or not, and if it was collectable give it a score too.<br><br>Now you could get even clever as with a 'world/level editor' working through a GUI, most of this kind of stuff gets hidden for the user and you just load the object in from a file menu and the actions you do in the level editor sets the objects' properties.  This way a world editor can save you a lot of time, as you plan and set stuff up visually.<br><br>Your game engine reads the files your game editor saves and reproduces what you set up visually, for the in game level/world etc, with all the bells and whistles working for you immediately.  Preparation takes longer, but level building is incrementally faster, and the more levels the better the time saver this would be.<br><br>I hope this helps some.<br><br>IPete2. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

However, in making your 'engine' generic or accessable/"moddable" you will need to do a lot more work and include a lot more non-specific functinality.<br><br>For example, you may be coding a FPS style game with specific weapon types, though these weapons all utilise a basic cosde structure for firing:<br><br>(example pseuddocode)<br><pre class=code>
Gun=GetCurrentGun()
Dir=GetDirectionFacing(X,Y,Z)
DoGunfire(Gun,XYZ)
</pre><br><br>In a specific code structured 'engine' for a single specific game, you may restrict DoGunfire, knowing that all your weapon will act in a certain way:<br><br><pre class=code>
function DoGunfire(Gun, XYZ)

   if (Ammo(Gun)&gt;0)

       Hit=Check 1stTarget(XYZ)
       if (Hit=ValidTarget())

function DoGunfire(Gun, XYZ)

   select (GunType)

   case GUN_TYPE_BALLISTIC
       Hit=Check 1stTarget(XYZ)

In my definition of a game engine the ability to load multiple levels without to run multiple EXEs is very significant.<br><br>Not every EXE with multiple levels is a game engine. Especially beginners write games with multiple levels this way:<br><br><br>Repeat <br>...<br>Until level 1 complete<br><br>Repeat<br>...<br>Until Level 2 complete<br><br>Repeat<br>...<br>Until Level 3 complete<br><br>But infact this way people write a game for every level. Although this gives you ultimate flexibility, it's also a lot of work.<br><br>In a true game engine you are writing the game parts only once and then reuse it with various scenarios for every level. A game engine also contains level editors, or at least a documented level file structure.<br><br>Things like doors, codelocks or puzzles are things you don't want to program again and again. It's much easier to tell the level editor "add a codelock to this door, password so and so".<br><br>So the use of a level file makes a game engine. For example there are mesh file paths, position, rotation, scale data of them, including command codes for special functions (eg. to make something an interactive door etc.) and other parameters that could be used with the object. But not only meshes are defined this way. Positioning 3D sounds is about the same. Usually for a sound there is a dummy mesh displayed in the editor, that allows to position the sound visually, be it wind, water etc.<br>NPCs are a further important part. Whether they use a simple algorythm by following some predefined ways, or they use sophisticated AI and path finding algos, that's rather a question of complexity and available time and programming skills.<br><br>Today commercial FPS game engines became extremly complex, it's almost impossible for one man to write something like the latest Doom/Quake or Unreal engines. But even a simple, small FPS engine that is useing DX7, like Blitz3D does, can be fun. <br><br>In the real world you'll find a lot of game engine projects (besides the big ones). Don't be too impressed by lists of tech features as long as there ain't no playable (and I really mean PLAYABLE, not only a walktrough thing) Demo around - most projects are only 50% or less finished/ready.<br><br>As far as I know all popular FPS games used a game engine. But the level designers still need to be very creative and use a game engines possibilities to (and often beyond) it's limits. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

For example the codebase for a FPS game would be mostly useless and require a HUGE amount of modification to change in order to produce say, a space-sim. <br>However...<br><br>considering the elements and functions contained withion your FPS game, syuch as, say vehicles and more basic operations for the HUD, Front-End, methods of Data-storage/Saved Games etc. etc. Can all still be universally applied.<br>Personally, I tend to  write things in a modular approach with separate functions and wrappers for functions for almost everything. Sure, it probably takes ten times longer, but  I can access the iseful bits anytime from anywhere and steal them for other projects as and when necessary. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
