I worked on graphics engines in Visual Basic before( one WinAPI and one Direct X 7 stuff).  I took C++ last year and i'm taking Assembly this year.  So programming isn't new to me.  I already learned alot from the Blitz3d demo.  But i do have a few questions and i posted in here instead of beginners because i figured i'll get more hits and experters answers.        <br><br>Poly pushing:  I noticed that on my ATI 8500 i get about 700,000 poly per sec...on my friends ATI 9600 XT, he gets about the same rate and there's nothing special goin on in the background.  Just alil camera movement and that's about it.  I was wondering if i'm goin to have to create my own DLLs and run them through blitz3d to try to get some more polys drawing.  My goal is at least 1.5 million polygons a sec.  I would really like 2 or 3 million tho.  <br>Any suggestions on how to get a higher rate?  Have u gotten that high yourself?<br><br>Is it possible to change arrays size in a field(type)? And can u have a Type in a Type(haven't tested it yet,so might as well ask)?<br><br>What's the prefer editor, modeler, and file type?  can u give a reason please.  <br><br>Light mapping, i had some ideas on how to do it already.  But i seems pretty wild.  Got any links or suggestions on that.  <br><br>Alil on what's goin on with me.  Well, i've been wanting to make a game for a few years now and i started talking to a few talented friends of mine and we decided to group up and make something called TK(temp name...means Tank Killas. haha, inside joke).  So we were goin to make a 2d game, but i didn't like the limits that are caused by a lack of a dimension.  So i drove into Direct X 7 (which is what blitz3d is running on right?  Seems like it's using all the structure) to make a faster 2d engine, but 3d still intrigued me.  So i started reseaching DX 8(which has a complete different structure than Direct X 7 and no natural 2d support:( ) and i noticed that VB wasn't goin to run anything at any type of decent speed from the source i Downloaded.<br><br>Then i found blitz and after a day of using it, i showed the team what i could do all ready and they got pumped up.<br><br>The Deal is, i want to make an engine and editor odds are and i know it's goin to take some time.  I plan on working on this project for at least 9 months (engine taking several months of that time range).  I was a bit sad to see that i was only gettin about 700,000 polys a sec and i play todays games that have my card pushing about [15-20],000,000 polys at least.  So my goal is to get about 1.5 million if not higher.   <br><br>Thanks for any help. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I ask this because surfaces slow down Blitz3D much much more than number of polygons. I've personally never needed to get that many polygons but check out the my engine thread by halo. He discusses different techniques to really push blitz3D. The thread can be found here: <a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=37808." target="_blank">http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=37808.</a> <br><br>For arrays, you can resize arrays outside of types but the arrays in types are what are called BlitzArrays and those cannot be resized. <br><br>You can have a type in a type like this<br><pre class=code>
type Apple
   field size
   filed tastyness
end type

type Fruit
   field Amount
   field Apple.apple
end type
</pre><br><br>but you cannot have a type definition in a type<br><pre class=code>
type Fruit
   field Amount
   type Apple
      field size
      filed tastyness 
   end type
end type
</pre><br><br>not that i know why you would want to do that, but it is something you can do in C++ but not in BB3D.<br><br>Umm in terms of Editor; it really depends on what kind of game you're making, you could make your own, though of course that takes alot of time. The best for indoor FPSs (in my oppinion) is CartographyShop you can buy it from <a href="http://cartographyshop.thegamecreators.com/" target="_blank">http://cartographyshop.thegamecreators.com/</a> . For modler i've no idea, if you have the budget then 3DS Mex or Maya would seem ideal otherwise try milkshape 3D, anim8or, Blender there isnt really any best, just whichever you're most comfortable with. For lightmapping, there is an open source lightmapper in the code archives. It's called HAL but atm i cant find it to give you the link. Blitz3D is very fast so i dont see why you wouldnt be able to make your game with it, whatever it is.<br><br>[edit]<br>cartography shop also includes its own very nice lightmapper<br><br>you could also try out maplet which is free when you buy Blitz3D<br>[/edit] <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

After looking at what we think blitz3d can do and looking at our time(school) we are goin to make a mesh-ish game.  I wanted to take advanage of the terrain system(that i'm about 2 steps away from not using.  I want to have a cam range of 10,000 pretty much.  More would be nice, but i'll be real.  The terrain looks pretty good at about 4000-6000 poly detail.  But i strench so hard that when it's morfing, it flips out pretty hard at times (flat to say a small rock size land change).  Then u can see the rim of the terrain flip out a bit on where the water meets it.  I'll try other things tho. <br><br>Right now, we use Anim8or.  I'm really more concern with learning while doing instead of just doing(engine built for me).  I plan on getting into this fleid if you can't.  Building engines test push you logic to new hights(if u really try to make the producure the best u can and the system cleaver and streamline).  So this isn't so much about getting a game done right now, this is part of the learning experience for me.  I kinda want to make my own High Level Engine (when i get a big enough team of course) in the future.  What's it now, like 100 people...sheesh)<br><br>Yea, i don't like maplet to much from what i experienced.  But it does have a nice light mapper...but i want to learn how it works...then make it better maybe :-D. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's best to merge all your high-poly nonmoving meshes.  This is like the Unreal engine's use of staticmeshes.

Even if my engine doesn't reach 6 million, i'm goin to shoot for 2-3 million and if i can make it better, fine.  you guys will probably see me around the forums a bit.
