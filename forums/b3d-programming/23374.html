Heck if you were insane, you could use mine.  There all rigid-body physics thingamajigs. If you use this system, it would allow you to not only do multiple thrust points, but articulated segments and realistic collisions.  Of course you can kludge the systems, as Dr Av says, but it might actually make it easier as you wouldn't have to work with guesswork. As far as translating the result, the current systems simply produce three xy points, one center point, one alligned with the yaxis and one alligned with the z axis. This allows you to place the object at the center point, and aligntovector it to the two other points.  <br><br>  What's especialy cool about the Verlet(apposed to euler's) integration is that with verlet, all you have to do is move one of the verlet points in a direction to impart velocity.<br><br> Of course, as you are sortof beggining blitz, Dr Av's solution might be preferable. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Simulating multiple thrust points MIGHT be realistic... but realisticly something like that would be computer controled to give the illusion of a single point of thrust. (I mean, even the Apollo astronauts didn't have to fire individual thrusters manually, and that was back in the 60s).<br><br>And most spacecraft have a single powerful thruster, and then directional thrusters to turn the craft. Meaning you use turning jets to point your vehical in the currect direction, and then fire your thrusters to move in that direction. Thats how the soyez do it, the apollo craft did it, the space shuttle does it (although the space shuttle does use thrust differential for steering on reentry I believe, but that is because it is in the atmosphere. The dynamics for atmospheric flight are completly different! Also, the space shuttle sucks and is way over-enginered.) Imagine the game physics for the ship in Asteroids, or for the ship in Lunar Lander... that is actually a pretty close approximation on how modern space ships steer!<br><br>I have been playing Orbiter, which is a free and highly realistic space simulator, and even in probably the most realistic space sim out there, and each vehical is calculated as a point (which makes sense for space travel... what does the difference between the weight in the left and right half of your ship compare to the gravitation of jupiter).<br><br>If you want to be REALLY realistic, then you should consider orbital physics anyway (i.e., each ship is orbiting a planet, orbiting a star, etc., etc.). To intercept another ship, you wouldn't turn and thrust for the other ship, you would either thrust in the direction towards or away from your orbit, to lower/raise your orbital energy and have your orbit intersect the orbit of your target.<br><br>As for HOW to simulate vectors without using vector math, is to use a pivot. Lets say you have your ship, and you are thrusting forward in a direction. You point your pivot in that direction, and move it forward for the appropriate amount of time for that frame. Then, lets say the ship is deflected from the side by a beam of energy. You turn your pivot in the direction the beam of energy is traveling, move it based on the value of the vector and your frame time. You do this to the pivot for each vector, and then when all the manipulations are done, you move your object to the location of the pivot.<br><br>Note, this system has problems, so if "realistic" is what you want, you should do the math yourself. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The verlet idea sounds good at the moment. I think (judging by the responses) that I may have put across the wrong idea :-(<br><br>Im actually working on the simulation of a boat type craft in water. But some boats have bow thrusters which can give lateral push to either the front middle or rear of a craft. <br><br>My example of a lunar lander was to try and explain my idea of how things would be more complex than simple centrally rotating masses.<br><br>Anyway, time to get back to it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
