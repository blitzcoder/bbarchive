I still didn't find what I was looking for because my problem is a little more complicated. I'm making a 2D tile-based platformer. I made a level editor dedicated to the development of this game, that creates .lvl files that contain the data for levels. It only contains collision information, but not image tiles. I have the player being controlled with basic 2D verlet integration. The player's x or y velocity can not exceed 4 pixels per frame. Each collision tile on the screen is 32x32 pixels. "player_rx" and "player_ry" are the current room the player is in (it's not relevant to the problem). This is my code to find out if the player has collided with any block:<br><pre class=code>collided = False
For y = 0 To 23
	For x = 0 To 31
		If tile(player_rx,player_ry,player_x/32,player_y/32) = 1 And RectsOverlap(player_x-12,player_y-12,24,24,x*32,y*32,32,32)
			collided = True
		EndIf
	Next
Next</pre><br><br>It sets the var "collided" to false, then parses through all the tiles on the screen, checking whether the tile is occupied by a block and whether the player has collided with them. If it has, it sets collided to true, and that's that - it's colliding. So, what's been driving me crazy that past few days is how to perform the collision response. I got really close once, by moving the player by it's x and y velocities, then (if there's a collision), inch the player towards it old x and y position until there's no collision anymore. But, that always ended up freezing up when one of the player's velocities was 0 because it got stuck in an infinite repeat loop. Can anyone help me out with this? (Let me know if I'm not supplying enough info.) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The player should likely be a centre verlet that is influenced by "feeler" verlets.<br><br>Since verlet uses its last position to determine velocity it should be somewhat workable but you may have to dampen the response slightly (add friction) so it doesnt fly around.<br><br>not sure that helps you. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
