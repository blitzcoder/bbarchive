My original intentions where to produce my own games and make a travelling Virtual Reality gaming theatre and strive to get rich. After wasting several thousands on expsensive laptops, all of which now have fried graphics cards, and a couple of thousand more on Virtual reality headsets I realised that my dreams had turned into poo. It wasn't that I hadn't conquerd the technicalities it was because I ran out of monSoey and couldn't afford a car.<br>So what I am left with is Games design engine created soley in Blitz3D with which first person shooter adventures can be created without typing a single line of code. <br>In my design efforts I have attempted to exploit all the fantastic features of Blitz3D language and I believe that I have.<br>So why am I making this forum post?<br>Simple, because I would rather share my work with Blitz3D programmers than see another of my personal projects vanish into the digital void.  <br>For this reason alone I a declaring my source as an open source project and am going to make it available via my skydrive. <br>I am requesting the assistance of all Blitz3D programmers who would like to freely contribute to the finalisation of this project before offering it as a marketable product to Mark Silby himself<br>as a product to sell as a value added reseller.  I truly believe the endorsement of the company with which a product has been built would rapidly promote it's usage and sale. <br>However, although willing to share what I have already coded I would only be willing to share any profits made from this product on the basis of I get 50% and I devide the other 50% between further contributors by my own judgement of the usefullness of their contributions.<br>I don't just require coders, I also require modellers, Sprite Designers, Sound Effects Designers, Musicians, Character Designers Animators, 3D4GL Games Creators, 3D4GL Games Testers and then after singleplayer mode is finalised I'm going to need networking specialists networking games testing groups.  Marketing specialists, etc, etc, etc.<br> <br>I realise that many of the Blitz3D community may assume that I'm some kind of daydreaming egomaniac attempting to take over the World and suffering from dellusions of grandeur. <br>In answer to these assumptions may I please explain my current predicament: <br>I am presently 52 years of age, I am qualified with a 2:2 Degree in Computer Science with Games Development Which I sat at the University of Hull between 2007 and 2010. I have been pushed into unpaid work for one month since monday this week where I spend my time a receptionist/helper of computer illiterate Job Seekers forced into applying for work via Universal Job Match whilst also applying for work myself on a daily basis under the threat of having my benefits sanctioned.<br>All of the above information is true. I have had no intention of breaking any of the rules of the forum. <br>I offer the source code of my project only to coders willing to contribute for free until profit is generated. I offer the executables to non~coders with which to contribute or not for free.  <br>I'm living on the bones of my bum and hoping that this proposition generates some interest because I'd like to make some income and fill my fridge with food and beer. <br>So please talk to me? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You might be that, too.  But why leave it til now?  Why not do this on day one of unemployment?<br><br>You have a multitude of problems here.  First, Blitz3D is 14 years old, and there are countless better options available now.  That fact alone restricts your potential market to just a handful of people.  Second, not one so-called "community project" orchestrated within these forums has ever been successful.  Not one.  Ever.  If you think you can turn the tide, then good luck, but I can nigh on guarantee that you won't.  Third, the life cycle of 32-bit apps is coming to an end - and that time may well have passed by the time this gets finished.  And on the subject of it getting finished - anybody who takes up this offer is likely not going to contribute a lot, and will only join in to fulfil their need to feel a part of something.  The do-ers here, are already doing their own thing.<br><br>Your best course of action right now, is to show everyone what you've got so far.  Whether you take any more steps beyond that, is really down to the feedback you get.<br><br>And, not wanting to get into a political debate here, but Cameron's forced labour scheme sucks.  If there's work to be done, people should be paid properly to do it - because forcing people to work 35 hours a week for their benefits, means they get a lower hourly rate than the national minimum wage, which is breaking the law.  But all of that is for discussion elsewhere. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I know there are great games engines out there but are there any that require no scripting or programming at all?  I built it this way  initially to give youngsters the chance to mess about with painting in 3D. When I started I had only wireframe non graphics card level knowledge of 3D so building the project taught me blitz3D.  I guess my major problem is quite simply a lack of animated models that I can redistribute. During development I used the Dark Matter collection but obviously I cant give them away. But models can be made within the package itself but it aint easy. about the best Ive done so far is a four winged flapping butterfly. <br>After scouring the net for free animated character models, the results of which are virtually zero Im kinda stummped as to how to make a release of any kind. hence the above post.<br>So ok. you all seem to think a project such as this will flop.<br>Then how can I get any of you interested? Im open to suggestions. I doubt Ill ever make a bean from it now so maybe I should just cutnpaste all the code here and wait for your  well regarded oppinions? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
