If you really want to do it from max this is how I do it.<br><br>1. Do a Complete Map Render To Texture<br>2. Go through each object one by one and save the UVW coords from the new modifier it adds.<br>3. Add a Unwrap UVW modifier to each of the objects and load the relevant UVW coords u just saved.<br>4. Load each texture in the material editor and apply to the relevant object(s).<br>5. Export<br><br>Like I said, its a pain in the arse and IMO not worth the hassle when LightBulb does such a good job and exports straight to b3d. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The lightmapping in both seems excellent (nothing much to choose I believe).<br><br>CShop however, used in conjuntion with the Singularity Engine (just released as open source by Halo - see Blitz home page lower down the news now), means you have a really, really STRONG, and rapid level making capability.<br><br>In CShop you build your level (using primitives I haven;t been able to import any objects as of yet), add classname objects such as particle emitters, portals, ambientsounds, lights, playerstart positions, shaders (like water) and save in the csm format.  Singularity loads the csm format and recognises then places all these special classes into your level based on parameters you set in CShop.  It makes level design rapid and full featured.<br><br>I have Singularity and CShop open and bounce between the two to see what the level looks like, with particle effects, ambientsounds, wavy textures, already in place! That is not to mention the player controls, physics, soundfx and field target capabilities in there!   :)<br><br>This aspect makes CShop a very useful tool. <br><br>Quill 3D also allows you to roam the 3D scene inside the package where you can vioew the lightmapping and your level so far, and I know there is a very efficient portal capability (I have never tried it but I have seen it - it comes with the package).<br><br>I would say have both if you can, otherwise you need to prioritse the features that YOU NEED. <br><br>Both are keenly priced. Quill has many more features for actual modelling whereas Singularity makes CShop extra special for 'breathing' dynaimc life to your levels with little fuss.<br><br>I should say that both do occaisionally crash on my machine, but that may be down to a dodgy sound driver currently causing a few problems!?!<br><br><br>I hope this helps.<br><br>regards,<br><br>IPete2. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
