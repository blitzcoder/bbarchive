I find DBP faster, others find Blitz faster (remember that the 3D engine has been completely rewritten since release).<br><br>Pixel / Vertex shaders are complicated to add full support for, because they require very low level 3D data access (to the world / transform matrices for example).  With next gen shaders (HLSL / DX9) it gets even worse.  Plus you need to cater for cards that don't support a given version of shader.<br><br>Blitz would need a whole host of low-level commands besides the shader ones.<br><br>I would think it unlikely that shaders will get added to B3D, although they probably will be in BMAX.<br><br>It isn't a matter of picking up a shader and plonking it into the code either - if you wanted to write your own you need a good understanding of assembly (and C for HLSL shaders)<br><br>To be honest, the cube mapped water is probably your best option - Unreal II uses it! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
