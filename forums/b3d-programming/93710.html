I have a B3D program which appears to have become so complex that loadfont will no longer work. It globally loads a range of fonts, which are then picked in the program and its subfunctions.<br><br>The parts of code which are not working aren't new pieces of code, they havent changed in quite a while. They were working up untill about 30 minutes ago but now it will error with "font does not exist". The font does exist i've verified that! I've also made a small test program consisting of:<br><br>fnt1=LoadFont("Arial",24)<br>SetFont fnt1<br>Print "Hello you cruel world!"<br>Delay 2000<br><br>Which works!<br><br>So it really seems that the program has just become too complex for LOADFONT() commands. My question is, has anyone else had this error or experienced something similar, and if so, how did you get round it? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

He didn't actually say LoadFont was the culprit.  The error sounds like SetFont barfing at a variable that wasn't set to a font yet.  So his error was here:<br><br><div class="quote"> <br>The parts of code which are not working aren't new pieces of code, they havent changed in quite a while. <br> <br></div><br><br>Clearly they had just changed, but he had forgotten.  Oh, well. <br><br>Regarding IDeal, I notice that the default IDE often fails to highlight the error, and doesnt have line numbers or any other indication of where the error was.  When IDeal is used it just throws a mav for runtime errors unless debug compile mode is used, in which case it opens the default ide anyway.<br><br>IDeal shines when it comes to compile time errors.  It tells you the error, displays the line number, highlights it, and smacks your peepee.  Well, three of those four. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

C++, Java and C# are very powerful languages (that you can get paid a lot to know) but they involve a lot more researching the vast oceans of other add-ons built around them, for everything you need to do.  With Blitz you are working with a standard set of commands.  Large but finite.  <br><br>With C#, say, you have to connect to different kinds of classes for different things you want to do, and each class has its own complexities and documnentation.  When you install .Net, for example, you get over 1G of documentation (that's over one billion bytes).  And that was the earlier version; I don't know about today.  And of course there are huge numbers of third-party add-ons.  <br><br>But of course you only need to look up what you need.  Give it a try... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
