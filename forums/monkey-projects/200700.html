Well the sprite screen wrapping is done. I've add four power ups (additional shield pick up, a limited time shield, rapid fire and smart bomb) the last three are activated as soon as they are collected. <br>The flying saucers are also in there. I've added two types... type 1 just fires missiles in the players general direction. On the other hand, type 2 also fires missiles in the players direction but with a twist as they lock on to the player if they are within a certain range. Both missile types have a limited life time. <br>The type 2 saucer appears at random through out the game but the type 1 only appear in certain levels and there can be up to five saucers in total on screen.<br>There is also title and in game music as well as a music on/off key plus the game can now be paused/resumed (thought the game still continues if the game has lost focus).<br>At the beginning of each new level or after the player has died the player is temporarily invulnerable and the type 2 missiles can't lock on.<br>I've also change the title and the font.<br><br><img src="http://www.dawlane.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/images/game1/asteriodfield-1.png"><br><img src="http://www.dawlane.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/images/game1/asteriodfield-2.png"> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So far all the main features of the game pay are there now.<br><br>The title screens consist:<br><br> Listing the input controls<br> Point scoring<br> List power-ups<br> Hi Score table<br><br>In the game:<br><br> All game objects wrap around the screen this includes showing half the object on one side of the playing area and the other half of the object on the other side.<br><br> The player is invulnerable for 10 seconds at the start of a level or when a player looses a life.<br><br> There can be 2 to 3 asteroids at the start depending on the level.<br> Power-Ups include extra shields,increased player fire rate,a smart bomb and a time extended shield. The last two are activated when picked up.<br><br> The red saucers appears randomly through out the game. But the grey saucer only appears at random times in certain levels.<br> The saucers now start outside the playing area and head to the centre. Once on screen they will wrap around the screen if they leave the playing area.<br><br> When a saucer fires a bullet they now target the players current position and will expire after a certain time has passed. <br><br> Bullets from the red saucer will reacquire the player if they come within range of the player.<br><br> When the red saucer is hit a random power-up maybe dropped. If the player is invulnerable picking up the time extended shield just give the player a additional shield.<br><br> Meteor showers will randomly occur from one of four direction through out the game.<br><br>Hi-scoring consist:<br> The player can enter 10 characters for a name. Once character 10 is entered the name is added to the hi score table. The player can select a character from a table of characters and can use special characters to add a space,rub out a letter and enter the current name to the hi score table.<br><br>The hi score table is then displayed showing the players position within it.<br><br>Things to do:<br> Improve collision detection<br> Implement a way to save the hi score table somewhere.<br> Add code for other platforms iOS,XBox.<br><br>And get round to completing the web site.<br><br><a href="http://www.dawlanesoftware.com/games/flash/asteroidfield/asteroidfield.php" target="_blank">Asteroid Field (Flash)</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
