Really enjoy playing real retro games and modern retro style games. Second, I’m a Christmas nut. One of my most favorite times of the year. <br><br>So... I’ve been working on a retro Christmas game for a bit over 5 weeks now. This is pretty rough at this point but is playable.<br><br><img src="http://garsgames.com/Games/Christmas2015/screenshots/1.png"><br><br>Strange things are going on in the North Pole. Take on the role of Santa Claus. You’ll receive quests taking you out of the village into the other gameplay areas.<br><br><img src="http://garsgames.com/Games/Christmas2015/screenshots/3.png"><br><br>I’m mainly looking for feedback in the following areas at this point:<br><br>1. Difficulty: Is it too easy, too hard or just right?<br><br>2. Is this the kind of game you think of when you are in the mood to play a Christmas game?<br><br>3. Does it feel retro?<br><br><img src="http://garsgames.com/Games/Christmas2015/screenshots/2.png"><br><br>More details if you’re interested…<br><br>The goal was to create a retro Christmas game basically between the NES and Sega Genesis system constraints. This means basically a retroish style presentation and constraints on the overall amount of graphics and animation that can be present at any one time.<br><br>I tried to stick as close to that as possible. Most of the time there are only about 30 colors on the screen. Maximum colors at any one time are about 36 currently. All colors are chosen from a fixed-palette of 128 colors. So it is more than NES 8-bit games and less than the Genesis 16-bit games.<br><br>I wanted to combine elements of action adventures with other games. Basically the main hub (North Pole Village) is where events take place to push the story forward. This main area is where you learn what is going on &amp; receive quests.<br><br>You’ll leave this area entering other gameplay areas to perform the quests. My goal is to have several styles of gameplay ranging from platformers to topdown skiing levels to flying. However, I’ve only had time to knock out a couple platformer stages. It’s a long-term project I knew I wouldn’t complete until next Christmas.<br><br>This is early in development and truly a version 0.1 my first release just to ask for feedback. I was reluctant to throw it out here and almost waited until I had another round of development next year. Because I have a habit of throwing things out so early they really don’t show where I am going with it. I think this one does a better job of it though so I am taking the plunge.<br><br>I know much of it is rough (and incomplete such as reusing gifts in place of parts) and this is because it is version 0.1. ;)<br><br>Please feel free to leave your comments on the game page or here in this thread.<br><br>Thanks for taking your time to check out my game, rate it and leave your feedback on what you like and what can be improved.<br><br>Play <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/garbenjamin/the-adventures-of-santa-claus-version-0-1" target="_blank">The Adventures of Santa Claus</a><br><br><img src="http://garsgames.com/Games/Christmas2015/screenshots/4.png"> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
