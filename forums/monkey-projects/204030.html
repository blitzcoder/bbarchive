As you can see however they are very very dense atm and will need some adjustments to get it working perfectly, I will be playing with those over the coming weeks to get everything perfect and the star systems to proper scale that I can be happy with the end results :D<br><br>This is a Linux build as you can see :)<br><br>EDIT: I have now fixed the backing of the placeholder player ship so its no longer a box :). Also I have the sizing for the sol system, this might not be in the game but gives a good indication of scale for the generator, what I want to do in the end is have the game generate everything procedurally this will make the game more appealing and keep overheads small on the art front. On the whole the asteroid belt will not appear in all systems I do plan of having asteroid fields as well to throw more into the mix these were planned for SF2000 but language problems forced that one out the window.<br><br>Things that are planned are:<br>Realistic sized star systems - dont worry im not doing a frontier that was waaaaaay to boring tbh flying between x and y, shooting at z. I still plan on having the jumpdrive.<br>Hyperspace: I want to keep then FTL drives this time though FTL wont end in the target system it will jump you to hyperspace so you can navigate to your target destination :)<br>BBS-the SF2000 bbs will be completely revamped and added to so everything you do may or may not make news ;)<br>TIME - no not a clock in the corner, I want to game to work out how long you were away from it. Dont worry not for missions etc BUT more for news articles and missions you didnt go on (others doing missions etc).<br>Combat - yeah I already have a code base for this so its got to be refined and tweaked :)<br>Landing - like Starflight (which its based on) you will be able to orbit a planet, land if you desire (and its safe to do so), and release a rover ATV to explore (with limited fuel). Landing will be selecting a interesting location on the planet surface and then actually landing (with thrusters etc).<br>Races - yes the ten races from SF2000 will be in there too this time though they will actually have territories and border wars :)<br>Missions - yup missions will be in from SF2000 along with missing ones like military missions etc :D<br><br>Things that are not planned:<br>3d - this isnt planned as yet as 3d overheads can slow a game to a crawl and the daft light limits cause problems as well.<br><br>All planned and it will be nice to finally get to release the game in its intended state :D<br><br>More soon... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

At first glance this might not sound like much but I do intend on adding multiplayer to the game at some point so everyone having the same universe is very handy.<br><br>Things on my TODO list are:<br>1) NPC - I still have to finalize these I have an idea for these and want to make the AI much more than sf2000s simple AI, this will be done via a fear/panic value so when they are in combat their fear rises till they hit their panic level then they will try to flee. Some races will have no panic and are completely ruthless in combat this will be apparent later on.<br><br>2) weapons - I want to try to implement bolt weapons over sf2000s beam lasers I will run tests on this before commiting to them, if it works it will look better but if not I will beautify the beam lasers anyway.<br><br>3) Space stations - I have the mesh and code done for them I will add them in before the next build the mesh will change as will all of em later on.<br><br>4) extraction - I have a media protection system in development and at the moment its looking good but once complete I will put all media in an encrypted file for decompression and decryption later when loading.

The problems are as follows;<br><br>1) The joypad on tablets/phones - I have redesigned it and now it is scaled dependent on the resolution of the actual system its running on so tablets will have a bigger control pad than a phone BUT the graphics will look relatively similar just phones have less screen space as the screens arent as big. Yes the game is catering for 640x420 and upwards (yes I know this is a odd res but I want to cater for everything possible and still have a playable game :) ).<br><br>Oh and its now on monkey 79e too :)<br>2) A system glitch that would cause the game to intermittently crash, yes I was rather lazy about this one as I didnt want to track it down but the vacation seemed to blow out the cobwebs and I managed to find it and fix it.<br><br>Next up is re-ordering the generation system so it caters for textures first (depending on how many are required) and then generates them whilst we have the hyperspace system going on (like the old sf2000 ah happy days) once that is completed and it works to my liking I will release another demo. Yes atm I am sticking with the Frontier style generator mainly because this is actually what sf2000 was like and jumping to Freelancer maybe a nice idea but its not the same game so there you are. Dont worry though I can use the editor for another space game that is in the pipeline but more about that another time :D.<br><br>Once we have everything in there I can then get another loverly demo out hopefully with screen res switching etc for Desktops and a apk (yes I promised one ages ago) for android devices :D <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Another thing is it has opened up the possibility for me to add in the Hypertunnel that was in SF2000 where between systems you had a loverly colourful tunnel this will be added into the game in the next release :)<br><br>2) Texture generation time has been reduced this is partly down to the reordering but its there<br><br>3) Frontier like systems - I know I wanted to go with the Freelancer style systems but in the end I thought that it wasnt like the original SF2000 game so im going to use the now complete editor for another game as and when it arises. Dont worry Frontier like in size and layout NOT physics or devoid of NPCs :)<br><br>4) Fixed a bug with the camera button - when hyperspacing the camera button was disabled whilst it was waiting to hyperspace this has now been fixed :)<br><br><br>TODO: Well I have loads of things on my todo list and its partly the reason that I changed this topic to a work log so people can comment on its progress, yes its taken ages to get here BUT taking into consideration monkey is a much more different beast than max I am very happy with the end results. For those wondering whats different well you cant just put in a 'Delay( 1 )' and hope your app doesnt crash you have to release your functions after a certain time or the app will crash and be terminated on mobile, this was what killed SR early on as the generator was taking about 15-20 seconds to generate so Android killed it. Well back to the todo things that are needed are:<br><br>1) Hypertunnel - I cant wait for this :)<br>2) Space stations - these are next on my list<br>3) NPCs - need finalising for generation etc<br>4) Main menu and title graphics<br>5) Icons<br>6) Galaxy map - yes its gonna be BIG<br>7) Models and textures for all of the ten initial races (more after release)<br>8) Combat<br>9) Info screens<br>10) BBS system for docking<br>11) Docking - always helpful<br>12) Networking - this may be after the initial but has ALWAYS been planned for the game (hence the requirement to reduce the generation times etc)<br><br>So yeah there are loads of things to sort and then I can release a early WIP demo for android as well as soon as I done the early tests and added the hypertunnel :D<br><br>More soon...<br><br>EDIT:Well I have readded space stations to the game as well once again, the whole system also now has bounding checking to make sure planets etc arent inside other things in the system so its more easy to navigate around. After a little adjustment stations are now nearer planets than the moons so should be easy to find for missions etc. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Why I want to create the editor for tablet you may ask and the answer is very simple, I wanted the editor on my tablet mainly because I dont have loads of time to devote to turning on my laptop, setting it up, waiting for x development platform to load, typing, seeing to family stuff. Now with it all on my tablet I can just create and save then upload to my website for use or email it to my account for use :)<br><br>How big will each system, well the test system I made (one sun, a space station, wreck, danger zone, two jumpgates and a tradelane) all come in at a whopping 338 bytes (yes BYTES). So with the size of games these days I should be able to map out quite a universe and still keep it 'downloadable' :)<br><br>On the Star Rogue front I STILL HAVE NOT been able to rectify the freezing dead ships which is annoying as it would have helped no end but I will still use monkey to update my editor and make simple 2d games that I can upload to the internet or GoogleStore :). I would love to complete the whole project using monkey but it seems that minib3d isnt in development atm and I dont have the time to delve into it. If Adam was to fix the freeentity situation and possibly complete the system I would have continued development OR mark releases the 'monkey 3d' module. I could go 2d with Star Rogue I suppose now there is an idea I will look into :)<br><br>Who knows... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

To sort it I had to create all the ships required for a particular system at generation time so they are randomly selected and then they are hidden when not in use.

Before ya gasp in horror the reasons for this are million fold as I will explain:<br><br>1) Star flight the game all this is based upon was top down 2d this is the art direction we are using now.<br><br>2) with 3d using the original system I could have -65535 to 65536 sectors of space on the x,y,z now this is big but some of the bigger systems are off scale and tend to look a little screwy.<br><br>3) system sizes have been increased to -2billion to 2billion on the x and y, if the project does go 3d eventually then it would be z as well.<br><br>4) already just last night I have coded infinite asteroids, nebulae, mine fields and open space areas this lends weight to the new huge system ideal.<br><br>5) flying off the outer edge of the system will now put you in interstellar space (original star flight) where you can navigate to another system or reenter your the last one.<br><br>6) jump gates will now transport you to another system in the game which could be anywhere on the game map, likewise wormholes just transport you to a sector x,y and a offset x,y so you could end up deep in interstellar space.<br><br>7) the galaxy map has changed to be like sf2000's where it was billions of sectors across, there will be predefined systems for each race but there will also be procedurally generated ones for the rest.<br><br>8) we have a system in place so you can build your ship from components so you can make it as fast or as armed as you like it this is also nice as we also want the player to be able to make their own components if they have the blueprints.<br><br>9) The whole project is being coded using monkey, it could have been Unity but monkey is very very lightweight for this sort of project and I don't need overbearing 3d for it at all just paste, move and rotate. I also have EdzUp framework for just this sort of game :)<br><br>As soon as I sort the nebula density I will post a screenshot atm it looks like we hit a really dense cloud :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Imagine a whole galaxy of those now that would be a rather nasty place to be.<br><br>As you can see some of them were a pain to find and some were quite easy but now they are all got rid of I can move into getting NPC's to attack each other and the player this is my next task and one that I will relish to see in action :)<br><br>Edit: I now have the system radius for leaving the system and going intergalactic, now I need to make sure that if a NPC runs beyond this distance they leave the system. All these little things will add extra mechanics to the game, things like attacking a target before they escape the system etc. All of it makes for a interesting game ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Police and hunters work in unison so if there is a pirate in the system you can guarantee that if its a high security system then they will not survive long. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Once I have got back into the swing of things then I can move to getting everything back on track and hopefully updating it all so we can release new content and make the whole thing much more than it is now.<br><br>I also have to pull apart the packing system as there are areas of that which I dont like the look of and to be honest in some cases dont actually work to this end I want to do that section of the game first and then move to adding more and more to it till its where I want it to be for final release on all targets :D. Over the last few days I have been kicking a few bugs but some of the issues seem to be different every compile so these I will be tackling first maybe recoding sections of the system to make sure it doesnt happen again :).<br><br>I would port to MonkeyX2 but at present in my eyes it doesnt look complete enough for me to jump forwards and dive into it, MonkeyX1 maybe a little less functional than X2 but its actually release ready and you dont need any external files (a pet hate of mine) :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Dont get me wrong I would still love to make it so that people didnt steal my media or change a few graphics and call the game their own BUT that can come once I have something worth protecting.<br><br>Now that that is out of the system and I have loads of other things ready to go into the pipeline I want to move on GALACTIC NAVIGATION yes it has to be in caps as this is the biggest part of the universe and something that is actually already in there to a certain degree. You could press the G key in the old demo to create another new random system from a total of four billion different permutations and arrangements. Once you reach the outer limits of a system (set during loading or generation depending on the system) you will leave the system and go galactic. Once your out there your energy levels will start to decrease until you enter a new system where the solar panels will recharge you OR you run out of energy and effectively your character dies a hideous death lost in the intergalactic space between systems never to be seen again (or turns up in a future film about hostile organisms) ;).<br><br>I keep getting asked 'why monkey' quite a lot and I also have posted this answer in other places, the answer is more different than I first thought and here it is:<br>1) MonkeyX allows all targets - yes there is LOADS of faffing around to get it to compile BUT when it does its good to go.<br>2) Retro rendering - MonkeyX has a certain retro feel to it which I am trying to get for Star Rogue. I dont want to make another Elite Dangerous but more like another Starflight.<br>3) MonkeyX2 has higher requirements than MonkeyX1 (mojo1) - this has put me off a little as I dont want to use SDL if I did I would go C++ as SDL compiles for all the majors as well including android (with some faffing around)<br>4) Netbook - yes it works on me netbook so I can still code when I am out visiting relatives :)<br><br>So ya see its quite simple really it works on everything and makes my game look retro :).

In Star Rogue you DO NOT have to have stations that orbit planets/suns you can have them free floating in the universe the system itself will work out how far they are from the primary for star map generation.<br><br>Its all rather technical but once complete I will upload a new piccy of the whole thing in action :D. After this I will add in the whole internal views thing and station view, this view will allow me to code the internal ship view, planet surface view and space station view all will be catered for by this system and mean its easier for players to navigate. On the whole the project is still moving forwards there are going to be some 'adjustments' to the system before the whole game is release Aradis and Akaron will be retired in favour of other names that I have selected (all 150 or so of them) these will make up the background of the Terran sector of space. Of course there will be LOADS of others races out there with their own rich stories and backgrounds after more is in then its going to go to 'war' ;)<br><br>More soon... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

For example Aradis 1 has a moon (Aradis 1a) if you click on Aradis 1 then that would move to the left where the sun is and the things orbiting Aradis 1 would trail to the right so it would show Aradis 1a.<br><br>2) Descriptions and details are not set at present, this will change and allow me to mould the game as time goes on even after v1.0 release.<br><br>3) NOTHING is to scale, this is to make it easier to manage the rendering and scales of everything in the game :D<br><br>4) Its still WIP. Yes I have LOADS still to do on the star map but its looking quite nice as it is, I still have to do the 'mouse click' selector and more information about the relevant items clicked on. There will also be a lock on system so if I select Freeport 1 in the system map and return to the game the locator arrow will point me to Freeport 1 :).<br><br>5) There is plans for a counter to show how many items are in orbit around any given item in the game ;)<br><br>Its still slow going in places but im really happy with the results currently and once I get everything to a playable state I will release another demo :D<br><br>EDIT:<br><img src="http://www.edzup.co.uk/images/SRSystemMap2.png"><br><br>As you can see number five is already in there ;).<br><br>I have also added a new section to Ultim now the text written to the screen can be adjusted to fit a certain sized window, in the image above the description for Freeport 1 is actually one line of text in the game engine but is adjusted by Ultim to fit the screen. On the whole I am very happy with the end results I still have to add the selector for planets etc so we can scroll through the system etc that will be next but on the whole its looking very nice and how I wanted it to be :). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
