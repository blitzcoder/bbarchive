Getting pretty fun. ;)<br><br><b>EDIT:</b><br>On Chrome 37, it ran very very well. Don't think I noticeably got it to drop below 60 fps even with lots of explosions / debris / small roids.

Nice and smooth.<br><br><b>As a side note:</b> I don't know what all you have planned, but a defense turret satellite powerup would be cool--maybe upgradable with further powerups?
