Reach the point-goals in each level to advance.  I like to say it's easy to play, but challenging to master.<br><br>To get an idea of what it's like, I was also told tonight that it is somewhat like Pac Man, had Pac Man been a 2D side-scrolling platform game.  I think I see what they mean :)<br><br>The link is to a page with screenshots, and then to a free lite version available in the Android Market.  I'd love to hear your feedback.  I plan on submitting it to Apple next week.<br><br>EDIT:<br><br>Flash version now available to be played. The game has been submitted to the App Store as well.<br><br>Flash lags a bit, it runs best on Android phones, and Firefox seems to be smoother than Chrome for some reason.<br><br><a href="http://www.selticeapps.com/scorched-monster/" target="_blank">http://www.selticeapps.com/scorched-monster/</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The graphics are just lovely, and everything plays well.  I opted for the full version :)<br><br>I just noticed one very small issue with the tile engine.  When you jump right at the bottom of the screen, lines appear between the tile rows.  I think this can be fixed by not using floats to draw tiles, or to turn off anti aliasing.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br><br>Andrew <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'm so glad you like the graphics too - and thank you especially for trying the full version.<br><br>I'm actually using Nearest pixel when drawing, and do have all anti-aliasing off in mojo and the images are anti-alias free as well. <br><br>Arrrggg, I thought I had this darn problem solved.<br><br>Which Android device are you using, and do you know the screen resolution?  I don't seem to have this problem on our Galaxy Tab 7", and I haven't seen it on a couple family members' devices.<br><br>I wonder if it's just the resolution it's running at.<br><br>Again, thank you so much for trying, I really really really appreciate the feedback. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Just tried version 1.0.2 and the problem is still there sorry.

Well, I really didn't want to go back to this, but I'm going to edit the tiles so they overlap a bit.<br><br>Having a 1-pixel oddity like this in a live product is like nails on a chalk board to me :(<br><br>EDIT: Honestly, it's for the better, it also gets me one step closer to my HTML5 version working.<br><br>EDIT 2: Yup, overlapping is fixing HTML5.  Oh well.  Spent a lot of time trying to get it working the other way only to have to roll back, lol.  All part of the fun.  I remember my original problem being that certain edges weren't lining up correctly when I used overlapping, so hoping that in this game I can avoid that problem even though I'm going back to that method. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
