Ever since that I wanted to make games like that to. The things I make I sometimes are what can be used with a more complete strategy games. <br><br>When I have gotten a good amount of code ready then I will be creating a larger strategy game. For now I am creating smaller parts of a strategy game.<br><br>Below here is a link to a map generator that I learned to make not to long ago. It is not that complex but it can create maps that are useable. <br><a href="http://monkeygameprogramming.blogspot.nl/2015/01/monkey-x-random-terrainland-generator.html" target="_blank"> Flash applet / code - Click here</a><br><br>Here is a post from my blog where I show how to floodfill maps to be able to use that data for the game ai and such. <br><a href="http://monkeygameprogramming.blogspot.nl/2015/02/monkey-x-water-surface-counter-bug-in.html" target="_blank"> Flash applet / code - Click here </a><br><br>Here is a post from my blog with a 2d map with minimap <a href="http://monkeygameprogramming.blogspot.nl/2015/01/monkey-x-minimap-and-map-code-example.html" target="_blank"> Click here </a><br>Here is a post from my blog with a isometric map <a href="http://monkeygameprogramming.blogspot.nl/2015/02/monkey-x-isometric-map-mousetile.html" target="_blank"> Click here </a><br><br>I also already made a a* pathfinding algorithm   <a href="http://monkeygameprogramming.blogspot.nl/2015/01/monkey-x-star-pathfinding-code-example-a.html" target="_blank"> Flash applet / code - Click here </a> that I wil be using. <br><br>With Blitz basic I already made several programs with the settler/engineer/worker ai that uses pathfinding. I still need to make more versions with more features that I need to test. I wil need to add more planning for the worker units. ea Not travel to far and let closeby units handle improvements later on.<br><br>Here a link to the worklog on blitzbasic.com <a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/logs/userlog.php?user=17910&amp;log=1893" target="_blank"> Click here </a><br>Here a link to the worker automation worklog on blitzbasic.com <a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/logs/userlog.php?user=17910&amp;log=1890" target="_blank"> Click here </a><br><br>A number of days ago I decided to invest in my knowledge and bought 4 game ai books. I hope I will learn things from it that wil make my future games better.<br><br>I already found a chapter in one book on how to do the transporting of units. This is something that I need to get a hang of. I wil probably make several smaller programs to get a hang of that.<br><br>I have no idea when I will get a more complete playable game finished. I tried once to get far with a game like that but it just was not fun to play. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I send it to support and they are working to fix it.<br><br>I checked how much room I have on google sites for hosting flash applets and there is 100 mb available. The maximum size of a file is 20mb. So I wil be able to make and host a lot of things with it. Flash applets are pretty small when compiled. About 25 kilobytes for a few hundred lines of code.<br><br>I want to spend more time learning how to code in Monkey before I create larger things. When I started 2 months ago I was still doing procedural things and now I am more and more creating classes and putting code in that. I wil make smaller tbs things to get experience for making a larger tbs game.<br><br>Here is something related to my strategy game that I made recently :<br><a href="http://monkeygameprogramming.blogspot.nl/2015/02/monkey-x-2d-maps-with-shoar-tiles.html" target="_blank"> maps with shores</a><br><br>Its a simple map editor with shore tiles. I do need to learn more about Monkey arrays becourse instead of using a int array I used a string array to store the shore location data. I put a question in the beginners forum and hope I wil learn it soon. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I wil use mutliple dimension arrays for now and if I get into speed trouble then I wil profile with the google chrome html5 profiler. Someone tought me how to do that on google+ (SetColor was a speed problem then) The smaller tests/experiments wil probably show me what the slow parts are. <br><br>The speed problems I think where I really need good solutions for is the amount of units and the ai on larger maps. In civilization 3 I remembered having to wait a lot of minutes for the ai to be finsihed on larger maps. But I have 5 or 6 game ai books that have information in it about optimalization and tricks ect. (still need to spend more time with them :) ) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
