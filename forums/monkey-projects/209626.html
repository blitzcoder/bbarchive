Or move them to the top. The only advantage of a "text value" next to the ship is to keep an eye on it even in hectic situations. In that case a small "5px wide, ship height high"-bar with "steps of 10%" will be faster to recognize as "healthy or unhealthy".<br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Thx for your Ideas.<br><br>@chrome/HTML5: funny thing is, when i build&amp;run from Mokey it works fine here, but when i start the monkeygame.html from the build folder it's same problem over here. But when i start from dropbox, it's working again ... don't know why. <br><br>I just compiled to Android for fun and played on my outdated mobilephone, and it works great there (Android 2.3). Problem: how do i steer the player up/downward? <br>I guess there are at least 4 solutions: 1. Only move horizontally (as it worked fine, but then i need to adjust the enemy-movement and stuff, as it is kinda different gameplay) ;2. kind of a "fixed Cross" on Screen (left or Right bottom - easy to reach with the Thumb; but you might cover a big part from screen with thumb) , 3. when u do a touchHit it stores the first touch and then it moves relativly to the Touchdown X/Y, or 4. if you touch on one side above the ship, it moves up, or under it moves down - but then you need to move the fingers alot so i think it's not the best solution. <br>What would you think is the best solution? Do you prefer any of these, or have an own idea? <br><br>After 'fixing' some Alpha-Blinking Effects it's now worth Sad. <br>The Player-Ship now seems to blink randomly. Is there a "maximum number of SetAlphas" i should know? <br><pre class=code>Method Draw()

   End Method</pre><br>and, with this extra SetAlpha it's jitting a lot more ... <br><br><br>Edit: Damn, found out that it's not an Alpha issue, but a SetColor one from drawing the StatusBar (which was included latest) *shame on me*. <br><br>By the way, is there any satisfying solution to minimize the SetAlphas/SetColors as it seems to slow down the game most? <br>May the game run faster, if i create new PNG's with included alpha values to prevent using SetAlpha/SetColor? But this would mean, I've to draw at least for every "hitable" object a second picture. <br><br>for now I'm doing it like that way: When the enemy gets a hit, i'm drawing a second image with 0.3 Alpha and SetColor to light-grey over the first one, so you can see a slightly 'animation'. <br>On desktop target it's as fast as before, so the setColor/alpha is just a big thing for Flash/Html ? <br><br>latest version 0.7.1 <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/100178309/FranticSpace_0.7.1/MonkeyGame.html" target="_blank">Flash</a> <br><br>Bye Duke <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If it doesn't work on one target, none of them get it. In fact, when Monkey was first released, there was no SetColor operation due to HTML5 not supporting image tinting. Mark had to make a hack that writes the images pixel by pixel. This is why you should avoid SetColor for HTML5. <br></div><br><br>I did not use "SetColor" that much in my jam entry but "SetAlpha" (for "blink"-fading texts).<br>If "SetColor" is really that slow, it might perform better if you have a white "outline" variant of your sprite (just play with "contrast" in your painting program) to make "flash" effects - or a black "outline" variant for some similar effect (- but in that case I would prefer "SetAlpha" only). Of course this does not work well for thousands of particles, as you then have twice the draw calls. In this case you could of course have both sprites on one sprite atlas.<br><br>If you want to measure influence: try to draw 1000 (or so) simple objects with or without SetColor/SetAlpha...<br><br><br>@ opening html directly<br>You miss the "server" behind then... It does "remotely call" for the resources, which does not work for this "localhost"-approach (url: //file/bla/monkeygame.html  instead of <a href="http://192.168.0.1/monkeygame.html)." target="_blank">http://192.168.0.1/monkeygame.html).</a> This is the reason why this "mserver" starts up when doing html5.<br>Of course it should work "without" too...but this is not true for the current monkey revisions. <br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
