The game style seems very straight forward which is good! My only criticism is that everything seemed very rigid and had linear/sharp movements. For example when you pan left and right the camera might look better to follow the ship a bit smoother and independently from the ship. Another example is that all the waves and enemies seem to move in very straight lines and quite robotic-ally. <br><br>That aside it is definitely shaping up well :D <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Red is a color the brain associates with blood and violence, so using it all over the place will stress people out. Maybe consider using a more relaxed color like purple or blue instead? Oh, and less saturation for the bg elements. You don't want the background to compete with game objects for attention. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
