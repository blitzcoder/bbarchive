Over saturated.  Still, I ask myself: could there be room for just one more? <br><br>What if it featured a certain hungry robot mascot named after a certain mobile OS?  One that just being fed, oh I don't know- certain desserts.  <br><br>What should we call it?<br><br>How's about Desserted ?!<br><br>You know, deserted.  deSSerted.  BejewelED.  Get it? Heh-heh!  Okay, it is corny.  Other names like Be-droid or Bee-droid came to mind, but my son likes the name and thought me witty (And *that* makes me feel good inside.)<br><br>While learning to code with Monkey, I decided I would start by creating a Bejeweled type game but with an Android theme.  Gems replaced by its various OS (Cupcake, Donut, Eclair, Froyo, Gingerbread... ...Ice Cream?)<br>and special items such as the Honeycomb Bee and the Market Bag (and ???) are used as powerups to clear sections of the playfield.<br><br>It is all very much WIP, but much of the basics are already functional, enough so that I feel I can post a screen shot without feeling too embarrassed.<br><br>I am the first to admit, it looks dull and much too green.  Future plans are to allow between a choice between two sets of graphic sets.  One of which is solely based on the official or semi-official desert graphics, and a much more colorful alternative.<br><br>Adding a cute/cool factor is Andy interacting somewhat with the game itself.  Such as:<br><br> +After grouping three or more desserts, they fly into his mouth.<br><br> +Andy shakes his head at illegal moves.<br><br> +Gets mad if you take too long to feed him.<br><br> +Taunts.<br><br> +And possible dance moves when you complete a level.<br><br><br>So, that is pretty much it, in a rather large nutshell.  Lots of polish to be done.  I would like to actually sell this if it comes out as good as I hope it can be.  But... I am thinking it might have to be free or ad supported.  Legally, can I even use the Android and the other graphics?  It appears at least from the over abundance of match 3 type games, that I am in safe waters to make another clone, though that could change(?).  It just may not be profitable at all.  <br><br><img src="http://bit.ly/ei0DPC"><br><br>It is really just a learning project for myself, so if it just sits in the Monkeycoder website's Apps section and gets played, well I can be happy with that.<br><br><br><br>Your thoughts?  I am a little nervous, so don't be too hateful. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
