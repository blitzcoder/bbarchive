I put engine in quote marks because it's more of a back-end -- the original SLAY used Lua game files but for SLAY2 games are written in Monkey source and compiled along with the app. Nowhere near complete (there's a fuller version written with PhoneGap so a lot of the busywork is replicating features that HTML5 gives you for free) but you can certainly check out the <a href="http://www.into-games.com/extra/SLAY2Test/" target="_blank">current work in progress build</a> if you're so-inclined :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I also want to avoid another project like BlastOff!, where I spent the vast majority of the development time adding functionality to the detriment of adding content (there's no meta-game in BlastOff! and it probably needed one). Once the engine bit is solid I should be able to concentrate on content without having to trouble myself with it again, particularly as it's a narrative-based form. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
