One note I'd make is that it's kind of unplayable with the mouse at the moment because you're required to keep the mouse pointer on the "bat". Less of an issue with touch but still maybe worth changing so that control works anywhere or at least within a more generous zone. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Works fine on my Win8.<br><br>A few things:<br>* When going back to the main menu from the game the music stops<br>* Level 4 needs work, I tried for 5 mins to get the ball (cube?) thru the path and gave up<br>* Music is not great IMO only :)<br>* When you have the special effects (ice, slime etc) you cant see your bat fully in some spots<br>* The look of the bat (slightly 3d) makes it had to judge the right hand side collisions<br>* Reduce your download by removing the sounds formats that don't work on GLFW <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
