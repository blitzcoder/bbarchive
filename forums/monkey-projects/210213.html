Mouse vs Trackpad.  If I were using a mouse it'd be fine, but 99% of the time I stick to a trackpad, and I'm still not comfortable doing WASD+Trackpad.  It's not exactly WASD+Mouse!<br>2. WASD vs "A-D Rotation"  I personally prefer "object floating around circle" movement to be just left and right, with left ALWAYS being Anticlockwise,and right ALWAYS being clockwise..  ... But people regularly complain to me that that's "wrong"..  Make it an option.. Options are good.<br><br>As far as the mouse controls are concerned, the game doesn't feel like it would be amiss if it ONLY had the movement and fire buttons.. Spin around, always firing directly ahead..  And those controls would work just as well on keyboard, or a gamepad's analogue thumbstick, or even using just a mouse (Where left and right spin you around the circle, then first shoots)<br>In fact, thinking about a gamepad, you could have left thumbstick and left trigger control ship #1, and right thumbstick and right trigger control ship #2..<br><br>In addition, the movement could probably do with a little momentum, instead of just a direct One-to-One approach, but that's more of a taste thing.<br><br>Art style is "Large"..  or rather, Art is too large for the server!!!  If it were a one-time download, that'd be fine, but if you're planning on sticking to HTML5 then I'd seriously rethink the amount of art you have going on.<br><br>.. All I can think of for now. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Art, sound, music, it all gets stored in here.<br>I also have a number of BlitzMax tools in here, too.<br>If I tweak the indev art, I can simply run the accompanying BMax tool, and it'll re-render my sprites to the required .png images, and copy them directly to the /data folder<br>That way, I get to keep the high-Rez indev stuff, AND the low-Rez Ingame stuff, both together, but only the smaller files get used when it matters.<br><br>Takes a few attempts to get the right Dev-flow, but..  ...

Colorful interesting spaceships and asteroids and FX.<br><br>The play speed is very good as in your ship movement and overall game speed feel really "dialed-in". And I really like dual objective games like this. Not big on 1D game design ideas. Being able to not only destroy the aliens and asteroids but also repair the planet shield is excellent. Gives the game some added depth. Well done!<br><br>I don't have any real complaints about it. I suppose the controls could be tweaked slightly offering a choice of the current move control and the rotational move control. That being said, I think after playing the game a few times I would be able to control my ship like an ace pilot. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Some of the later levels were a bit odd as I wasn't sure until i figure that i was suppose to shoot at those tiny asteroids.
