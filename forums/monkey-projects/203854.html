In my latest version/revision/rewrite some features that are finished and implemented are:<br><br>Parent / Child Entity Relationship<br>Local / Global transformations<br>Bounds Culling<br>Z Ordering<br>Batch Drawing<br>Hashmap<br>Binary Tree<br>Sort Stack<br>Matrix and Vector functions<br>XML Parser<br>FPS and Delta Timing<br>Scenes<br>Layers<br>Labels<br>Sprites<br>SpriteAtlases<br>TextureAtlases<br>Fonts<br>Rectangle, Oval, Line<br>Targeted Single Touch Delegate with priority ordering<br><br>I have also added loaders for SpriteAtlases ( Zwoptex and TexturePacker ), Fonts ( Glyph Designer ) and.... I have spent the last 5 days solid with almost no sleep implementing Tiled TMX map support. Isometric, Orthogonal and Hexagonal maps can be load using CSV, base64 or XML encoding. Automatic batch drawing, layers, properties and fast clipping are all working. My parser also automatically expands layers so that they contain only one tileset reference per layer making it much quicker to render. Tiles can be animated, hidden, deleted, tinted, rotated etc etc. I still need to finish the sub level depth sorting to allow players to appear above or behind tiles across multiple layers but this is almost finished. <br><br>Here is a screenshot showing off a map + gfx from Flare rpg I'm using to test my loader.<br>Isometric:<br><br><img src="http://i45.tinypic.com/63vq5s.png"><br><br>And this one uses sprites drawn by Daniel Cook that I hacked about to get working. Haven't finished chopping up the shadow tiles yet. (Ignore the sorting error on the rock right hand side, that is me forgetting to delete an old layer before taking the screenshot, cba to take another! )<br>Orthogonal:<br><br><img src="http://i49.tinypic.com/e0qx4n.png"><br><br>I have a list of features still to implement that is so long it scares me... but I have already written a lot of the code, some during earlier tests and versions of this framework. I am aware that I could easily be a victim of the dreaded feature creep which is why I spent a few hours the other day prioritising features for the initial release... fingers crossed I'll be safe. <br><br>I will be selling this framework but it will be very at a reasonable price. The reason for this is due to the huge amount of man hours I've put into this; constantly redesigning and improving core functionality, testing out different implementations and ideas, learning new mathematical techniques, algorithms and data structures. So far it looks and feels like the hard work has paid off and I haven't had so much fun programming for years! Thank you Mark I'm a happy chappy! Hopefully I'll have some more fun things for you to look at soon! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If the FPS is changed during the game, the scheduled methods automatically adjust to keep the correct time and update rate. MAX FPS scheduled methods match the game FPS. Schedules can also be prioritised to call one before another (useful for collision) and they also have an optional delay. They can also be repeated or fired once. Schedules can also be removed from targets by providing the name of the method. These are very useful for adding custom update loops and restricting heavy math code to update less frequently.<br><br>Selectors are slightly different. They can be used to instantly call a custom method. They are great for immediate callbacks like button clicks. They too have an optional delay.<br><br>Callbacks are used to communicate between the framework and game classes. These are different still to Selectors and Schedules. For example, a VirtualInputCallback would be called when a virtual joystick is moved or not auto centred. The callback would pass the joystick instance in as a field; allowing the stick velocity to be obtained and modify the players screen position accordingly. I decided to use interfaces as it was less overhead and lead to cleaner code, fields do not have to be classInfo boxed like with a reflection approach.<br><br>A Selector Action has also been created to allow custom methods to be called during action sequences. For example, you might want to create a sequence action that first moves any coins picked up by the player from his or her location to a score icon on the HUD and then increase the score. This allows you to do that very easily by sequencing a MoveTo action and then your own method to update the score. Simple.<br><br>Sprite Animations can be loaded from file, stored in the cache for easy retrieval via name. FrameCallbacks have also been implemented, these fire when a sprite animation is showing a desired frame. This might trigger a particle effect, or check for close enemies and decrease their hp.<br><br>I hope to tackle Menus and Scene Transitions over the next few days and.... finally I've come up with a way of having split screen multiple cameras. My idea will allow each player to share game scenes or have their own (not appear on the same map). This will also allow players to adjust their settings without affecting the other players camera and could also be used to create two different loading screens and menu screens unique for each player. It should be pretty awesome if it works out like I've planned it in my head!!<br><br>Going to finish pimping up a little demo showing off the virtual joystick and animation stuff. Which has reminded me..  I wanted to implement a parallax layer class for the demo too, I'll see if I have time. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Multiple scenes can be rendered at once allowing multiplayer or multiview games possible, this also gives the freedom to transition each of the views separately (useful for entering/leaving rooms in an RPG). Of course you can also transition all views as whole too due the hierarchal nature of the framework.<br><br>Worlds persist while they are being rendered, allowing transitioning scenes to reference existing data if transitioning into an existing world. All of this is done automatically with no changes to implementation code, it just works.<br><br>Parallax layers have also been drastically improved, anything you add to the layer will wrap allowing you to break up the repetition of just one image looping. Of course this also allows you to randomly place decoration on the layer and this too will wrap. Parallax speed and wrapping does not interfere with any layers that are already moving (e.g. a parallax cloud layer with a move action)  so the clouds will scroll faster whilst the parallax is also scrolling. View zooming, scaling, rotation all work with the wrapping now and I've fixed the border seams problem too which is nice.<br><br>Single Touch and Multi Touch has been drastically improved, implemented classes can claim touches using the abstract methods and have a flag to prevent touches to propagate further down the delegate list. This allows very clever and complex touch systems to be implemented due to the priority sorting of each delegate in the list. Multi Touch allows very easy gesture recognition, a few basic gestures are included, pan, zoom, swipe. Touches also keep track of the number of taps allowing double taps.<br><br>Keyboard input mimics touches in the way it works, Multikey input allows for the fact that keys might be pressed together but register at slightly different times, this could allow players to land combos in fighting games with much less frustration.<br><br>Entities have been drastically improved too, matrix code cleaned up, a local and global matrix allows very fast point transformations and rendering. Bounding rects are now calculated using the absolute matrix which is much faster than transforming the corners and min/max the results.<br><br>Sprite, SpriteAtlas, NinePatch Sprites with automatic resizing for panels, frames, windows etc.<br>Really easy animation loading from sprite atlases, also allows any format of sequential frame numbering or lettering.<br><br>Physics and Collision Detection included swept SAT for bullets. Friction, Gravity, Bounce, drag, Constraints, Wheels, etc etc. Updated automatically, you just create a physics body with the properties desired and pass it to the physics word. It will update the linked entity and make it appear physically correctly. Quadtree and Spatial Grid are both finished and waiting to be implemented, both have optimised rebuilding methods to save time updating.<br><br>Actions have been hugely improved and added to, far too much to even talk about here. One of the cooler additions was the action timeline allowing really cool cutscenes or enemy formations to be handled with ease. All actions can be sequenced, spawned, repeated, reversed, have easing and can even have easing applied to easing that is applied to easing that is applied to a sequence that is applied to......etc etc. You get the idea.<br><br>Lots of supported programmes (more to come soon) with complete functionality:<br><br>Zwoptex<br>TexturePacker<br>GlyphDesigner<br>Tiled<br>Spine<br><br>So much more still that I haven't mentioned but I haven't got time now... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Touches also keep track of the number of taps allowing double taps. <br></div> Wow. Looks very promising! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Im using SAT for the collision detection along with Swept SAT for things like bullet detection. Physics is verlet based with a few different constraints for now, distance, spring, angle.  Circle, OBB and AABB Particles have been implemented, ( no rotation ). Wheel particle has been implemented, must remember where I found the amazing tutorial on that so I can link it!<br><br>The physics engine is a lightweight alternative to Box2D that will allow quicker and easier integration into your games. Particles are perfect for games that use a grid formation, TMX Collision will be integrated directly into Tiled via properties and a special layer. The TMXLoader will then be able to create the physics worlds automatically without having to add any extra code to your game. You will also be able to visually see the collisions from the design stage which should help to save some headaches!<br><br>Examples coming soon! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
