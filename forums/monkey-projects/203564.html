Some possible suggestions... maybe add some visible stats for the units to see what benefit the upgrades do? I wasn't sure what to spend money on, upgrades or more units. Some description of the upgrade could be good (if there is one, I apologise I was intensely placing units and might not have looked on the right part of the screen!). Occasionally the health bars of the enemies went off the screen which made it hard to see their health. Maybe add some path attacks that stay either for the round or a period of time? Oil to slow down the vehicles, fire tile that burns enemies as they pass over (could inflict a damage over time burn effect)? Blockades that stop the enemies movement until they shoot them down or bash through them? Enemies that shoot at your units? If I think of any more suggestions I'll let you know :)<br><br>Hurry up and make some more levels!! ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
