Anyway, one of the main things that side tracked me was the notion of procedurally generating the basis of each level and then going in and fixing things up to make it more of a game.<br><br>I had been generating the levels in a PHP script I had made and then importing them in to a BlitzMAX based editor, changing things and finally exporting them as a CSV ready to be loaded in Monkey. I got bored of this very quickly because I have an unnatural aversion to making and editing levels.<br><br>Which leads me on to Perling (which is a working title but might end up being the actual title). I converted a Perlin class I was using in PHP in to Monkey and have been messing around with it. Much like worms, the player will provide a word or phrase to generate the level.  This will also include randomly generating the "quests" within the level and I am hoping this could lead to some really fun levels that I hope people will share. On systems that allow it, I hope to include some sort of high score system too.<br><br>I'm yet to decide what exactly will be included in the game feature wise (e.g. enemies, skills and weapons) but I'm quite looking forward to it because I really enjoy making things, but am rubbish at actually implementing them. Because Perling will be procedurally generated, I won't have to worry about it!

When putting together placeholder art I'll often start by finding an image that has an overall colour tone that matches the sort of look I want. I'll then get busy with the eye-dropper tool and pick out colours from the image that I then use as a reference palette for creating the actual art.<br><br>Or I just create horrid clashing primary colour assets and hand them to an artist (or a good graphic/web design person) to do a quick fix up specifically to create a palette. That works too. :)<br><br>I've been thinking of making a palette/swatch extraction tool for this purpose. I don't know if it will ever reach the top of my todo list though. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
