This time around in porting and development I am going to design a 2D gaming framework which will focus on fast game play with high entity counts, GUI and user interface, world editor and a server and client. I have learned from developing Phoenix USC that the best solution (for me) is to develop a integrated gaming framework I can use to develop other games. So I am going to do just that. <br><br>The above video is a test of the GUI, user interface and physics code I have ported and developed to date (for Monkey X). In this redesign I have decided to expand and exploit the GUI systems and layer in a user interface framework  that handles the menus and other interfaces. The user interface system now has scripting and all of the background images (mock menu) use it. The script system will handle lots of other neat user interface object as well as aid in server-side management. I have included the script code used in this demo, not LUA but I think good enough for an interface system.<br><br>I have have a good base of code with my work on Phoenix USC all in BlitzMax but all of it written to port to Monkey X. So I have a great opportunity to design an awesome gaming framework and if MX2 has decent networking an online one at that. :)<br><br>Off to code,<br><br>Current interface script.<br><textarea class=codebox name="code" wrap=OFF readonly="true" rows="15" cols="80">

I am basically porting over what I did with Phoenix USC and establishing an independent gaming framework. The gaming framework includes what you would need to code a game including physics, mapping, user interface, graphic interface, networking and more. If it were not for all the work I have already done (Phoenix USC) this would be a 'tall order' indeed but fortunately all of what I did in BltzMax will port over to Monkey X with only minor efforts. So as I do port over code I am taking the time to organize it all into a very seamless and efficient gaming framework all of it in native Monkey X code (that's the plan :) ).<br><br>In viewing the above video you can get a good sense of how the framework preforms and just how useful the graphic user interface is. The window or maybe a better description would be container based GUI allows a great degree of flexibility. The gaming framework exploits the window system by having one branch/hop access to the rendering window images (images included in window image draw list). Where the Monkey X program adds an image to a window image draw list and it is drawn on the next window update which adds near zero lag to image draw to display times. Images are managed by the window system along with view port clipping (fully adjustable) and aspects like rotation, alpha, blend and position. All this makes it incredibly easy to draw images to windows and not have to worry about any management. You can also draw images to windows once and let the window system manage them, later clearing/removing them when needed.<br><br>I have also ported my weapons system which uses the physics framework. Each 'bullet' is it's own entity. So all the inertia aspects can be applied like velocity, spin, angle, friction, gravity and more. This makes for awesome effects in weapons physics wise and coupled with animated images for bullets renders a nice gaming experience. Using the methods I have now I can maintain about 5000 entities on a low-end duel core PC with on-board video and still have reasonable gaming performance. This is based on what I can do in Phoenix USC and that's on top of managing a map, rendering it and managing collision. So much of what I am bringing into this game framework is tested and designed for high entity counts.<br><br>I am also continuing work on the user interface system which is in place to use scripts (see above post) to manage all the user interfaces in a game. This has the advantage of being able to load in user interface script files that configure the interfaces for a particular platform. The goal here is to just use a default script file to setup the user interfaces so that you could have a PC script or a mobile script and the interfaces will automatically adapt.<br><br><b>Android/Mobile</b><br>I have this running on Android and am just getting it up to seed. So far the interface performs well. With increased landing zones for window resize spots the experience is very 'CSI' like (ya know the cool future touch interfaces). Being able to manage and move windows like that is a neat thing. On my 11.6" tablet my brain immediately surged with ideas and uses for it. Still the GUI/User Interface can easy be adapted to suit so many kinds of mobile interfaces including more tradition styles. Touch controls are a fairly easy thing to implement as they can be in topmost windows and have buttons or other controls, I will be adding those here shortly and posting a video of all of this on a Android tablet. <br><br><strike>At present Monkey X does not support external keyboard input, which is sad (hoping for external hardware support in MX2)</strike>. Using the keyboard and track pad provided on many tablets today really gives you that PC experience (especially when using a mouse) when used with the gaming frameworks GUI in the above configuration. So sweet for more complex tasks or games. So at present I will work on some sort of touch only interface for player controls.<br><br>I am just getting started with this project but I am making great progress and really getting to know Monkey again. ;)<br>- Rich -<br><br>'<br>Edit - It appears I was in error (not the first time :D ) and Monkey X <b>does support external keyboards</b>. It may just be an issue with certain keys I was using exclusively  that may not work. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It is the same exact code as before (above post - Windows demo) except for additional touch support code which looks for two separate touches. The GUI component framework now supports multiple touches (2 for now). It was not to hard to add and allows the GUI components framework to work with more then one button at a time (most GUI components use the button class). So the result is the ability to have on screen controls where certainly more then one button is being pressed. By the way I put some on screen controls in a window and demo them about mid video.<br><br>Let me know what you think of this running on Android. It's just a straight up use of the GUI/UI for PC and on my 11.6" tablet and is sure fun to mess around with. With Phoenix USC I am aiming at tablets and displays equal to or larger then 9", but the gaming framework can be made to support almost any display. I really believe tablet gaming (larger the better) is the next big thing for gaming on Android and most of the data I have looked at bares this out quite obviously. Tablet gaming looks to be the most profitable and fastest growing segment of the Android gaming market and the Alien Phoenix 2D gaming framework will focus on supporting it. This means more complex and richer interfaces as an option and even a more PC like experience. For example this test on android functions just like the PC version when the tablet uses a Bluetooth mouse. <br><br>With this test I wanted to make sure the gaming framework was going to run OK on Android and it does. The performance is very similar to my duel core desktop with on board video (Emachines..ek). So I am fairly impressed by the performance I am getting and the gaming framework looks good on Android. I will be stepping back a bit and now working on the user interface scripting and support code and smoothing out some other issues. <br><br>So far so good though, :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Above is my GUI running in a native 1280x720 and the same GUI app scaled down very small in Glfw. It actually works very well using a virtual resolution in mojo2 provided by mojo2's SetViewPort() and SetProjection2d(). This virtual resolution allows the GUI to work in any resolution and still function as intended. A very useful feature for tablets / mobile and PC's and will make it easy to layout the interface for one resolution and the framework will automatically scale to fit any given display.<br><br>The colors are off as I am still changing all the SetColor() commands to work with mojo2's 0-1 format. I should mention that mojo2 SetScissor() does not work seamlessly with SetViewPort() so you have to scale the variables manually to match the view port.<br><br>So I am converting the rest of my framework and then back to development. ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The above video is a look at the recent changes to the gaming interface (GUI). Of special note is use of a projection matrix which keeps a static virtual resolution in this case 1280x720. So the GUI/Interface is automatically scaled to the device display dimensions. It even works when changing the device orientation from landscape to portrait (as seen in above.. mid video). The framework interface will adapt the projection matrix (and much more) to the device orientation dimensions. <br><br>I am also using the GUI button framework to add a 'dish' style navigation control which works great for the game application I am building. It affords really accurate control and a natural feel when testing. I've also added slider control to the console window which now uses a string array managed by the window framework. Changes have also been made to window borders, now more accurate on resize corners and boarders now disappear when maximized. Lots of other little fixes.<br><br>So after converting my "studio" operations here to Linux it feels great to finally get back to coding. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I am happy to say that it is all working awesomely and is 'Very' efficient with each window supporting an Independent list of buttons and GUI components as well as a draw list (draw images, text and mojo2 render). This and other consideration in design make this GUI perfect for gaming. As it stands now the core architecture is well defined and functioning well so it is now time to flesh out the GUI components.<br><br><b>List Boxes and Menus</b><br>Below are a few screen shots of list boxes used in the GUI. I have reworked my code to support '4' images per button, one for up, down, highlight and selected. This makes for really detailed and flexible buttons especially when supported by framework commands like SetHighlightColor(), SetHighlightAlpha(), SetHighlightBlend() and alike. Each button (or list box element) can have a separate button image for all four states of action as well as '4' states of color, blend and alpha. In the first list box image below you can see the highlight element in the list box using BlendMode.Additive as well as a custom color and alpha. When it comes to list boxes you can customize list box button elements as a group or individually and this even extends to changing individual list box button element images. So the up shot here is list boxes are very customizable as well as buttons and sliders.<br><br>I will be using the list box class to support menus. As it stands now list boxes can have a slider on the left or right or no slider at all. So with some small modifications the list box class can support a menu class. The plan is to support at least a first level slider option for menus which may extent to sub-menus. Since the list boxes provide support for element images menus should really function and look sweet. I should add that the GUI loads a resource file to 'skin' and initialize. So all of the GUI components (buttons, list boxes, sliders, more) are ready to go with all of the default color, blend, alpha and images. This allows for a overall theme and lots of customization.<br><br><img src="http://www.phoenixusc.com/Personal_Post_Data/newlistbox1.jpeg"><br><b>This list box (over rendered mojo2 scene) uses customized color, alpha, blend for its button elements. The slider is also customized using list box framework commands (alpha, color, blend). Shown in cursor highlight state.</b><br>.<br><br><img src="http://www.phoenixusc.com/Personal_Post_Data/newlistbox2.jpeg"><br><b>This is a list box using the default skin and framework values. Shown in cursor highlight state.</b><br>.<br><br><img src="http://www.phoenixusc.com/Personal_Post_Data/newlistbox3.jpeg"><br><b>Also using the default skin but shown with the cursor element state in the mouse/button down state. Each button (or list box element) has '4' images for each button (or list box element) state as well as the color, alpha and blend states.</b><br>.<br><br>So I still have a lot to do but I am in the home stretch as it were. With the core architecture firmly in place fleshing out the rest of the GUI components will happen quickly. After I have menus and a list box view in place I will move on to a text area component which will allow in game editing and so much more. <br><br>Off to code.<br>- Rich - <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I have a little screen icon (you can see upper right background screen) which when clicked will cast that window to the background. You can think of it as sort of a bottom-most window (really a bit more complicated). Once cast all other windows will appear above it and work normally. Clicking on the cast window (background screen) activates it and all the GUI components will work normally (with all other windows above the cast window). Super cool and so right for gaming. I'll have a video up here in a day or two (soon) which should give you a good idea of how this works. <br><br>I'm also exploring virtual screens and I think I can make that happen code wise. Anyway, I was so exited casting worked I had to post about it. <br><br>Off to code,<br>- Rich - <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So looking at the image above you can see the background screen is composed of a background image, animated image (under my logo) and a static image (my logo).

</textarea><br><br>I also have the background screen casting feature working well and it really solves many issues regarding managing windows. Casting windows to the background is just a sweet feature. It allows any window to be cast full-screen to the background screen and automatically stops drawing the occluded scripted background screen images for efficiency. The same occlusion efficiency is done for maximized windows where any open window is not updated or drawn while occluded. I will have a video of this up shortly here. :) <br><br>I thought I would mention that at some point I want to make this framework available to my fellow Monkey coders (cost? not sure yet). So if you are a fan of what I'm up to you will be able to use this framework for your applications and games. I am planning to release the GUI framework first as it is the core architecture for the gaming framework and it manages all of the graphic user interface, background screen, windows and more and works seamlessly with mojo2 and Monkey (got to love native coded frameworks). Also I believe that this framework is flexible enough to work with existing gaming frameworks (although I have never tried any of them :O ). I will be fleshing out more about how to code for Alien Phoenix and sharing more about it's flexibility along the way. There is so much that this framework does I will have to lay it all out in several posts.<br><br>Personally I am very happy with the results and once finished, I believe you will not find a better, more efficient, flexible and capable GUI framework (gaming) for Monkey-X anywhere (not even third party). :D <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You will also, it appears. have to layer collision. Aside from that it has preformed well and I am still exploring how and what it does. Right now I am able to support two separate scenes with independent collision, impact and other lighting. The AP (Alien Phoenix) framework does support any number of renderer and layer instances.<br><br>The lighting for the collision impacts is using two lights which pulls off a nice lighted impact effect (looks sweet) in real-time. It is quite convincing and the shadow casters really add to the effect of lighted impacts. I have impact animated sprites also showing as part of the the impact effect. So the impact effect is a combination of an animated sprite and a light underneath. Looks just great in real-time and I will have a video up shortly.<br><br>I will be doing more prototyping to reveal the best path forward for lighting, mapping and collision, but I think things are off to a good start. <br><br>Off to code,<br>- Rich - <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Pushing things I can get about 5 million map objects in a map space before some issues seem to crop up. The map space is 83+ million pixels wide and can be larger. The map objects are simple and just include an image and it's coordinates but it is the coolest thing to generate millions of objects and have the map system manage and display them. <br><br>I'll have some more details soon. As it is now the entire map is held in ram (memory) and I am still working through the architecture but things look promising for large map spaces and very high map object counts. The 'leaf' portion of the treemap has been tested with several hundred map objects and in this case a leaf is part of a cell that is 1280x720px.

I have implemented an architecture that is based on the quadtree idea but goes further then the a 2x2 block matrix and uses no subdivision on the rendering or drawing end of things which makes it efficient. The map is initialized by using a root of say 128x128 with each root node extended out to a child cell block of say 128x128 with each cell representing the display size (1280x720 in this case) . Each child cell then has a leaf list which is made up of all the map objects that are to be displayed. The system works well and the performance is great and with a root node block size of 128x128 and a child cell block size of 128x128 I can easily hold 2 million map object within memory and have a map size in pixels of 20,971,520px wide (root_width*cell_width*1280) and 11,796,480px in height . This for my Phoenix USC project is a huge space for an arena style game and will work for many other game concepts. On the rendering or drawing end of things there is no subdivision needed as all of it is baked into the tree structure so all I have to do is is extrapolate the child cell and leaf list that is in view (based on actor position). Typically there are always four child cells in view with each child cell having it's own leaf list of map objects.<br><br>The biggest reason to have everything in memory as opposed to smaller chunks is to avoid non ram access which on a server for example would not be a good thing. Also when using an authoritative server it is advantages to have the entire map in memory as the server needs to manage the entire map all at once. Typically I would think that a map is not going to have every child cell / leaf filled with map objects so 2 million is a fair stress test and on my cheap tablet runs well (no lighting). Another advantage using this style of tree mapping is I can include collision data within the leaf object list which gives me performance. Since the system is already working with a map object (in this case the leaf list of map objects would include vertices's) it is a simple matter to pass vertices's to a collision class and perhaps even shadow vertices's as well.<br><br>So the next step is to start to layer things up and see how that works out. My outlook is optimistic and I believe I can run several layers of tree maps even on mobile devices. As soon as I have that working I will post a video and explain a bit more on what I am up to.<br><br>Off to code,<br>- Rich - <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Each cell has it's own list (really an array ATM) of map objects so it just a simple matter of drawing objects that are in view within the viewable cell. If you look at post #35 I kind of explain how I am doing this (not AABB). I am working on a little tutorial that hopefully will layout the specifics along with a code example. It's actually pretty simple code wise (at it's core just stuffing map objects into a node/tree structure) and there are a few limitations in regards to memory usage  (above 2 million can use up memory) but at 2 million it's only a few hundred kilobytes (maybe a bit more). It is however very friendly in performance and cost very little in the way of CPU usage.<br><br>So check back later (I'll need a week or so with my current schedule... super busy) and I'll have a tutorial. ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The map system now uses a parts system that manages all parts for the map system. What is a part? It is an object that holds all of the data needed to be added to the map systems as a map element. So a part object would include the image, alpha, blend, color, collision data and more. The part system loads two text files which hold this data and below are example of the data in these text files. With these two files a part can be described and defined as a part object and then can be used throughout the map as map elements. I'll explain more on this later but the basic idea here is you define part objects and then place or add them to the map space (you can have lots of map spaces or layers).<br><br>I also wanted to mention about the frameworks efficiency and performance. In the above video (post #43) you can see the mapping system running in a full-screen (maximized) window. In that mode the CPU usage on my 3.8ghz quad core is 3% (yes that little) and in the multiple window mode (3 windows in view) the CPU usage is 11%. These kinds of CPU usage numbers are what you need to have a shot at mobile devices. I believe I can reduce the higher 11% number down a little bit further which means CPU usage is not a factor when using this framework and mobile devices.<br><br>As soon as I have the collision aspect of the part and map systems going (very close to having it working) I will post a video of the Alien Phoenix framework running on an Android tablet using the 'exact' same map and 'window based' GUE as is on the PC. Looking around the net I have not seen anything like my approach and if things continue to workout as well as they have this framework will provide the first truly seamless window based GUE/GUI for PC and mobile. This should be noteworthy and I may put together a simple shoot'em up style space game to test the reaction to this unique and useful gaming framework. I think it's cool of course, but I hope others do too. :)<br><br>Part data file.<br><textarea class=codebox name="code" wrap=OFF readonly="true" rows="15" cols="80">

The issue for me is should I charge or not and to be honest I am still not sure how I want to approach this issue. Typically, my experience is successful frameworks related to BRL products have charged for the use of a framework or module. I can see why as maintaining, promoting and supporting a framework over time is costly in time and money; for example I have almost a year of development in this project to date. Playniax's Pyro (and his other products) is a good example of author support and development and may be a model I will pick up on. His products are up to date and supported largely impart to his passion I bet but also the monetary component that helps support costs (website, hardware, time invested and so on) . I think this is a path I may emulate.<br><br>My goal is to provide a useful gaming framework that is supported, maintained and constantly improved. To do this I believe that some sort of licensing would be an option to consider. For example allowing the framework to be used under license for free in a non-commercial setting and for a fee in a commercial setting. This appeals to me and might be what I ultimately choose to do. The bottom line for me is to make the framework self sustaining in that the costs and time invested have some return.<br><br>I am open to suggestions if anyone has an idea on this topic. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The differences in the two make it difficult to maintain two code bases.

The first is a map tree which is used for the bulk of the map and supports collision and hundreds of thousands of map elements. The second class is map image. Map images are generally used for background/foreground elements in a map and like map tree can be layered. Both systems create a map space that you put elements (parts for map tree and images for map image) into and each map space (or layer) can be drawn independently. This give a nice degree of flexibility when constructing a map. <br><br>The map tree collision can be used independently as well and for example if you want several layers (or map spaces) of collision you need only add map parts defined with collision vertices to a map space. You can then draw the map space, or not, ( DrawMap() ) and then additionally check the map space for collision ( MapCollision() ). Using the physics (simple inertia for now) and collision (also fairly simple but simple is good and fast) frameworks you can pass along a physics objects position using MapCollision() which returns true if a collision has occurred. You can then poll GetCollisionNormal() to retrieve the normal and also GetCollisionCoord() to get the collision coordinates. I'll probably be adding a GetMapElement() to return the map element or part involved in the collision plus other methods to assist in interactions.<br><br>So thats sort of a simple overview of how the map and collision systems work as of now. I'm still fleshing out how I want to approach this but, so far, it is working out well. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Below is the code it took to make the list box above (ON Monkey 2). All of it save, CreateListBox() (could use New() instead) and AddElement() are 'not' needed as the default settings could be used (predefined color, images, blends and more). But, if you wanted to customize a list box there are more then a few commands to do it with. I am converting this all to Monkey 2 and I am reworking some of the code to better fit it. I plan to leave this as it is (the commands / methods) as I do not see a benefit to making this all property based. I thought for those using Monkey 2 (or planning to) I'd see what you might think on the subject.<br><br><textarea class=codebox name="code" wrap=OFF readonly="true" rows="15" cols="80">

I can't begin to describe the difference from my old 19". Love it! Aside from a giant screen I can now see way better color definition which is what I need for game art/assets development. Such a treat to work with code on this.<br><br>I also just bought a Zotac GTX 950 AMP! video card . It should be here Friday. :D With the new monitor I can now push forward in development as my current video card and monitor were not letting me get the job done. The Zotac GTX 950 AMP! benchmarks at about 90% of the performance of a GTX 960, is less expensive and has better compatibility with Linux (I use Linux as a development platform) then the GTX 960. It also uses less power with a 90 watt rating (uses a 6 pin connector). So overall a very good bang for the buck.<br><br>I finally saved enough to get what I needed. It's awesome to step out of a 720p world and into a 1080p one and this new graphic card should let me capture video without any issues. <br><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013P30MVK/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" target="_blank">Zotac GTX 950 AMP!</a> on amazon. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The map now supports rotation for all of the background asteroids, so they all rotate (except collision layer ones) in this map. Additionally I have made some tweaks to the parallax layers for better viewing.  I've also added a new planet (larger size) and a new star field background. The new hardware has proven to be nice and useful. <br><br>I've been working on converting the Alien Phoenix framework to Monkey 2 (video shows app made with Monkey-X)  which is going well and affording the opportunity to improve things. I've been a little sidetracked by new hardware but that's a nice diversion to have. Anyway, back on track. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
