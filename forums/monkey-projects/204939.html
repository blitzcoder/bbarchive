As soon as I find a bit of time, I will make a blogpost on my homepage about the system.<br><br>The next big part in beta 0.6.0 was the rebalancing of all the stuff as the former numbers were mainly placeholders.

This means, the UI got some enhancements whereas the biggest one you can find on the encounter and enviroment screen.

With the inspection mode, you can find out what content is unlocked by battling the encounter or by searching through the enviroment. Should provide a bit of a tactical note to the game :-)<br>On the inventory screen you now sell unneeded items for a small amount of XP and sometimes a key.

However, I find myself just clicking like a mad man on all the encounters. The ones I can handle "safely," I just click. Then I click the ones where I don't take too much damage. In other words, not a lot of thought is going into my combat selections. Seemingly, not a lot of strategy is required.<br><br>Is this like a puzzle, and you find the best route? If so, there needs to be a metric (and maybe there already is) for establishing proficiency (say, experience points, gold, or a score based on multiple parameters). We obviously have to know how well we played the game.<br><br>Also, I completed the Level 0 dungeon and upon clicking it again, everything seemed to have been reset. That doesn't seem right to me. I played it, cleared it, and so I should keep all the assets obtained during that level, and it shouldn't be available to me any longer...
