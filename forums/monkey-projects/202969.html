I spent about 4-5 hours today adding a level editor demo into Objecty<br><br><iframe width="560" height="345" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/7W793QgGZH8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><br>This is a fully functioning editor and it ties into Objecty's existing texture packing so tiles are single surface packed instead of an image-strip. This means we can also do cool stuff like edge colour bleeding on each tile!<br><br>Eventually I could expand it to allow placing of sprites, shapes and boned characters. If it took me 4 hours to get here, imagine what a months worth of development would achieve!<br><br>Objecty does all of exporting via lua scripts so it will be really easy to support the wealth of runtimes out there. The scripts folder is available to the public so there are no limitations on what exporters you can write. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
