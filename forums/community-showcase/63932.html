It wasn't exactly the sort of thing I'd requested, (The original concept was to have the raccoon clinging to the front of the rocket for dear life and heading in a downwards direction off the screen.) but when you hire a good artist sometimes they get creative, and with my suggestion for the aviator goggles and scarf I think the end result is pretty spiffy.  It certainly will accomplish its goal of making people remember the company name, which itself is already fairly unique and memorable. (Which is why I chose it in the first place.)<br><br>Oh and the background is just something I threw together quickly, so I'll be fixing that up later.  And the logo itself was done by me several months ago.  You may remember I posted it here.<br><br><img src="http://raccoonrocket.com/raccoonrocket-logo3.jpg"><br><br>Lemme know what you think! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I chose it specifically because it is catchy, short, and easy to remember, and realtively easy to spell.  <br><br>Rocketeer brings to mind that Disney movie.  I don't want people to reminded of that (or to be sued by Disney), and Raccoon Rocket fits the picture perfectly well.  There is a raccoon, and there is a rocket.  <br><br>I don't hear anyone complaining about Rooster Teeth's logo or name.  Names don't have to make sense!  In fact the less sense they make the more memorable they are.  Case in point:  Monster.com.  Amazon.com.  Valve.<br><br>You think Raccoon Ballistics rolls off the toungue easier than Raccoon Rocket?  Are you mad?  Also, Ballistics is longer and would lead to four times as many misspelled url's.  And it's not as easy to remember.<br><br><br>Also, I don't know why anyone has a problem with the text.  Sure it might not be the most awesome text logo ever, but it doesn't exactly look cheap or bad.  I do have a couple ideas for improving it that I will try, like adding a tail to the word Raccoon and/or some kind of speed lines or fire to the word Rocket.  But it would cost me a few hundred to have the artist create a whole new logo.  Do you think it's worth that much for a slightly more interesting logo, when you have companies like id who are perfectly successful with a logo that is just the word id in lowercase in a plain looking font with nothing around it?<br><br><br>And as I already stated, twice, the background will be redone.  That one is just temporary.  But I haven't decided if I want to fork over a few hundred to have the artist redo that or if I'll be doing it myself.  It really doesn't need to be that detailed, it is just a background and shouldn't distract from the logo with lots of detail anyway.  And the logo will only be seen for a second anyway.<br><br><br>Finally, as for the prospects of making a game with the character, I wouldn't hold my breath. :-)<br><br>I'm glad you like the character...  but platform games take years to make and lots of artwork (ask Anthony Flack, who's on year FOUR of Cletus), and they don't sell that well.  <br><br>Plus trying to take a cool looking character and design a game around him (rather than designing the character around the game) rarely results in a good game.  <br><br><br>I'm gonna stick with casual games for now! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I saw this post yesterday and without seeing the logo again, I would have forgotten the name.<br><br>When I came up with a few names for a game company, I told 2 of my favorites to 7 or 8 people. I waited 2-4 weeks and randomly asked those people out of nowhere if they remembered the names I mentioned to them. Everyone remembered Gellyware. <br><br>If you asked me 2 weeks from now what the name of your company would be, I would remember the Racoon part but not the rocket. For some reason Racoon Toon comes to mind as a more memorable name.<br><br>The logo is too big with all of that background going on. Maybe if you could work the name of the company around the racoon somehow it would be much more elegant. That logo does work for game splash screens, but I do not think it would work well for a website (without taking up a huge real estate). It might be more effective to just drop the background all together.<br><br>In the end, I'm not sure how much any of this 'really' matters unless you plan on getting huge like pop-cap or big fish games. Your traffic will come from places that have either text or image links from some form of advertisement so it doesnt matter if your name was Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious... people would just click the link or image if they were curious about your company or know of a game that you've released.<br><br>The only thing I wouldn't do is rush the logo no matter what it is.

Because anyone can just stick the name of an animal in front of entertainment, or games, or software, and there are a million companies out there that do that?  Does "Shark Software" sound at all exciting or different?  No.  "Squirrel Software" is a little better.  But that's because Squirrel is a verb, so in addition to being an animal it also implies action.  Rocket is a verb.  Raccoon + Rocket = a name with action.  Raccoon + Entertainment = no action.<br><br>Also: <br>RaccoonRocket.com <br>RaccoonEntertainment.com<br><br>I was trying to keep the URL short.  And <a href="http://raccoongames.com" target="_blank">http://raccoongames.com</a> was taken.  (You wanna see a crappy logo, go there!)  And every other set of game related words that were shorter that I stuck together.  So I went for something different.<br><br>I'm not making up excuses here!

It looks more like they tried to tell you it didn't flow or sound right but you didn't listen then and now it's too late.  But 4 months ago you had already bought the website.

Rocket CAN be a verb. :-) The way you're using it, it's the noun in the sentence with Raccoon being the adjective.  That's the whole reason it doesn't flow.  Because there's no such thing as a raccoon rocket.<br><br>Look at:<br>Gas Powered Games<br>Irrational Games<br><br>What kind of games were they? Gas Powered!<br>What kind of games were they?

Just ask me and I'll tell you. :-)<br><br>So...bottom line is.  It's your game company name.  If you want it to be 2 nouns slapped together then more power to you.  Just make it synonymous with great games (think EA or Bioware) and you're good to go.  But you should really learn to take criticism better.  And definitely read Swords and Circuitry.  There's a section in there where Chris Roberts finally realizes he can't be the producer, designer, artist, programmer, and sound engineer.  He learned team dynamics and how important they are. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
