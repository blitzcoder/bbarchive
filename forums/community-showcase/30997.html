The BlitzPlus version is the faster one by far, especially with triple buffering enabled.<br><br>[/update]<br><br><br><br>SwiftBOBS is a system designed for handling 2D sprites, reffered to in the system as BOBS, which is an homage to the term used for sprites on the Amiga.<br><br>With SwiftBOBs, creating 2D moving objcts is very easy.<br><br>Just load your image, call CreateBOB(), and off you go.  A single flag enables masking, if you use the default masking color.  <br><br>And if you want, you can change the mask color for each BOB individually, or for a whole group of BOBS that use the same image, at once.  <br><br>And this is just the tip of the iceberg.<br><br>Not only does the system make it simple to create sprites, but it supports every blending mode you get with 3D graphics in Blitz3D.  Add, Multiply, Multiply x2...  You can even do alpha blending if you specify an image to use as an alpha map.<br><br>Blending does come at a price however.  It incurs a pretty significant performance hit.  But it's there if you need it.   Just don't expect to draw a hundred antialiased things at once. <br><br>You can also change the base color that the BOB's image is multiplied with, just like on an entity in Blitz 3D, and you can change the overall alpha of the BOB.  <br><br>When not using the special blending modes, or the color shifting, or the alpha transparency, the system is lightning fast, as you can see in the demo.  On my system I had 2000 24bit color 30x30 masked sprites moving around at 60fps.  So when blitting normally you get no less than you have come to expect from Blitz.<br><br>To achieve maximum performance, the system has FOURTEEN seperate blitting functions, each one optimized for a specific task.  A normal blit uses the standard image blitting functions which are super fast, while the special blending modes use highly optimized functions specifically designed for each combination of blending operations.<br><br>Here is a list of all the functions included in the system: (minus the internal blending functions) <br><br><br>InitializeBOBS()<br><br>CreateBOB.BOB(Image, Flags=1)<br>FreeBOB(ThisBOB.BOB)<br><br>BOBBlend(ThisBOB.BOB, BlendingMode)<br>BOBAlpha(ThisBOB.BOB, Alpha#)<br>BOBAlphaMap(ThisBOB.BOB, AlphaMap)<br>BOBColor(ThisBOB.BOB, Color_R, Color_G, Color_B)<br>BOBMask(ThisBOB.BOB, Mask_R, Mask_G, Mask_B)<br>MaskBOBS(Image, Mask_R, Mask_G, Mask_B)<br>BOBOrder(ThisBOB.BOB, Order)<br>BOBFrame(ThisBOB.BOB, Frame)<br>BOBFlags(ThisBOB.BOB, Flags)<br><br>ShowBOB(ThisBOB.BOB)<br>HideBOB(ThisBOB.BOB)<br><br>PositionBOB(ThisBOB.BOB, Position_X#, Position_Y#)<br>TranslateBOB(ThisBOB.BOB, Offset_X#, Offset_Y#)<br><br>SetViewport(X1, Y1, Width, Height)<br><br>UpdateBOBS()<br><br>BOBS_Overlap(FirstBOB.BOB, SecondBOB.BOB)<br>BOBS_Collide(FirstBOB.BOB, SecondBOB.BOB)<br>BOB_RectOverlap(ThisBOB.BOB, Rect_X, Rext_Y, Rect_Width, Rect_Height)<br>BOB_RectCollide(ThisBOB.BOB, Rect_X, Rext_Y, Rect_Width, Rect_Height)<br><br>BOBX#(ThisBOB.BOB)<br>BOBY#(ThisBOB.BOB)<br><br><br>Now that you've read about it, try the demo, and see for yourself.  Most functionality is represented in the demo,<br>and there's lots of options to play with.<br><br>I have included one demo compiled in Blitz3D, and one compiled in BlitzPlus, so that you can see the perfromance differences between the two.<br><br>I highly reccomend you use BlitzPlus if you're going to make a 2D game that uses any special blending modes, but both BlitzPlus and Blitz3D are extremely fast with regular masked blitting.<br><br>And finally, if you're interested in purchasing a license for the system, the terms are the same as for all my other systems.  $15 for shareware/freeware, $100 for commercial use.  Payment is accepted through paypal to scswift@..., Western Union, or via bank transfer.<br><br>See my worklog for additonal details.<br><br><br>But wait... there's more!<br><br><br>If you are familiar with my FLUX and Anibrush systems, then you'll like this...  <br><br>I plan to port both to a single system for animating BOBS in much the same way that they now work on 3D objects.  With just a few simple commands you'll be able to have BOBS weaving back and forth in sine wave patterns, becoming more and less transparent, while animating their image, in looped, one shot, or ping-pong animation modes.  <br><br>This will be a FREE addition to the BOB system when completed. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So, you're pushing around 450,000 pixels per frame with those numbers.  And that doesn't count redrawing the background.<br><br>Triple buffering is easy to implement in your game and does not require any special programming to handle your other graphics.  <br><br>To do triple buffering, all you need do is create an image the same size as your screen, and Setbuffer ImageBuffer(Triplebuffer) at the start of your program.  All draw operations will then go to the triple buffer.  Then just before you flip, you set the back buffer to be the draw buffer, copy the triplebuffer to the back buffer with drawblock(), reset the triple buffer to the draw buffer, and the flip.<br><br>That's all there is to it!<br><br>The reason this works is because it is much faster in BlitzPlus to read pixels from an image, than it is to read them from the screen.  And blending operations need to read a lot of pixels.  This method will NOT improve the performance of the system with Blitz 3D however. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

And that's only if you use triple buffering.  And that 5-10fps presumes one can find a way to do one poke per pixel rather than 3 when reading/writing 24bit color data... getitng it down to 2 would be easy, but getting it down to 1 would require major effort.  <br><br>In addition, one would need to support every pixel format.<br><br>Given that I have fourteen functions now, if I were to support every pixel format I would need 42 functions.  And trying to write each pixel in one poke would double the size of each function because I'd need to write pixels in two seperate loops.<br><br>And lastly, as far as I know, that DLL is likely to break in any new update of Blitz... I've been following some imagebank stuff people have been talking about lately, and it relies on the ability to get the data from Blitz' internal structures in an unsupported manner.  ONE CHANGE to that structure in Blitz, and the whole thing will blow up.<br><br>All in all, it would be a huge headache, and given the lack of interest in these functions so far, completely not worth the headaches.

However in the demo because I'm just using the pshere graphics, all those black pixels around the edge really slowed multiply down compared to add which only had to draw the center of the sphere.  This optimization would be handy if one were to draw pure black shadows behind things, with some fading at the edges.<br><br>I also just tested a new rendering method I call a difference buffer, but it turned out to be a dead end, and did not improve performance.  <br><br>The difference buffer used a two layer array that stored the current front and back buffer.  This was compared to the triple buffer I was writing to, and if any pixel differed, they were updated in the array, and then plotted to the screen.  <br><br>This optimization worked under the presumption that writing to the screen buffer would be slower than reading from the image buffer.  But it turned out not to be.  Besides which, this method of rendering would only have accelerated situations where the background remains largely static.  In that way, it was similar to a dirty rectange type of system, which I also have not implemented, because that would force one to render only bobs and stuff overlaid over bobs, and would not accelerate any kind of game which requires a scrolling background, which I imagine a lot of people want to have. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There's been no side effects that I know of, and I can't guarantee it, but I strongly doubt the method will break unless Mark does something drastic with image/texture buffers (like upgrade to DX9? hehe).<br><br>Don't judge it before at least trying it!, it may or may not benefit your system :)<br><br>Tom <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Knowing that, I know that using it will only provide moderate performance increases.  If it made it 10x faster I'd consider using it, but it will at most increase the speed by 2x.<br><br>And I know that the method relies on the internal strucutres of Blitz remaining the same so you can get the format of the image and the width of the buffer.  One change to those and the whole thing blows up.  <br><br>And I'm pretty sure that it only works in B3D, so I'd have to code a seperate system for BlitzPlus.<br><br>So it's just not worth it.  Anyhow, only like one person has shown any real interest in the system at all.  As far as I'm concerned, it's as optimized as I want it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
