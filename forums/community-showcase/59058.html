An as you go hint/help system would be good too.<br><br>As far as the graphics go. Okay they are not super, but fit the game quite well IMO and to be honest once I was trying to play it I didn't really notice them.<br><br>Did have problems when swapping things in that there was no indication that you had selected anything to swap. Once I was clicking on atoms for ages thinking it had all locked up as nothing seemed to be happening. Then i clicked on one of my bonus/spare atoms and it went into the grid and everything seemed back to normal.<br><br>In summary could be fun, but too hard for me. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It is rather unintuitive at first.<br><br>  Could you clarify what the problem was you had with swapping atoms? <br><br>   What is suppose to happen is that the first atom you select should start rotating. Then when you select a second atom (assuming it is adjacent to the 1st one) the two should just move into eachother's positions. Was this the case?<br><br>   Thanks again for taking the time to try it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Certainly is programmer graphics abound.  Gameplay maybe a bit complex?  I noticed when I got OK in a column, I could move stuff in and out of the column and OK didn't go away, this is weird.<br><br>Tutorial is a bit long winded, but I see why you've put all that text in there.<br><br>Really need to be able to click OK instead of pressing escape after vairous menu options like High Scores.<br><br>Your OK.wav sounds *just* like my pop noise from Easter Bonus but mixed with another sample to make the sliding noise ... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Is what Grey said about the columns keeping their OK status intentional or a bug ??? Certainly once you know thats the case it makes gameplay a whole lot easier.<br><br>On the rotate issue. It seems to me that after you have entered the menu the rotate seems to be scewed. Today its not stopping rotating completely, but after a trip to the menu and back the atoms just rotate 45 degrees anticlockwise and stop when selected. Different PC today mind, the one in my sig not the lappy I was using last night.<br><br>Also where it shows the difference it would be nice if it showed the actual difference eg a negative if there are too few. I wasted plenty of moves moving a smaller atom in only to find it incremented the difference the opposite way to what I was expecting. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The OK status is intentional, once a row is complete, it is complete for good, no matter what you do to it. In the new version, the area that displays the numbers will now simply be blacked out once completed.<br><br>2. I think the rotating issue has something to do with hokey method of calculating the animation speed based on the FPS. I've done away with it all together and have not been able to recreate the problem since.<br><br>3. There is a reason for the difference column to show an absolute difference rather than a positive or negative. In the later levels, some of the numbers in the goal column become unknown (?). I'm sure you would have discovered this had I made the game playable in the first place. <br><br>4. Alien, The ok.wav is one of the default Win XP sounds. Perhaps some new sounds will clarify wether moves are legal or illegal. Going back and playing Easter Bonus again, I see exactly what you mean.<br><br><br>   Thanks for taking your valuable time to try out my broken game. I'll be sure to put up a link to the new version once I have it uploaded. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
