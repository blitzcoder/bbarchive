I am looking for some help with my zelda style game, but I have been checking out MMORPG's and heard about UltimatebaseballOnline, which is going to be the first Sports mmorpg.  its pretty cool, I was thinking of other sports that could be done, and it would seem that football and basketball would be challenging because of the AI that is needed.  But one I think could be done is soccer.  The AI needed for a soccer game wouldnt be as complicated as other sports because the interaction isnt as complicated(when I say AI im referring to the program figuring out the appropriate interaction between players when theres a tackle or a pass or a steal etc...).  If possible I would like to put a team together to make a project and give this a shot.  Theres no gaurentee that we could get it done or even make any money with it, so if your looking to get rich quick this isnt for you.  Although if we get it that far and it does make us money that is cool too.  I think the project it self is very feesible, certainly the network code is there and with a max of 40 players connected to one game at a time, I think its very realistic that it could have little if any lag depending on what connections everyone has. Here is what I would forsee as what we would need for a team if you are interested please drop a line here on the forum, or feel free to discuss the possibility:<br><br>Team Leaders (3)<br><br>3 people who could also be involved with other parts of the project who would help coordinate the project.  They would keep everything organized and moving forward as well as work with any online promotion(websites etc...).  They would also be involved with any testing phases...<br><br>Main Programmers (3-4)<br><br>3-4 People to create a fast yet slick engine that can be adapted for detail( for those with a slower connection).  They would also need to be able to create the Front End Interface, menus etc...<br><br>Network Programmers (2)<br><br>2 People to work with the main programmers on the client side, and create a server side program.  They would need to develop a strategy for what would remain client side / what would be server side, and impliment it into action.<br><br>Graphics Designers (3-4)<br><br>3-4 people to design all the 2D menu graphics, and layouts, all 3d models, including players, stadiums, and the like, as well as creating logos and themes for the game.  Would not necessarily need any blitz experience, but Im sure it would be a bonus.<br><br>Sound Designers (2)<br><br>2 People to find or create all the sound effects needed for the game from music for the menus, to the beeps and blips, to the sounds on the field.<br><br><br><br>Now UBO has been a 3 year going on 4 project, and I know that most MMORPG's take longer than expected, but UBO started from scratch and has put a major focus on finding a publisher which has slowed down their bug improvement.  One of the advantages of Blitz(at least I think), is that with the power and ease of blitz you can create things alot quicker than starting an engine from scratch.  I think we could get something in the testing phase in well under a year....<br><br>Thoughts? Comments? Intersted, please reply to this message....<br><br>Rob <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

As for money, there is no money to back the project, this would be just like project plasma or any other one, something we work at, if we get it to the point where it can make money thats awesome if not well so be it.  <br><br>As for the comments above:<br><br>&gt;Ok... <br>&gt;<br>&gt;May I ask what you yourself are gonna do? :)<br><br>I would be happy to be a team leader and a main programmer, those are my strengths.<br><br>&gt;Surely you jest?! I can think of very few sports with AI &gt;*as* complicated! <br> <br>You forget its an mmorpg, meaning every player on the field is human controlled.  Compared to football where you have lineman basically wrestling and millions of tackle animations, or basketball where you have people pushing in the post and steals and dunks and lots of fancy things to figure out soccer is a little more basic in the fact that you only have a few ways to tackle and a few outcomes of a tackle...  Most of the outcomes are based on position which is determined by the players not by AI.  Since every player on the field is human controlled, its alot easier.<br><br>&gt;If you don't mind me saying, that's totally the wrong &gt;frame of mind to be in even before your project has &gt;started - I doubt you'll find many people interested in &gt;spending/wasting time on a project that might not see the &gt;light of day. <br><br>Is there ever a guarentee?  Im not saying we wont try to finish, but we might get half way into this and find that blitz isnt feesible for doing an mmorpg of this nature at a high enough speed to be a succesful game.  Its uncharted waters, we might find its not possible to do.<br><br>&gt;Erm... in football (I shall call it Soccer for now) &gt;there's 11 players per team, 2 teams, so that's 22.

Im not saying that there would always be 40 people logged in, although the idea is that you are playing the role of a coach or player, and there might be people who would want to be virtual coaches who watched from the sidelines etc....<br><br>On the contrary I have put some thought into it, but there is alot of unexplored territory here. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

(And no I'm not critisizing the size of the team you wanna set up since it's a MMO) But how in the world do you expect the proper people to join you? There is very few truely skilled programmers here that don't already have a project and even if they don't have one they are in most cases not going to join just anyone that has an "idea", my advice to you is get some skilled people you know together and deliver a playable techdemo (it realy doesn't take 15 peepz to realise that), then come back and post a job wanted add for the people you need...<br><br>You may want to ask yourself, how many online gamedev/modding projects you have "succesfully" ran before with teams of over 7 ACTIVE participants,if the answer isn't atleast one you might wanna think about a simpler game concept like maybe a basic online football game with player hosted servers and make your team requirements a bit more reasonable!<br><br>Don't take this as an insult, it's just good advice, good luck with it! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You could also have a 5 -a- side option to reduce the need for so many numbers - in fact I would start with 5-a-side first and if successful then move to the 11-a-side game.<br>The AI would be a cinch - how many footballers with an IQ over 25 do you know ? ;)<br>Seriously - the AI would be as complicated as any other sport - Football or Soccer as known in the USA is after all the ´Beautiful Game´ and this would have to be reflected in the gameplay -  But its certainly not an impossible task.<br><br>Don´t let the ´Merchants of Doom´ put you off totally You very sensible mapped out what you thought would be a requirement purely for discussion and suddenly you are deluged with - What are you gonna do ?
