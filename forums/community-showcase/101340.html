It is a game … of a sort. It’s a gamelike thing with quite a bit of random generation experimentation thrown in. In the final version the overall point is to solve a puzzle from the seemingly disparate sections of the game. The idea is that you would have to play the game a number of times to try to figure out the puzzle – the whole thing only lasts a few minutes.<br><br>So if you have a few minutes to spare, I’d be grateful if you could download it and have a play. In this test version, the puzzle isn’t available, all you can do is try to survive and get the best score you can.<br><br>It would be great if you could answer these questions:<br>1. What operating system are you using?<br>2. Did it run OK?<br>3. Did you get as far as a screen that asks for a password?<br>4. [EDIT: this question no longer relevant]<br>5. What score did you get?<br><br>Before anyone asks – it will be a free game. You may think I’m mad after you’ve played it but I’m not so mad as to imagine that people would hand over money for such a silly thing as this :)<br><br>I’m including some screenshots because I know nobody likes to download anything without seeing screenshots first. But it is tricky to represent it properly with a few images so please dowload and give it a go. It’s only 16MB.<br><br>Some screens are just a matter of clicking a button. More complicated parts of the game have their own help page – press p to pause the game and see instructions.<br><br>Written in Blitz3D and using Sprite Candy and Particle Candy.<br><br>It’s called ‘a delver dreams their own demise’. Er … it just is.<br><br>Reminder: PRESS P TO PAUSE THE GAME AND READ HELP<br><br>------------------------------------------------<br><br>Edit: 10.10.2013<br><br>link now to version 1.00<br><br>Testers still more than welcome - especially need feedback re Windows 8<br><br><a href="http://www.fizzhog.com/downloads/addtod_v1_00.zip" target="_blank">addtod_v1_00.zip</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
