(My dad would be completely stuffed!)<br><br>The selection of areas and tasks to complete were excellent, i felt like i'd had a real good sample of what the full game had to offer.<br><br>To be honest with you this wouldn't be the sort of game i would normally choose to buy. Personal preference is for more realistic gaming situations. I'd love to see a variation of this title, perhaps with a different graphical style (more realism ?), with tasks such as rescuing people from burning buildings, etc.<br><br>The gameplay was very similar to a model helicopter sim i played about a year ago for quite a while.<br>Your title is very entertaining and has a 'just one more go' element to it.<br><br>In summary i really like it, but not enough to buy it i'm afraid.<br>(But then i wouldn't take too much notice of my personal preferences since my current project involves sailing a three wheeled trolley around a car-park, each to their own eh ?).<br><br>cheers,<br><br>Funky Frank <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Thats a good thing you included more levels, i thought you should do that as well. And like previous poster i can also already tell you that more realism is probably cooler because the whole flying thing is much more spectacular when you get into it rather than feeling like youre in a cartoon. Cos in cartoons everythings possibly, not if its realistic, then it looks "wow". BUT.... i KNOW how much more times it takes to make realistic art, esp. textures and esp. if you aren't photosourcing by yourself, etc. Would need much much more memory as well i asume. Still, consider it. Make a prototype with full art if you want, for AA2, and have me test it :)<br><br>Otherwise as i said previously, neat idea. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The graphics are good but nothing "wow!" about them, IMO. The music in the demo, too, is good but not very inspiring to me.<br><br>I found the controls a little tricky to get used to (I don't play FPS games) and, as has already been said, I think this aspect alone would put off some players; especially casual gamers.<br><br>Some specific nit-picking:<br>- The triangle mouse cursor used in the front end tends to get in the way when trying to choose a new screen res, etc.<br>- The screen showing the game's controls is somewhat obscured by the info bubble/cloud thing. This may not happen in resolutions above 800x600, I don't know.<br>- After finishing a level, there's a big "buy now" button in the corner, but no mouse cursor to click on it with.<br>- The level info displayed at the start of each level is a bit weedy, IMO. I'd have liked to have seen a bigger, fun-er font used. The same applies to the name input routine. This also has a too short a repeat delay period, I think - it's easy to accidentally type 2 or more same characters.<br><br>That all sounds pretty negative, I guess but, on the whole, AA is a very good, polished game. Well done. :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Dont make it like that game plobb, that was so slow you could fall asleep, altho everything else was good about it. I assume you are not insane and will leave an option to choose between "Slow motha#####r mode" and "l337 g4m3rz mode" ? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'm going to try it out like this at any rate and see what the response is.  Overall people have all complained that it's too hard to control and that's mostly because it's pretty fast.  I don't think the new one is too slow but we'll see.<br><br>The biggest issue is that right now I've just got done readjusting the bonus times for the levels because of course it now takes longer to beat them.  If I go and add two modes then I need two sets of bonus times etc...  If I start digging into it that much then I'm more than tempted to add it to the rewrite along with multiplayer and maybe some other stuff.  At this point I'm still trying to get the original material to be enjoyable by the majority of people. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Really deserves commercial success.<br>Perhaps could gain wider appeal by changing the central character to somthing more "animated" - he is a bit bland and doesn't have many animated or vocal reactions.<br>Having some crazy rabbit or weird alien type character could perhaps fit in more with the cartoon like environment which is very impressive. Give him some funny animations when things go wrong etc - make him shout at you when you collide etc. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
