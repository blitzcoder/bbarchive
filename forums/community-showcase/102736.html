VI served us well, especially in the last week.  But, time to move on....<br><br>I have just updated my upload from earlier on.<br><br><b>@BlitzSupport</b>, I read your last post, but I think you downloaded the previous version just before I uploaded this new one.  Indeed the dwarves are negatively coloured, they have been configured this way with my simple dxEntityNegative command.  Have you noticed even with this shader function that it will get darker when you shine a light on it - looks really weird.  I quite like it.<br><br>Anyway, I have made quite a few modifications to the vertex and pixel shaders.  I have found bugs that I hadn't discovered before - so for me I have made some progress in getting it back together but correctly this time.  I haven't finished yet, but feel that I am on the right track.<br><br>Ok, you should notice an increase in speed using the hw shaders in the maze.bb.  Please note that in the dx9 version that the walls are rendered using the directx 9 fixed function pipeline, but the dwarves are rendered using the hardwired shaders.  Since the dwarves have been set to negative colour, and a negative effect is not available in direct9's ffp, hardwired will automatically switch to the hw shaders.  This is why you have two different lighting effects in the render - the walls will be rendered using the directx9 techinique of spotlighted textures.  However the dwarves are rendered using my spotlight technique found in the pixel shader.  This was done deliberatly to show the difference.  You will notice this difference especially when you see a dwarf and it will become apparent.  This is a good demonstration of how hardwired can easily switch beween render modes in directx 9.  The render mode <i>(fixed function pipeline/hardwired shaders/user-created shaders)</i> will completely fall to the choice of the programmer in the end - he/she will have complete control on how the renderer should proceed.  For the moment, however I still of course have a few bugs to iron out.  But I'm getting there...<br><br>In this dx11 version of maze.bb, everything is of course rendered using my shaders, because directx11 is not equipped with it's own default shaders.  I have never understood that actually, directx11 is more recent than dx9.  It is without a doubt more powerful than dx9, but has less friendliness so to speak.  Dx11 provides you with raw power, but no alternative.  Still, that's my problem I guess more than yours.  I guess I just like moaning :)<br><br>Shaders are evil, by the way for anyone that doesn't know them well.  For good and fast gfx manipulation using the techiniques of today one cannot do without them- no doubt about it.  But they are evil - I mean they are so evil they probably have a poster of emperor Palpatine on their bedroom wall.  Why do I not like them??  Because all of their 'constants' (global variables) that have to be perfectly aligned, sometimes including padding depending on the variable.  I will explain much more on how to use shaders as I release more and more shader commands so you will be able to make and use your own, if you dare.  But they are not easy in any case.  I'm still learning a lot about them, and shaders are definatly the way to go.  But, boy aren't they tough to program perfectly...<br><br>For info, I have now put back all the quaternion and matrix functions that I had added - these functions were not in any way upsetting the renderer.<br><br><a href="http://chipmunkplayer.free.fr/release.zip" target="_blank"><b>Hardwired userlib</b></a>  / <a href="http://chipmunkplayer.free.fr/command_list.html" target="_blank"><i>Command list here</i></a> / <a href="http://chipmunkplayer.free.fr/Hardwired_commands.xlsx" target="_blank"><i>List in Excel format</i></a> / <a href="http://chipmunkplayer.free.fr/libvlc.zip" target="_blank"><i>Libvlc dll's here</i></a><br><br> <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&amp;business=phoebe8%40free%2efr&amp;lc=GB&amp;item_name=Blitz%20Hardwired&amp;currency_code=EUR&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_SM%2egif%3aNonHosted" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_GB/i/btn/btn_donate_SM.gif"></a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I do have my own opinion about all this though I try not to express it too strongly.  Although of course you all are free to express your opinion when and how you want, and some opinions I agree with, I feel I cannot do such as I would like to take some kind of responsability in all this.  This mainly because these threads exist for my project at the end of the day.  I would like not have to 'take sides'.  But I would equally like to quosh 'bickering' that could get out of hand.  I feel I am forced to react, but I do not wish to - if it was my wish I would remain neutral (more or less).<br><br>All I ask is that we all try to work on this very same principal, getting hardwired done.  I think the best way to do this, if it really is worth something to you in the long-run, is just to let me get on with it in the manner of my choosing.  It is tough enough as it is.  I have my work, my family life and responsabilities like everyone else.  On top of this, I have this wonderful obsession that I have been working on since october 2013.  I think about it a lot, I read a lot - I do research on the net in the best way to resolve a problem.  In brief, I do not need too many outside factors to complicate things further.<br><br>I really do appreciate suggestions, comments and even praise (good for ego).  But all this for the sake of constructiveness, please.  But I cannot pander to personal requests all the time, I try to go with the flow of my code as much as I can, and I cannot cut off just like that.  You can always ask, but ONCE is enough.  I do read every post in the threads with great interest, and I have a memory too.  So, asking again and again just becomes very rude.  So please, patience, I am doing what I can.  If it's not good enough or I'm not going fast enough, or if I'm not doing what you insist upon I would suggest that you keep that to yourself, or try making a 3d engine yourself, or just look elsewhere.  I feel that I have contributed very often, when I can, to the forum with news, responses, and updates.  But always with the same goal in mind.  I don't think you can complain too much about my dedication to this all.  So please respect this fact, and help me rather than hinder.  This is what I am principally looking for.  I am not stopping and would not wish to stop anyone from expressing his/her opinion, but when it starts to feel as though I'm back at school it gets a bit hard to deal with.<br><br>I appreciate even more than the above any bug-reports (with examples helps me too) for my releases.  Hardwired is a work in progress, and its source code is huge not to mention the fact that the whole project is just incredibly ambitious.  There are going to be bugs, and things I've just forgot to put in.  I need help, I think this forum is great in helping me along with the growth of hardwired and I would like to thank you all for the support you have given me up until now.  So please, let us as much a possible keep to the same objective, getting HW as complete as possible.  I'm counting on your help, but as much as I'm counting on your patience.<br><br>Hope I've been clear about how I feel, and I haven't 'vexed' anyone in the process.  But if I have, so be it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It is definatly doable, but probably way above my head.  I'd have to get into parsing, error checking, converting into ASM, a lot of new factors to consider.  At the same time these 'functions' would have to be compiled by the blitz compliler, so would not be part of a dll userlib.  A userlib could eventually process a script but the compilation of these functions using this method would have to be made during runtime, like with how HLSL executes - meaning that a shader function would still remain separate from the main program code and you couldn't incorporate them together in the same script.  But theoretically it's a very enticing idea...<br><br><div class="quote"> I thought it was interesting that you said shaders were really hard to do,  <br></div><br><br>For me the shaders themselves are not particularly difficult.  They are fairly similar in construction to c++ even.  It's preparing/sending the constant table that for me is a bit of a nightmare.  Since hlsl relies on 16-byte registers, you have to align all constants to these register sets - meaning sometimes you have to pad out some things. Arrays too have to be padded out, they are not packed.  A real headache sometimes, cos if you forget this 16-byte rule, you get weird results from the shader in question.  A few weeks ago I even managed to upset my gfx adapter by badly aligning my constants and it started drawing random stuff all over my screen, even when my compiler test had finished running and I was working on other windows - freaky!  I had to even reset my pc to get any sense out of it.  Still I battle on.  I think that when I do get to the stage where I am including shader support on hardwired I will try to get some kind on manager going at the same time that will take care of this alignment automatically.  Well, if it is possible.  I would like to keep hardwired as friendly and accessible to the user without costing it much performance. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'm taking a break from shaders, so nothing new on that front.  I need a break from it to reflect a bit, in the meantime I am moving on to other parts of hardwired that need servicing.<br><br>Today, there are two new functions.  Don't hold your breath though...<br><br><b>dxPrint(string$)</b> - The old tried and trusted command - if you don't know how to use this one where have you been for the last 30 years.  One of the oldest basic commands around.  Worked well for its time but the bb version isn't recommended (see below for why)<br><b>dxWrite%(string$)</b> - Almost the same as dxPrint but does not start a new line.<br><br>Okay, these commands seem like simple additions, and from your point of view they probably are.  But for me, not at all.  I'll explain, it's all to do with the directx and, if you like to a certain extent even the gfx adapter architecture.<br><br>According the blitz3d/+ rules, Print/Write will render text directly to the frontbuffer.  This makes all the difference, the issue is all about memory access.  The frontbuffer, of course is the current rendered image, which is being shown on the screen.  This image has exclusive access by the gfx adapter once this data has been sent by the pc's motherboard. The backbuffer, is a buffer that is not linked currently with the screen, so the access is available to the cpu.  According to the rules of directx 9, accessing the frontbuffer directly is a very slow procedure.  The cpu has to wait between frames when the screen is not drawing (the 'vertical blank') to have the 'right' to retrieve any data.  It's even written in the official <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb174388(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank">microsoft documentation</a> that it's not a great practice to perfom using the frontbuffer because of it's performance.<br><br>Strangely enough, directx 7 seems to achieve a better frontbuffer access that dx9.  I haven't quite understood how, but perhaps it uses 'tricks' rather that accessing the gpu's data.  One trick would be to keep a 'copy' of the frontbuffer each time the front and back buffers are flipped.<br><br>With directx, one cannot write directly to the frontbuffer like you can to the backbuffer.  All you can do to the frontbuffer basically read its contents (like I said above - slow!!), and when ready send the backbuffer to replace it using a flip.  So, printing becomes much more complicated than a 'simple' text command.  For anyone interested, I have detailed the way I have for the moment decided to adopt in order to print text to the frontbuffer, so it gives the same kind of results as in the blitz equivalent.<br><br>1.  Save a copy of the whole of the back buffer into a temporary buffer<br>2.  Save a copy of the whole of the front buffer  into a temporary buffer<br>3.  Copy the saved front buffer to the backbuffer.  In a dxPrint command, if the following text will fall 'below' the height of the screen, this copy of the front buffer will begin lower than coordinates (0,0), so to 'scroll' to screen up; as in a classic Print command<br>4.  If there is a scroll in progress clear the very bottom part of the backbuffer with the colour used in dxClsColor command, taking its height from the amount of pixels the screen will be scrolled up.<br>5.  Draw the text onto the backbuffer and update the 'pen' coodinates depending on font size, and the string width/height.<br>6.  Flip the screen so that the new 'frontbuffer' comes into view.<br>7.  Recopy the saved version of the backbuffer back to the backbuffer.<br>8.  Free up memory used by saved version of front buffer<br>9.  Free up memory used by saved version of back buffer<br><br>This is very long-winded (a bit like this post :D), it is slow, and quite frankly I'm not proud of it.  The code is good, should be bug-less (I've said that before ;D), but dxPrint and dxWrite are not recommended for people that wish a fluid performance from thier games/apps.  I cannot do much more than this.  This is not due to my own programming limits, but more the directx/machine limits.  We are not generally supposed to directly access the frontbuffer.  You can, but it is slow.  In any case, for good general programming you do not need to access the frontbuffer.  It is messy, ugly and quite unecessary for modern programming (this is my personal opinion b4 anyone shoots me down ;D).<br><br>Despite the fact that the frontbuffer render of a print command is not great, I still personally have a deep fondness for the command itself.  It is probably the first ever command I used on a BBC micro so many years ago.  Who can forget the classic first programs such as<br><br><textarea class=codebox name="code" wrap=OFF readonly="true" rows="15" cols="80">
10 PRINT "hello"
20 GOTO 10</textarea><br><br>,for example?  I guess that the Print command makes me a little nostalgic.  Nethertheless, this hardwired version was much trickier than meets the eye.  I do not think that many people will need to use it any way, most use the text commands that write to the back buffer whatever the compiler.  But I had to put it in so to continue to remain faithful to the b3d/b+ command list.  So here we are, dxPrint and dxWrite in all their 'beauty'.<br><br>I will say this much, I do use Print quite a lot when I'm debugging my blitz programs.<br><br><b>Please note</b> -  These two commands do not currently work in the dx11 mode of hardwired...<br><br><a href="http://chipmunkplayer.free.fr/release.zip" target="_blank"><b>Hardwired userlib</b></a>  / <a href="http://chipmunkplayer.free.fr/command_list.html" target="_blank"><i>Command list here</i></a> / <a href="http://chipmunkplayer.free.fr/Hardwired_commands.xlsx" target="_blank"><i>List in Excel format</i></a> / <a href="http://chipmunkplayer.free.fr/libvlc.zip" target="_blank"><i>Libvlc dll's here</i></a><br><br> <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&amp;business=phoebe8%40free%2efr&amp;lc=GB&amp;item_name=Blitz%20Hardwired&amp;currency_code=EUR&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_SM%2egif%3aNonHosted" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_GB/i/btn/btn_donate_SM.gif"></a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This is because I do not want lots of different versions out that could lose me credibility as HW's developer.  I wish to assume full responsability for its growth and eventual success.  I am as proud as much as amazed of how far I've got with it so far.  This is my baby, I am becoming more and more confident that HW will reach completion.  I wish to take full credit for this and, if it does end up full of bugs and gives bad performance <i>(rest asseured this is not a future I forsee but who knows?  I must stay with my feet firmly on the ground at the same time)</i> I will take the flak for it.  It's a pride/reputation thing.  I have put hundreds of hours into HW, and will no doubt put hundreds more in.  If I have decided to give this away it it because I do not want money to be my driving force.  I really do realise I could make a considerable amount of money with a completed project, and it's not as though I don't need money (donations always welcome, but no way obligatory).  But if I concentrate just on 'making a buck' and not simply my passion for blitz and the idea that people could make blitz relive with a nice new sheen, well I think the end result would not be so good and of course I would not have so much support.  But I <b>will</b> get something out of it if it isn't money - the satisfaction of completing and publishing a project that people use, and my name &amp; reputation out on the developer market too.  Not too bad a protfolio at the end of the day, a working 3d engine.  I'd love to get myself into this industry as a c++ developer, but with no qualifications and 40 years on the clock I would need something to convince potential employers.  And rest assured, I am keeping my eye closely peeled for the release of dx12.  As soon as it does, you can expect a dx12 version of HW in a relatively short time.  So HW should, if I'm not biting off more than I can chew, finish by becoming reputable and one of the top choices in free 3d-engines.  I will however ask for my name to be credited for any use on freeware products, and insist on a credit for any commercial releases that use hardwired.<br><br>So, no source, but on the other hand I will probably end up releasing an SDK in the not too distant future... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Come on GuyFawkes, don't you see that constantly repeating <b>'i'm ignoring this guy, that one and now you too'</b> every time is not doing anyone any favors?  I think that everyone is smart enough to understand that the first time, and furthermore they do not really need to know.  It's not as though they are going to mark it up on their calander <i>'the day GuyFawkes decided to ignore me'</i> or some such thing.  Everyone will just carry on like normal, I think I speak for everyone by saying that they will get over it.  So please stop with this 'I'm ignoring you' stuff, because IMHO it is not doing you any favours credibility wise.  I mean, if you could virtually pull someone's pig-tails or give them a virtual 'dead-arm' on the forum, would you have done that too?  You do not realise that these kind of comments are really putting out negative vibes.  If in some post or other someone disagrees with you, why not try to deal with it?  I do not wish to condescend, but it may already be too late anyway.  We all have different opinions, we all have to learn to respect them, and at the same time try to understand other peoples poin't of view.  No one will agree with the others 100% of the time.<br><br>Look GF, I really don't want to end up like this, but if this continues I'm quitting.  Not Hardwired, of course - I am getting very far with it and plan to carry on as far as I can.  But I will just abandon the forum - I have very much liked it up until now, I have had some priceless feedback, but now it seems the threads are becoming frayed.  I'll just find another forum, that's all.  These bad vibes are not doing anyone any good - I'm sick of the word 'Trolls' coming up from time to time, the bickering and the ignoring.  All this for me is just poisoning the threads.  If you cannot put your differences behind you GF, please just ignore these threads.<br><br>Now if this isn't clear, I don't know what is - I've really tried to be tactful about this up until now, for I didn't want to offend Guy Fawkes especially.  But I think I have no choice.  Desperate mesures for desperate times.<br><br>@Rick Nasher<br><div class="quote"> Perhaps a good idea to put up a FAQ or Wiki for this to refer to? <br></div><br>I do very much like your idea, in my opinion it would help clarify certain things about hardwired.  Problem is I have so many things to do that I can't do that myself yet.  I would eventually like to ask someone to help me write up a page, but I feel it would be incorrect to ask someone to do it for me - it is not my place to 'recruit' anyone.  And if someone, anyone proposed to help me put this together <i>(to which I would probably accept with open arms)</i> it is foreseeable that someone else would not be in agreement - almost as in a jealous sulk.  It may be my imagination, but this is the kind of mentality I am feeling of the forum at the moment.  So, I'm sorry I would have to say no also to anyone proposing to help me with a FAQ - mainly because I would like to avoid even more reason to what I would call a squabble.<br><br>I think we are seriously getting off the rails with this thread.  I am wasting a lot of my time now with pointless banalities that get us nowhere but at the same time are sending some away from the forum already.  I am trying to keep some order in this up until now and keep the discussion light-hearted and constructive.  But it seems to be that as time goes on, I'm losing the battle.  I'm sick of wasting my time with all this... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I have spent the last few days restructuring and optimising my code once again; you should notice speed improvements in both the rendertime and the load time when you run a compiled bb.  Things are generally more efficient, and much tidier code-wise for me.<br><br>For info, I think that this release will mainly interest <b>VirtLands</b>, and anyone with a touchscreen.  I have spent relatively little time today on creating a few touchscreen commands <i>(test program available - touchscreen_test.bb)</i>....<br><br>Windows covers a large range of touchscreen activity, the functions I have added to hardwired are just a portion is what the windows functions are capable of.  If I can get touchscreen access working I will also add functions to be able to program gestures and to detect them.  Pretty cool I think.<br><br><b>dxTouchscreenTouched%()</b> - Returns true if screen has been touched since the last time <b>dxTouchscreenTouched</b> was called<br><b>dxTouchscreenXPos#()</b> - Returns the x position of where the screen was last touched (measured in hundreths of physical screen coordinates)<br><b>dxTouchscreenYPos#()</b> - Returns the y position of where the screen was last touched (measured in hundreths of physical screen coordinates)<br><b>dxTouchscreenWidth%()</b> - Returns the width of the digit where the screen was last touched (measured in hundreths of physical screen coordinates)<br><b>dxTouchscreenHeight%()</b> - Returns the height of the digit where the screen was last touched (measured in hundreths of physical screen coordinates)<br><b>dxTouchscreenTime%()</b> - Returns the system time of the last touch event caught by hardwired (measured in millisecs)<br><br><b>Please note:</b>I am <b><u>completely</b></u> blind for these commands, because I do not have a touchscreen myself.  I cannot test these commands, but if I have followed the logic of the MS docs, my new commands should work.<br><br>So, <b>VirtLands</b>, please confirm that this works or not for I have no way of knowing.  I hope it does, but if it doesn't I, for the moment am not going to spend much time on getting it working.  I am just curious to know if I can get it to work or not.  Touchscreen functions are not my priority for the moment, but if I do manage to access these windows functions I will include this in hardwired.  I guess I just basically wanted to know for the fun of it, but it would be a great addition in any case.  It would add to blitz's accesibility.<br><br><b>Small but important note:</b>  All touchscreen commands will only work on windows created by hardwired.  The functions will be useless to classic blitz windows.  It is also to note that these functions will <b>NOT</b> crash for pc's not possessing touchscreens, these functions will just return zero.<br><br><a href="http://chipmunkplayer.free.fr/release.zip" target="_blank"><b>Hardwired userlib</b></a>  / <a href="http://chipmunkplayer.free.fr/command_list.html" target="_blank"><i>Command list here</i></a> / <a href="http://chipmunkplayer.free.fr/Hardwired_commands.xlsx" target="_blank"><i>List in Excel format</i></a> / <a href="http://chipmunkplayer.free.fr/libvlc.zip" target="_blank"><i>Libvlc dll's here</i></a><br><br> <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&amp;business=phoebe8%40free%2efr&amp;lc=GB&amp;item_name=Blitz%20Hardwired&amp;currency_code=EUR&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_SM%2egif%3aNonHosted" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_GB/i/btn/btn_donate_SM.gif"></a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It details what the author requires of the user, the rights of the author as far as intellectual property stands, and a legal disclaimer to avoid any confusion.<br><br>I don't think it has to have on official name, 'stamped' by a recognised body as such.  I may be wrong here, I am of course NOT a legal professional - but I think we all figured that one out.  This is all new ground to me, but I don't think we need to get too heavy when it's concerning free software at the end of the day.  Just as long as the license is there and is clear, it should be enough to put minds at rest..... or at least I hope so...  If you think I do need to delve futher to avoid any potential legal traps for either myself or the end-user please explain.  I won't hide the fact to being a little more than foggy on all this.

Since the point of keeping the source closed was quality and IP and <i>auteur</i> control, there's no point handing out a licence to people to use this potentially-broken alpha version in production code and sully your good name!

So I am fairly flexible when it comes to amendments.  I will however remain unflexible about no one modifing my work, or taking credit for it, or again them having to credit me for any published commercial work.

Since the point of keeping the source closed was quality and IP and auteur control, there's no point handing out a licence to people to use this potentially-broken alpha version in production code and sully your good name! I would from that perspective be concerned about a licence that offers any warranty at all. Opening yourself up to a lot there if a virus infects it during download.)<br> <br></div><br><br>After a bit of thought I do like what Yasha is getting at.  Hardwired <b>is</b> still very much in production after all, it is not ready for an official release- not even close.  So there isn't really any point of being hasty for a license which could open me up for more liability than I wish for - not good.  So I think what I have done so far is good, to lay the ground for an eventual license.  I think I will leave the license blank for the moment, and when a official release is made, then I will release a license at the same time.  Gives me good time to do the research necessary to get a license up and ready that suits hardwired and it's requirements.... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You have a lot of people interested in your engine that are helping you test it.  Some may be testing it by building projects that use your engine in the anticipation of its final release.  Some are putting a lot of effort into using your engine.  Many months from now when an official release is made and the license is finally made public, some may not like the license and be quite upset with the amount of time they have put into supporting your engine, that they might not have otherwise supported had the license been made available early on.  Some may find themselves putting in a lot of work for nothing only to have to switch to another engine due to license issues.<br><br>Just avoid open source licenses since it is a closed source project.  Also, it is best not to steal a license from another project.  Some people pay thousands of dollars to have a lawyer draw up a license and the text of licenses are protected by copyright laws.  If you swipe a license, there is a good chance you may get nailed at some point an receive a C&amp;D or be brought into court looking for damages, ie., money for each copy of your software that was distributed, whether it was free or not. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Before declaring it "open source" publically (I made "available" in my Subversion repo 2 years ago) I was frightened of people renaming our project, having more time than me and a coding buddy and finishing something off I started over 10 years ago. But hey - if they really achieve this, I can play theirs and see how they do things - and if I release something, I can call our little game "the original" :p.<br><br>Another nice thing to know: While nobody asked for the code, many asked for the assets I created. They asked if they get the permission to use it because they write something similar or for another target (browser game) - but all of them (as I know) asked BEFORE. Why? They all there hobbyist developers like we are.

Sorry, I feel a bit of a dunce now, I shoud have got that earlier.  Ooops.<br><br><b>@RemiD</b> Thankyou for the kind words, my good man<br><br><b>@GuyFawkes</b>, I'm perfectly okay on how you wish to use my dll, just as long as the dll itself isn't modified, including its filename.  I originally created Hardwired for use as an extension to Blitz+/3D, but I completely understand it is adaptable to other languages/compilers.  I have no problem with this, whatever makes you confortable.  As for your PureBasic woes, you're on your own there, I have no idea what makes it tick.<br><br><b>@Virtlands</b>, thanks for the license link, I will check it out - I have a bit of free time today to look into all this and welcome suggestions with open arms.  Legal stuff is not my fort.<br><br>As for the touch commands, I did indeed use <b>RegisterTouchWindow</b> and <b>GetTouchInputInfo</b>.  I even added the necessary event switch to detect this kind of input, but no joy.  I guess I must have missed something out somewhere.  Thanks for trying anyway - like I said this is not my priority for the moment, but I will come back to it at some point.<br><br>Concerning double precision floats - for info, directx does not even deal with double floating point numbers, and I believe this is the case even for the gfx adapter's abilities.  This limit is for the moment 32-bit floats for numbers.  I included these functions because you may wish for the processor to store/calculate 64-bit floats and convert them to normal floats when needed.<br><br>The processor can deal with 80-bit numbers and with some effort can even do 128-bit numbers.  I may include functions for these, I don't know yet.<br><br><a href="https://gmplib.org/" target="_blank">Here's a link</a> to an interesting library that deals with variable sized floaters that may interest you - looks cool....<br><br><b>@MadJack</b><br><div class="quote"> <br>Running test10d.bb (the jumping dwarfs), the dwarfs render correctly with debug enabled but are solid black in non-debug mode (ran in windowed mode).<br> <br></div><br>What a very strange bug.  I have already had problems in the past between debug and release mode and things change.  I'll look into this weird phenomenon.  Cheers<br><br><b>@all</b> I'm currently working on the user-created shader part of hardwired and have got most of the constants structures sorted out already.  Perhaps no release for the next few days but with a bit of luck by the weekend people will be able at last to use thier own vertex and pixel shaders in blitz.  Fingers crossed, but the code is looking good so far... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The new functions/commands below are all about writing to them.  Shader constants, as some will already know are global variables used by vertex and pixel shaders.  These global variables do not change for all vertices processed by the vertex shader and all pixels processed by a pixel shader during the render of a 3d object.  This is why they are commonly called constants.<br><br>To be able to prepare and manipulate these constants is a vital part of shader programming.  Along with the vertex and texture information given by an entity when being sent to a shader, these global variables make up what is needed in order to achieve a wide scope of different effects and styles.<br><br>I will go into more detail about shader programming as time goes on, for the moment this will be easier for those who already have experience in HLSL.  I will also add other functions as time goes by....<br><br>An example of the usage of these functions in provided in shadertest.bb<br><br><b>dxAddShaderConstant%(shader%,constant$,type%,flags%)</b> : This function will record/map a 'constant' taken from a shader script.  To be able to access a constant it is first necessary to inform hardwired of its existence.  So, after loading a shader into memory, if you wish to be able change a contant's value, you will need to use this function to be able to map the constant's memory address.  You only need to 'assign' a constant to a shader once per constant, and you do not need to assign all constants found within a shader if you do not wish to - just the ones you need.<br><br><b><u>Parameters</b></u><br>shader - handle of shader returned by <b>dxCreateVertexShader</b> or <b>dxCreatePixelShader</b><br><br><b>constant$</b> - name of the constant to assign, the name of the constant is found in the HLSL shader script.  Please note - the parameter is case-sensitive, please use exactly the same name as in the HLSL script.  These constants are found in the cbuffer structure of the HLSL script, most of the time at the beginning of the script.<br><br><b>type</b> - the variable's type - this will inform hardwired on how to treat this variable.  Below if a list of each type and its function....<br><br>		<b><u>MANUAL TYPES</b></u><br>		1 = <i>float type</i> - Define this constant as a float and you will be able to change the value of this float with the <b>dxSetFloatShader</b> command between frames to any float value<br>		2 = <i>float2 type</i> - Define this constant as a float2 and you will be able to change the value of a constant containing a group of two float variables with the <b>dxSetFloat2Shader</b> command between frames to any float value<br>		3 = <i>float3 type</i> - Define this constant as a float3 and you will be able to change the value of a constant containing a group of three float variables with the <b>dxSetFloat3Shader</b> command between frames to any float value<br>		4 = <i>float4 type</i> - Define this constant as a float4 and you will be able to change the value of a constant containing a group of four float variables with the <b>dxSetFloat2Shader</b> command between frames to any float value<br>		5 = <i>int type</i> - Define this constant as a int and you will be able to change the value of this int with the <b>dxSetIntShader</b> command between frames to any int value<br>		6 = <i>int2 type</i> - Define this constant as a int2 and you will be able to change the value of a constant containing two int values with the <b>dxSetInt2Shader</b> command between frames to any int value<br>		7 = <i>int3 type</i> - Define this constant as a int3 and you will be able to change the value of a constant containing three int values with the <b>dxSetInt3Shader</b> command between frames to any int value<br>		8 = <i>int4 type</i> - Define this constant as a int4 and you will be able to change the value of a constant containing four int values with the <b>dxSetInt4Shader</b> command between frames to any int value<br>		9 = <i>bool type</i> - Define this constant as a bool and you will be able to change the value of this float with the <b>dxSetBoolShader</b> command between frames to any boolean value<br>		10 = <i>matrix type</i> - Define this constant as a matrix and you will be able to change the value of this float with the <b>dxSetMatrixShader</b> <i>(I have not yet created this command)</i> command between frames to any float value<br><br>		<b><u>AUTOMATIC TYPES</b></u><br>		11 = <i>entity matrix type</i> - Signals hardwired to automatically set this constant to the matrix value holding the entity's position, rotation and scalar value that the shader is assigned to.  This constant will be updated by the hardwired renderer.<br>		12 = <i>projection matrix</i> - Signals hardwired to automatically set this constant to the projection matrix, this matrix hold the information about the currently used camera and is used to convert coordinates for rendering.<br>		13 = <i>view matrix</i> signals hardwired to automatically set this constant to the view matrix, this matrix is used to convert between 3d projection coordinates and 2d screen coordinates.<br>		14 = <i>entity projection view matrix</i> - the values of the entity matrix multiplied by the projection matrix and the view matrix<br>		15 = <i>entity proection matrix</i> - the values of the entity matrix multiplied by the projection matrix<br>		16= <i>entity view matrix</i> - the values of the entity matrix multiplied by the view matrix<br>		17= <i>view projection matrix</i> - the values of the view matrix multiplied by the projection matrix<br>		18 to 25 = <i>light n1 to 8's matrix</i> - signals hardwired to set the constant to the light's matrix (holding it's position and rotational values).  In the hardwired renderer, light n1 corresponds to the closest light to the currently used camera, n2 in the next closest and so on.<br>		26 to 33 = <i>light n1 to 8's position</i>  - signals hardwired to set the constant to the light's positional values, this is a 3 float constant,a float for each x,y and z.<br>		34 to 41 = <i>light n1 to 8's direction</i> - signals hardwired to set the constant to the light's directional values, this is a 3 float constant,a float for each x,y and z.<br><br><b>flags</b> - <br>1 = <i>Transpose</i> - When applicable, this flag will transpose a value before writing to the shader constant<br>2 = <i>Inverse</i> - When applicable, this flag will inverse a value before writing to the shader constant<br>4 = <i>Normalise</i> - When applicable, this flag will normalise a value before writing to the shader constant<br>8 = <i>No position</i> - When applicable, will signal hardwired not to send positional information to the shader<br>16= <i>No rotation</i> - When applicable, will signal hardwired not to send rotational information to the shader<br>32= <i>No scale</i> - When applicable, will signal hardwired not to send scalar information to the shader<br><br><b>Note: These flags can be OR'ed</b><br><br><br><b>dxAddShaderConstant</b> will return, if succesful the index number of the assigned constant.  If not successful, it will return a 0 (for example if you do not respect the case of a constant string value, hardwired will not find what you are looking for and reject the function request).<br><br><b>dxCountShaderConstants%(shader%)</b> - Returns the current amount of constants that have been assigned<br><b>dxGetShaderConstantClass$(shader%,index%)</b> - Return's a string containing the type description of a constant assigned using <b>dxAddShaderConstant</b><br><b>dxGetShaderConstantType%(shader%,index%)</b> -  Return's the type of a constant assigned as set with <b>dxAddShaderConstant</b><br><b>dxSetShaderConstantType(shader%,index%,type%)</b> - Change a constant type to chosen type<br><b>dxGetShaderConstantFlags%(shader%,index%)</b> - Get a constant's current flag status<br><b>dxSetShaderConstantFlags(shader%,index%,flags%)</b> - Change a constant's flag<br><b>dSetIntShader(shader%,index%,value%)</b> - This is the command for manually changing an int constant.<br><b>dxSetBoolShader(shader%,index%,value%)</b> - This is the command for manually changing an bool constant (true/false).<br><b>dxSetFloatShader(shader%,index%,value#)</b> - This is the command for manually changing an float constant.<br><b>dxSetShaderConstantEntity(shader%,index%,entity%)</b> - Use this command to set a constant to use the matrix of any entity other than the entity that is linked to the shader in question.<br><b>dxGetShaderConstantEntity%(shader%,index%)</b> - Retrieve the handle of the entity set using <b>dxSetShaderConstantEntity</b><br><br><br>All this is a lot to take in, I'll admit.  And I probably haven't explained it very well.  That's one reason why I've done a quick demo, please check out both shadertest.bb and shaders\color_shader.txt, which is the shader used in the demo.  You may understand better looking at both codes to see the link that these above functions give.<br><br>These constant functions, and the ones I have yet to add, will become a <b>very</b> important part of the shader manipulation process used in hardwired.  A lot of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhrBDcQq2DM" target="_blank">headway</a> is being made in the way of shader control.  I have yet to add certain things, such as vertex declarations so for the moment shaders will only recognise the default blitz vertex structure.

As time has been progressing I have obviously noticed that it is becoming less and less clear to keep track of all commands.  So I have no update for hardwired today, but on the other hand I have uploaded my first draft of the hardwired help files.  These help files are only compatible with the Blitz3d help system for the moment, the B+ version will come later.  Just decompress this zip file to your Blitz3d folder.  You may wish to back up the original folder first, and since I haven't quite yet finished these help files, I would recommend backing it up.<br><br>In order to work, these help files need to be written into the existing blitz3d's help folder (not an empty folder named 'help'), this is why I recommend backing it up, and not just simply renaming the existing folder.<br><br>When my help files are complete I may issue them with a little installer that backs up the b3d help files.  For these help files I will release updates from time to time of course, as Hardwired progresses...<br><br>For the moment, the hardwired commands will not appear in the left-hand side of B3D's help system (categories/A-Z) - I should get that part finished tomorrow.  For now B3D's help system should return a help page corresponding to a hardwired command when you hit F1, as you do with the classic B3D commands.  All original B3D commands work like normal, I have not changed these help files in any way....<br><br>The original blitz's example files have been also converted to their HW equivalents.  However, the conversion I used was automatically done by a program I created.  The program did NOT take function defaults into account.  So if an example does not work right away, it is only because some commands may be missing parameters that B3D uses as defaults.  Simply add these params as their default values to the bb code and all should work fine.<br><br><a href="http://chipmunkplayer.free.fr/hardwired_help.zip" target="_blank"><i>Hardwired help files</i></a><br><br><a href="http://chipmunkplayer.free.fr/release.zip" target="_blank"><b>Hardwired userlib</b></a>  / <a href="http://chipmunkplayer.free.fr/command_list.html" target="_blank"><i>Command list here</i></a> / <a href="http://chipmunkplayer.free.fr/Hardwired_commands.xlsx" target="_blank"><i>List in Excel format</i></a> / <a href="http://chipmunkplayer.free.fr/libvlc.zip" target="_blank"><i>Libvlc dll's here</i></a><br><br> <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&amp;business=phoebe8%40free%2efr&amp;lc=GB&amp;item_name=Blitz%20Hardwired&amp;currency_code=EUR&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_SM%2egif%3aNonHosted" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_GB/i/btn/btn_donate_SM.gif"></a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Sometimes bugs base on simple misconceptions and if you finished building your whole foundation you have to replace one the code bricks at the bottom: good luck not creating new bugs then.<br><br>Take each bug report serious - else you might run into a deadlock as nobody will early adopt your code.<br><br><br>I know you put a lot of effort into something and people cannot force you to do things, but keep the above in mind when doing things. Fixing bugs is the most boring and tedious kind of work done with code. I enjoy adding features, but bugs need to get fixed first (except you researched already that this bug is because of another thing which is subject to get changed soon).<br><br>PS: I experienced that many times now: people recognize bugs I am not able to reproduce on my dev computers ...but then after deep investigations and trial-and-error (to force erroring out/crashing) it is mostly something simple hidden in very old code (sometimes 5+ years ago) which is now - in combination with new code - is producing faulty results (happens if you do not unittest everything). <br>So save your time of "later" with researching reported bugs "now"... and yes I am aware of many bugreports being bugs in front of the screen instead of your code.<br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I don't even call this one a bug personally because I designed the function to change an existing window's title name - so it was deliberate.  All GuyFawkes wants is that dxAppTitle changes the name of a window <b>before</b> the window is created.  Seems straightforward enough to me.  I am just not yet devoting the time it needs to it, that's all.  It's understandable I have my own priorities.<br><br>If you don't think I take bugs seriously you should have seen I pretty much devoted <a href="/posts.php?topic=102132" target="_blank">an entire thread</a> to a bug concerning textures six months ago.  I didn't give up on it and I got there in the end.  This was a major bug, so I gave it a high priority.  Sometimes I do even come to dead ends with bugs, like everybody else I would think.  If I do, I leave it after a certain amount of time and come back at a later date.  Giving it time for reflection sometimes helps and when you come back to it the bug can be staring you in the face.  Sometimes a bug can also have a domino effect on other code too.  It can also even be beneficial sometimes to begin on new code, as this can purely by chance, help reveal the source of the bug. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You see no improvment for instancing for I have done no more on it since your last post on the subject.  I decided to begin on user created shader commands.  That way I can test out my hw shaders and perhaps see where the problem comes from.  I have almost finished with base commands for user shaders.  After that, I will be testing anew.  For me, no question, your machine CAN handle instancing.  It's my sloppy programming that's at fault.<br><br>@MadJack - Think I know where the problem lies with that.  I'll fix that tonight.

Such buttons are really easy to produce if you use tools like PhotoShop (I have a really old CS1, but it does what I want from it):   vector rectangle with rounded corners, multiply-gradient-effect (so a base color defines the "button color"), a drop shadow with adjusted values,  text and "icons" are drawn "multiplied" (so they can be grey but get a color mix of the underlaying color).<br>Most time consuming was looking-writing what you have typed on your buttons.<br><br>When doing such things for websites you nowerdays even do no longer need a picture as CSS can handle it already (gradients, shadows and multiple "layers" with :after and :before).<br><br>If you have Photoshop: <a href="http://ge.tt/1jW18Oo1/v/0" target="_blank">here is the PSD file</a><br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The scope of the project is huge, and it will take me time to perfect the code and eliminate loopholes.  So expect more bugs, as they will come.  But do not expect me to deal with them right away, I have my own priorities with hw developement -  if I get sidetracked all the time I won't get much done and the developement risks to become very stunted.  Bugs will be noted, but I will follow my own pace - I have to.<br><br>It is also to be noted, this I have already stated that I have never ever released anything completed.  I have only ever relesed one other thing in the past on to the net(chipmunk is in hibernation but I do wish to continue with it some day), but this is not complete either.  GuyFawkes, I will tell you this, please do not put all your eggs into one basket.  Although I have a lot of motivation for hardwired and have got quite far with it, I am to all intents and purposes a beginner in this field with no track record or experience.  I do want to finish HW and I want it to do well.  But I can garantee nothing whatsoever.  I have never lied about that and I have never made any promises about hardwired's future.  I want it to succeed, sure.  But I must keep my feet firmly on the ground.  Please do the same and remain realistic about it all.  It is possibly a project that I am just not capable of finishing.  I really will give it a good shot, and I refuse to give up a project that I have spent so many hours developing; that would be a waste of time.  But who knows, perhaps at the end it is just too much for me.<br><br>What I need is time to perfect it all, and concentration.  The more I have of both the more likely that hardwired will get somewhere.  But I will very shortly be taking another break from it.  It's hot summer weather now -outside time, it's the school holidays - gotta keep the kiddies ocupied, and I will be on holiday myself - going up to London to see my brother.  So hardwired will probably sleep for a good part of august.  Hardwired is a very ambitious project but when it comes down to it, it's not going to take 5 minutes to complete. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Dont worry about that, but it'll take time.  I am <b>very very</b> confident about that.<br><br>If however it does become too much <i>(who knows)</i> I <b>WILL</b> give up.  If I realise it is really impossible after trying all I could to solve bugs and I just can't solve it, I will happily give up; saying 'well I gave it a good go, in any case'.  I am not going to drive myself mad writing hardwired.  That's all.<br><br>Hardwired for the moment is very much in developement, much will change, some functions will even disappear (not the b3d commands, they definately will stay).  I have much to fine-tune and to add.  Just do not put too much faith in my abilities, please.  I am not in any way feeling pessimistic, but realistic - I know that anything can happen.  And since I am not charging anything for hardwired I have nothing to lose by saying that at any moment hardwired could become a lost cause.  I <b>do not at all</b> wish this but I have learnt that anything is possible and life is very ready to send us some very unexpected surprises from time to time.  The show's not over until the fat lady sings - for HW that dame is not even in the building for the moment!  There still is a lot to be accomplished. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
