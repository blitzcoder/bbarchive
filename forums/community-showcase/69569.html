The demo includes one of the biggest battles in the game. I'm trying to nail down min specs here, but you're going to need a reasonable machine and vid card. However, if it's too sluggish, you can turn off the glow and complex sky fx in options for a boost(glow is off by default).<br><br>Default keys are WASD and mouselook for the turret. Q for stop. Function keys to activate powerups (if you have enough powershards). Recommend you play the training level first - the demo level might be quite tough otherwise).<br><br>Hope you all like it!

At first, I wasn't expecting such big playgrounds.  It was a pleasant surprize in some ways to experience this game as it is a very intuitive way to maneuver the tank.  Yet some things could be imrpoved on, but not in the question of game experience really.  The first thing I noticed is how uncomfortbale I was with aiming at long distance.  It seemed a little random as to wether I will hit the target.  The next thing would be that it was a little frustrating to have faster smaller tanks shooting at me and feeling clumsy at trying to get them in my target shooting.  But it was ok.  I would of liked dropping mines, or maybe a fragment bomb.  But it seems this demo doesn't have that feature.  Having a fast automatic rifle would rock.  To resume, more weapon types would be a real treat.<br><br>My verdict is Kick ass game concept, a rich demo to try out, entertaining experience, but limited weaponry on the player side, which could get frustrating.  If you want to feel like a Rambo, you'll feel left by.  But if you're an amateur of TRON like I am, you'll fall in love instantly!<br><br>NOTE: I remember long ago (2003?) you used to post screenshots and you had something going on and I knew it would rock because of the TRON concept.  Yet I waited and wondered when it would start taking shape.  Anyhow, good show!  Configuration wise, I have a 2.8ghz AMD dual core Opteron and a ATI X850 class GFX card with 256MB GDDR3, and the game was runnign smooth with zero slowdown whatsoever. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It seemed a little random as to wether I will hit the target. '<br><br>I've implemented splash damage so if your shells land relatively close to an enemy, you're still dealing damage. Other than that I think it is a matter of practice. Also, the demo level is actually level 10, so you'll get some practice at shooting targets both near and far before then (in the full game).<br><br>'...it was a little frustrating to have faster smaller tanks shooting at me and feeling clumsy at trying to get them in my target shooting'<br><br>Heh - that's actually what I was aiming for - the idea that a single skirmisher is not much of a threat, but a group can be dangerous - (think mutant dog packs in Stalker).<br><br>'I would of liked dropping mines, or maybe a fragment bomb. But it seems this demo doesn't have that feature'<br><br>Actually, it does - check out the F1 - F6 powerups on the rightside of your screen. If a powerup is bright, it's ready for use. If it's dimmed, it's installed, but you need more powershards. If it's very dim, it's not installed at all.<br><br>If you go into the cavern (1st demo level), there's an upgrade port at the end (where you destroy the powerstack). Look for it on your radar. This gives you multi-rockets, which are very sweet. When you're in range of a group of enemies, hit F3. You'll see reticules appear over the targets. Fire and you'll launch a burst of deadly rockets. Sweet. You can use rockets to clear the fort quite nicely. (But be careful! Don't launch them at close targets or in the cave as they'll damage your tank as well!)<br><br>Mines - since the area is so large, they're not much use on this level. I have several levels that are mazes and they're much more effective. However, press F to lay a mine (cost 1 powershard per mine).<br><br>Also, smokebombs - F5. Cheaper than rockets. Launch a smokebomb and any enemy in the cloud's range will become confused and unable to fire. This includes turrets. If you move into the smokecloud, enemies will find it difficult to target you. You might want to use a smokebomb when you need to get near the fort entrance the first time, or when you're trying to get into the fort.<br><br>Thanks for the feedback!<br><br>Has anyone reached the second demo level? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

By the time I cleared my path up the center hill into the fort, the titans where already there.  There was like 3 enemy tanks left that I watch the titans crush. I got a kick out of that! :) So i guess i showed up to the party late, the fort doors where all open and that little blue tank just had to get to that red key before me! :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It looks cool no doubt.  There's a horrible weapon imbalance.  The enemy tanks have lasers and I have a slow shooting weapon that is affected by gravity (lasers aren't obviously).  The enemy tanks should shoot just like the main tank, or, give me a turbo laser.  The weapon difference makes it just laborous to kill anything.<br><br>The turrets are wiping me out before I can get close enough to shoot em. Blam, hey where did that come from, blam, erm...ok I'm gonna keep moving to avoid the shot, blam, ok that didn't work, blam, crap I'm dead.<br><br>Just my honest 2 cents.  It's by far one of the coolest looking blitz3d games I've ever seen.  With more gameplay tweaking and balancing (which I seriously hope you consider), it's gonna rock even more than it already does. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Then there's medium tanks who have shots that are equal to your own and which behave like your own (i.e. curve). Then there's heavy tanks who have 'straight shots' and can do a lot of damage if you get hit. There is 'balancing' going on, but if you just burl in expecting to be all powerful, you'll get 'lessoned', as Puki puts it.<br><br>'The turrets are wiping me out before I can get close enough to shoot em'<br><br>The idea with turrets, is to keep an eye out, keep out of range (I'll repeat that 'keep out of range!'), and shoot them from a distance, because yeah, they are dangerous. So try shooting them from a distance and hold down the mousebutton to 'charge up' a shot.<br><br>As for the 'laborous' nature of the combat - it's a tank game so you're not going to get a machinegun to play with.<br><br>And did I mention? Keep out of range of the turrets! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
