It scarcely competes with stuff that was being produced with Blitz3D a decade ago.  If you're going to post in the Blitz Showcase out of all the stuff that's on the LE site, then why would you pick something so crude and basic?  Because its Blitzmax?  If that's the reason, and this is the best/only game Blitzmax + LE is responsible for, then I probably wouldn't have bothered.<br><br>That is all. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This is the showcase forum and critique is to be expected when you post here.  If all JoshK wanted (and I'm sure he can speak for himself without you wading in with childish insults) was unashamed back-slapping and relentless fawning, then he would have said so in his post.

More than just barrel physics.<br><br>Basic AI using a navigation mesh, AI sound/health/weapon, weapon effects/sound, basic movement, basic GUI, basic radar GUI, day/night cycle with clouds, none of that comes packaged with LE and is written from scratch by Marley's Ghost.
