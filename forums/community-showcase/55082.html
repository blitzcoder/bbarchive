Maybe that's within your expected tolerance limits though. That  on an old ti4200, and I've not tried it on the fx5900xt yet, but since it's been limited then there'e not all that much point.<br><br>Thanks very much for some fair fun. Seemed nice and smooth.

The problem is that the vehicle center of mass verlet is quite heavy and therefore hinders your ability to climb slopes at a low speed.   I need to work on that but don't really want different gears etc.. if I can avoid it.   Atm I'm simply applying a max-traction force to the wheels based on the throttle position.
