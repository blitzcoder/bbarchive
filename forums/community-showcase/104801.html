I use a monster type, with each different type of movement dealt with separately. your man is also the same type, so a single base type that handles basic moment in any direction works across the board.<br>* Each monster then decides what it is doing and does it (move left, right, up, etc) Different movement types, would have different logic, but the underlying system is the same.<br><br>collision, detection<br>* for any movement. check to see if you can move in that direction (4 directions) and the move (if possible)<br>* because movement is sub square based. I actually use y rotation on every monster. This way you know the explicit direction the monster is facing<br>* when a monster goes in a different direction, you also need to rotate the facing direction t cace that way. I do this in steps so the monster/you will turn to face slowly<br><br>I did a lot of pre-work (see all the entries over the years) and came up with this:<br>* a generic monster type that has everything a monster needs, position, type, rotation, etc<br><br>a fixed number of monsters (I currently have a max of 200) - in a linked array<br>a monster is added to the array when it is 'born' and remove when it dies. some monsters are born, but not active!<br><br>* collision detection is number based. <br> - you have the four corners of the monster<br> - you have the map<br> - check if each corner is colliding at that map position (beware of sub positions - hence ditching float for a custom fixed point)<br> - sliding collision, etc is automatically handled: if new space free then move<br><br>---- each frame ----<br>* update any existing monsters<br>  - the monster update will check if there is a collision with you too<br>  - decide any moment, etc<br>* check user input<br>* display<br><br>* maps:<br> - currently it's all dev so I just press R to regenerate a new level (it's now instant).<br> - in practice there will be stairs, ladders, holes, etc to go between levels<br> - the map is completely separate from the display - so it could be shown as ascii or flat. I chose to use my 3d view<br> - I spent weeks fighting with auto generation of dungeons - they are really hard to do without becoming boring. the more detail you want, the harder the code becomes.<br> - I'm currently playing with a very simple start room, add doors, try to add room &lt; repeat<br> - one thing I found was to do with progression from room to room. Say you want a locked area - where do you put the key?<br> - I now use a system where the first room is 1, then next room (which can be accessed from 1 is 2. the next room (could be from 1 or could be from 2) is 3, etc<br> - so is there is a locked door that goes from room 5 to room 12. the key can simply be put any any room 1,2,3,4,5 - a quick random and placement<br><br>* doors<br> - doors come in 2 type up/down and left/right - this handles the different directions needed to access each door<br> - doors are then solid - closed or locked - you can't pass<br> - or open - open or bashed in - you can pass <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Note, I haven't done music as I need to get the code ready for that.<br><br>So Now I have a framework, with base models (blank floor, blank wall, blank monster/you). I then worked on the movement and basic map system (in essence the first image in this message (although it has more advanced graphics)). All monsters use the same core code, so I just needed to get this right, and all monsters will be right (with error checking on the map, etc. It turned out that this wasn't working as expected and I needed to do a quick and dirty fixed precision number system.<br><br>--------------<br><br>So at this stage we now have basic mapping, movement, blank graphics, etc. User input, sound, page systems (start page, options, page, etc) are all handled though a number of files that make up my game framework - they are all agnostic so can be used to make any system.<br><br>you can move, there is a map, you can drop a bomb, it goes off and destroys stuff - basic bomberman.<br><br>Another person (who sometimes comments) was doing something very similar - so similar I needed to form the concept into something else. I toyed with walls, and wall hiding. and then also remembered nightshade (ultimate plays the game). I went and had a look and liked the graphics and thought "medieval town looks nice, wall hiding, nice..."<br><br>So I took everything and stared in that direction.<br><br>Taking the rpg concept I had before and got as far as I could with the graphics ssystems. I liked at what I had and thought How can this be a game? My prior issues were to do with making something look pretty meant you have to design it. I wanted it procedurally done - so I have no idea of the end result.<br><br>Now (taking all prior work and concepts) I sat down and though how do you create something that feels like a place (with what I have got). I have rooms and an order (I didn't have this before) - this means I can set a goal and lock rooms. Group rooms together can form a house. thin about how the village would be made up, remove some walls to make gardens and smaller dwellings. Add some water (or not) and decide if the water surrounded a house, maybe this could be a mill. if we have a mill then the people would not be too poor, etc, etc, etc<br><br>The basic gameplay is still the same: map, movement, drop bomb. everything else is just gravy - complex gravy, but just dressing.<br><br>I also have more and more complex building routines to decide the makeup of a village. Here is the text output from a couple of runs:<br><pre class=code>

no mill
