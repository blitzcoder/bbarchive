It's more a quicky, if you want. Maybe because I made it easier, so it seems to be smaller because you can complete it earlier. Anyway, it was a test for the new features. I really wonder how the multitexture underwater caustics worked for you.<br><br>Because this is as well a new pretty sophisticated method I use. In Decorator I appy Textures with a special string in their names to underwater zones. Those surfaces can be regognized at runtime, and additional brush layers will be applied to them, using an animated water texture.<br><br>The animated water texture is as well something new because I worked hard on this sin/cos distorted water animated texture.<br><br>Mixing the sin/cos animated watertexture with the screen distortion effect when under water was a further challenge.<br><br>I am not planning to release this engine as a multiplayer thing, instead I will concentrate on a real entertaining story. Maybe I'll add a AI partner for the player, maybe a dog, cat or raven.<br><br>If I am going to make something multiplayer in th near future, I'll start from scratch and make something arena-like. The philosophy is completely diffrent. In a single player game there is a story, a start and an end.<br>In MP there is an ongoing Competition, conversation and community (Spacestation deathmatch showdown as well as War scenes with teams etc.). MP games that use single player engines in a "we against the NPCs" mode are most times half-hearted imho. If you want to make this real good, it's very hard. Too hard for me, maybe.<br><br>But anyway, I am looking for level designers who want to coproduce levels for an upcoming indie release - just for fun, because it is likely that this engine won't break into the market and competite the big ones.<br><br>Jeremy I am sorry I forgot you in the credits. I just didn't have the time to sample all nicks (and then the list would also be much much longer :)). I tried to find a user list (once we had it here), without success, so I spent one hour or so to copy paste as many users as possible, mainly from recent threads in this forum. The best way to be in the credits would be to coproduce levels with me :)<br><br>@Noel - if you don't really like the smoothed camera, press F2 and deactivate camera smoothing. It will then be completely non-smoothed. Pretty unrealistig IMHO, but anyway.<br><br>I totally agree with the Swim-problem. Actually there is no swim mode at all. You have to decide: dive or get out of the water, using the ladder.<br><br>I really wish to add a working swim mode soon, but currently this is kinda dilemma since the engine structure makes it real hard to implement this properly. I am waiting for the ultimative idea to solve this :)<br><br>I do now think this engine becomes one by one something that is more than 50% of a commercial engine, this means the goal is not so far as the beginning of it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The work was worth it.  I also liked the lighting effect and the ambiance with cut scenes was a lot better too.  I can see where the effort went in.  I just always like to see some good multiplayer action for a FPS even if there's single player.  I wouldn't expect the multiplayer to be co-op but maybe just some sort of innovative head to head mode.  Maybe one player can be all the guards and the other must still try to complete the mission.  Still if that's not what it's meant to be, that's not what it's meant to be so no biggie.  Good luck with the rest of the levels etc ... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I am happy if this release is noticed at all :)<br><br>Sorry for notoriously not answering PMs on BC :)<br><br>I agree, gravity and jumping are very weak points. I am thinking about to rewrite the whole gravity system. It's just a big patchwork atm.<br><br>As for the intro I have to say - I didn't have the time to make something real nice. I know, the scientist looks horrible, esp. his hands when close up to the camera. This is worse than HL1 :) But anyway, it's telling a story. BTW the Ant has a texture, but for some reason it is missing in the intro , but it's there in the game. I just realiszed this bug, cause the texture worked fine also in the intro when I tested the zip on the development machine. Strange, cause it works one time, then it doesn't. Maybe I had 2 ant Models in there, and one used a static path. Not a big deal imho.<br>The idea with the bullet holes is a good one. I have also thought about to use diffrent sounds on diffrent materials. For this I'd have to index each and every surface right after loading. This surface list could then also be used for various other things like footsteps etc.<br>But honestly, there is so much real basic stuff I first got to fix, to do or to finish. Eg. the gravity system, or a better weapons system (scrollbar HUD thing, yes, Mousewheel is a good idea too) including a realistic Reloading system, that will mess up the whole weapons loader of course, so upcoming versions won't be compatible, but who cares. Furthermore 3th person view, other scoring for shooting at enemies (headshots etc), although this will bring up new problems with one-mesh characters...<br>There is a lot to do and I ask myself if I'll ever have the time to do it all by my own. At least, we slowly start to find it no more so very unrealistic to compare this work of a single person with the commercial engines that were produced by an army of highly specialized pros.<br><br>Well, I still love to create levels, and that's the most important thing to me.
