It's made in BlitzMax using my Grey Alien Games framework.<br><br>This game was my wife's idea and she has been part of our two person team throughout the last year whilst we made it (we also hired in artists and a musician as contractors.)  She researched the locations and costumes, created the characters and wrote the story, and helped me with the overall design and level design/testing.<br><br>Some of you may know that I programmed a game called Fairway Solitaire with Big Fish Games back in 2007. My new game uses a similar base mechanic (the mechanic is a patience variant called "Golf") but is a completely new codebase, plus I have also added a bunch of new stuff to this game to keep things interesting for players.<br><br>Here's a video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W2GM1ECbwU" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W2GM1ECbwU</a><br><br>You can buy it here: <a href="http://www.regencysolitaire.com/" target="_blank">http://www.regencysolitaire.com/</a><br><br>It's currently no.1 on iWin and will be on BFG and other portals later in the month.<br><br>Players seem to love it, which is good news as we put a lot of care and effort into making it great.<br><br>Please check it out and tell your friends and family if you think they might like it.

I am always envy of the nice decorations (the swirls) people are able to draw and bring into life using shadows and lights).<br><br><br>But hey, it wouldn't be Derron, if he wasnt nit-picking something. Ok, so there were 3 things I would "criticize" (need a lighter word for this, as it isn't really a big thing):<br><br>- multiplier not centered on both axis<br>- outer curve of the card deck is pixelated (happens to me when placing the vector handles "pixel perfect" in Photoshop - so moving the handles 0.25 pixels on their "side"-axis might smooth out everything)<br>- bigger border elements have a dark border, the "decoration" does not -&gt; visual recognizeable difference especially in the marked area. The bottom border of the title "panel" has no dark border because of the lighting... makes it brighter as possibly intended <br><br><img src="http://abload.de/img/2558_annotatedqzuuw.jpg"><br><br>I personally also think that the inner circle of the card-cutout on the bottomleft / topright is using a to small radius - making it looking "bulgy". I leave that as "artistically intended".<br><br><br>Do not feel attacked by above critics, it is - like mentioned - just something very small compared to the rest of that really greatly looking game.<br><br>Additional personal hint: Did you think of lowering the card-brightness to the back (just very small steps - like "-3" per card) this might not be physically correct (as cards have a thickness of "nothing" so there is not much height created through a staple of cards) but might introduce the similar "depth" the decoration elements create.<br>Also possible would be some kind of "dropshadow" on the top portion of the card - but only when "not dragged" and there is some underlaying card. <br>I understand that "shadows" or "darkening cards" removes brightness of the game ... so I dunno how the result would look at the end (from the consumers "view").<br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Thanks for the RT today too.<br><br>@Hardcoal I have plans to make a gameplay one but just haven't got round to it. Screenshots help get an idea. So much to do post-release! Will do soon though.<br><br>@Derron Thanks for your feedback on those various things - I agree with most of them and I don't mind.  I thought I'd reply to a few things so you get more of an idea why those things are in the game:<br><br>- Firstly, I also have an eye for detail, which is partly the game looks like it does. We spent a lot of time researching what we wanted the art to look like, then got lots of examples, and made many mockup screens/art and sent all this to the artists with detailed instructions.  Then, whenever the artists sent anything I looked over it very carefully and then sent back comments to get it refined.  However, there's only so many times I can do this before it drives them insane, and I really pushed my luck on this game.  So once I get the "final" version, I still open it up in Photoshop and fiddle with more things.  However, when you ship a game there's normally a large list of stuff that you would have liked to have fixed/added but just didn't have time.  At some point you have to just go "OK, this is going out the door today" as long as all the major stuff you wanted done is done.  I hope all that makes sense. People who've shipped games, especially to a deadline (I had one), know this well.<br><br>OK onto some specific replies:<br>- The multiplier is not centred on purpose. Huh? Well I didn't want to centre the whole string as when it counts up rapidly it has a different width for ever number (1.0 is not as wide as 3.0) and that makes the horiz position of the x flicker and the number move around a bit too and I dislike that.  I prefer to have a fixed coord for the x and the left side of the number. Also when the number is higher, e.g. 2.0 or more (which is wider than 1.0), then it appears centred. Also I prefer the x to be on the same y baseline as the number and I vertically centered the multiplier based on the x rather than the number because I felt it looked better that way.  So maybe already you are getting the idea that I think about every area of my game, and try out several things before settling on what you see...Some devs just slap in whatever the artists deliver first and it shows.<br>- The card was supplied in a much larger version by the artists and I had to scale it down in photoshop to the correct scale. I tried out several minor variations in size based on which one gave the crispest outline and that was actually the best one (the others looked blurry), then I used smart sharpen on it at a specific value.  Perhaps I could have manually tweaked the pixels some more too, but sometimes you've just got to move on (see my first point).<br>- Border variations. Yep valid critique. Just again, had to move on and not hassle the artists. I actually spend HOURS getting rid of tiny anomalies (zoomed right in) on the various borders throughout the game that the artists supplied, but didn't fix shading.<br>- Card cutout. We tried lots of variations here and spent a long time designing the card layout and that's our final design we are happy with. The cutout is actually a Georgian style cutout so true to the interior design of the time period.<br>- Yes I did consider making each card darker based on depth but a) it was going to require extra code that I spent time on something else instead and b) from a playability point of view, it's better to have them all darker and top layer brighter so that it's clear what you can click on, and when a card is uncovered it suddenly goes brighter. Buy it and try it :-)<br>- dropshadow. I don't fully understand you. There is a subtle drop shadow on the card at the moment.  Something I do that other solitaire devs don't often do is, when I have many cards piled on the stock or foundation I only draw the TOP one so that the transparent shadow isn't drawn many times and looks too dark.<br><br>There are tons more tiny things I fixed that you can't see now, and lots of little things I didn't have time or it wasn't worth fixing. If I made the game perfect it wouldn't be out for another 6 months and I'd have to pay the artists twice as much.  Also I've noticed that many customers are not too discerning as they give 5 star reviews to games that really don't look or play great.  As long as this game looks reasonably above average (I think it does) then it will hopefully do great.<br><br>OK no more long replies after this one as I'm too busy :-) I hope you get my main point about I see a LOT of stuff but can't fix everything as it's not viable from a business standpoint, and I'm running a business here. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You correct(ish) on the dates. I got BlitzMax in late 2004 and fiddled around with some stuff before release my first commercial game, Xmas Bonus, in Dec 2005.  I swapped to BlitzMax in 2006 so I could make use of scaling, rotation, alpha blending etc and that's the year I started my frameowkr.  It's not been an easy ride over these past 10 years but it is satisfying to release a new game for sure.<br><br>@therevells Yep of course :-) The artists always like to make stuff larger though, so it was the correct aspect ratio, I just had to scale it down.

Read: you only have 425 newsletter subscribers ... and got that much sales from it? I assume that most of the subscribers will ignore 90%+ of the mails they get... they read them from time to time or never.<br>I have something in the 30k newsletter subscribers, but did not mail them for years - because there was only a handful of readers (PIs jumped a bit the days after a newsletter ... but this was in the lower hundreds then).<br><br>If you believe in your "direct sales" through "newsletters" you might trade "efficiency" (conversion rate) against "potential" by gifting one of your casual games each month to X random newsletter receivers. Or better let them sign something each month on your website - so you only get the ones really interested. This increases your website popularity (installed toolbars tracking it, more links to your newsletter coming from sites collecting such competition games).<br>Another option is to chose a random facebook friend to win a licence ... just to increase your facebook "friend" range. But as facebook allows to "ignore ad postings from X", this advertisement-branch is drying out.<br><br>@35%<br>Yepp, like said you pay for their traffic. Maybe increase your traffic by providing a chance to talented "lets players" to spread around 2-3 licences, or give them access to your games (not just one, but more of them - and the ones in the future).<br>My (oss) game was reviewed by a lets player only having some thousands of listeners ... but my download count (of that months release) was raised by about 6-700x. So they just have some influence (which I cannot explain).<br><br>Not all of them are interested in that kind of game but of course there will be lets players with a wider audience who are willed - you just need to find them (I luckily was contacted by the lets player ... because he also wanted to interview me about the game).<br>On the consumer side "casual games" have one big problem: they are small in size and it takes no longer than 1-2 days until a illegal copy could get downloaded on the various "warez" sites... I googled for "regency solitaire download" and already on page 1 I got the "TE"-release presented. So it just needs some clicks to get your game for free ... and because of the filesize it is just a matter of seconds to have it on the hard disc.<br>I do not know numbers regarding "copies" and lost sales (read: people who use "copies" wont buy your game at all) but if you catch one of the releasers (mostly they get the games provided by someone working for the "portals") you might sue enough money to get rid of the loss of sales through pirating.<br><br><br>So to close this posting: Direct sales are of course a powerful instrument - but they need a wider audience to reach a break even potential. Keep up selling things and promoting yourself via social media and your website... numbers will increase slowly but hopefully steadily. And with the right pr actions you might sell something here and there (although I doubt people will surf to your site and think... "hmm lets buy something, lets look what he has to offer")<br><br><br>I just wanted to offer to make the German translation (if there wasnt one yet) but when googling for "Regency Solitaire deutsch" (= "regency solitaire German") I just found some "boards" providing the self-localized version of your game ... via uploaded.to and consortes ...<br><br>Maybe you should post a "thanks" there ... and explain in 2-3 phrases that you as an author do not go d'accord with it. Maybe it makes a small percentage of their users to think about it (I have come along to such a post when the android-software of someone was pirated - he explained that he does not earn thousands of Euros each month with his app but that he might have given a free licence to one of the pirates if they just do not have enough money to buy the app but absolutely want it -&gt; was on the old "boerse.to" I believe).<br><br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So in no case the sales prices is a calculation of "income i want minus nothing".<br><br><br>@warez and filesize<br>Most of the downloads are done via torrent (filesize no problem), usenet (filesize no problem, but age of the release - free usenet accounts only have low retention times) and sharehosters. Sharehosters (except some like zippyshare - which even provide 100mbit+ to me as free user) tend to have "captchas" or "wait till next time". A Download which is below the sharehosters filesize limit (often 100 or 200MB) is then split into multiple downloads: people will have to wait for the individual download parts. They have to type in captchas etc.<br>BUT ... is your game below the 100MB you only have to wait 1 time, and maybe only have to enter 1 captcha. This lowers the barrier way enough that more and more people use this way of getting the game.<br>The "easyness" of the download decides wether people are going this or that way.<br><br>DRM wont help in all cases - things just get patched out. Even "remote data" could get simulated by a "mini server" plus modification of the hosts-file (so traffic to "mysupergame.xyz.com" gets redirected to "127.0.0.1:1234"). Of course it takes longer to gain enough information for a homemade emulation ...but if you sniff enough data traffic of a original/genuine game to its remote server, you might end up with enough information to emulate that at the end.<br>For casual games this will of course be a thing up to nobody will do. But games like World of Warcraft were sniffed by dozens of users just to provide enough data for the private server's databases - so it nothing "purely theoretical".<br><br>Sorry again for going more and more offtopic (albeit I doubt that this thread here is for pure advertisement of the game - as the potential audience of the blitzmax board will be aware of the thread already).<br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So I'll try to explain a bit more (and probably end up digging a bigger hole in the process):<br><br>I don't regret creating and selling a framework as it was fun and the users (like you) helped to improve it, and some people have gone on to use it successfully (like you), which is pretty cool.  Another company made a really great time management farm game and a bunch of others games with it and it has really helped their game dev career. Other people have just used it for fun or as a learning excercise, which is great.<br><br>Yes BFG totally owns Fairway and their designer came up with the idea. I just coded it and helped with some of the design, and in fact my contract with them said I couldn't make a card game for another year after it shipped (so I couldn't compete). The first clone was Faerie Solitaire, and at the time the dev wouldn't admit it was a clone even though it was totally obvious to the extent that he had unknowingly even cloned a golf flag shaped piece of UI into his game which made no sense in his game. He did iterate on the concept (and added in some new features) to give him credit, and the game has done very well, probably because the theme resonated with casual users more.<br><br>Cloning in the casual game industry is normal, and yes I did it by cloning Jewel Match EDIT: OOPS I Meant "Jewel Quest" which is one of the first match-3 games (which has different levels) and then iterating on the concept each game to introduce new things.  However, what gets me is when people clone things but won't admit it. You have admitted it, which is fine, but others don't seem so honest, and for some reason that irks me.<br><br>If I hadn't posted on these forums (and my blog) about my various success with match-3 games and Fairway and the fact they were made in BlitzMax, I suspect that some forum members would not have made match-3 games or solitaire games. In fact I know that's the case because some people have told me I directly influenced them in that regard.  Perhaps these people would have eventually been influenced by other sources anyway, but posting my information online (and in talks) was definitely a factor. It's not really a problem in match-3s are there are just so damn many of them, but there are less solitaire games and so now I find myself competing in a market with competitors who I may have in part helped create. (Why I didn't make one sooner is too complex to go into :-))<br><br>So then I have to weigh up the good feeling of sharing information over the years with having more competitors in the here and now that directly affect my business (and thus my family's situation.) - though to what extent is impossible to measure.  That's been my thought process recently anyway, and it's the reason many devs DON'T share their stats and certainly why many corporations don't go into details - to avoid potential competitors (I worked at one for 2 years and got to find out many related things.)  Heck, even sharing my numbers has led to weirdness with family members who think I'm rich or something (not true, in case they are reading).<br><br>Anyway, as I said (but don't want to go into details) it's reached the point recently where someone (not from here) who I've shared a LOT of information with is now directly competing in the same space and is using up bandwidth of the same contractors.  That's just not a cool situation to be in, and I've been instrumental in making it happen. So that's why I'm now reluctant to talk about my process and finances.<br><br>I hope that all makes sense and doesn't get anyone's back up too much, as I'm not intending to do that, just explain my through process.<br><br>On the flip side, I've received many emails, and met in person, many devs who have read my blog over the years (or saw me talk etc) and gone into a different space who've said they are grateful for all the information I've shared. That is good to know, but I guess I just need to be a bit more selective now about what I share and who I tell "sensitive" information with.<br><br>P.S. We've been friends for many years and I'd like that to continue, but now I've openly shared my thoughts, and I hope you don't mind or find them too offensive. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Steam have to ask YOU to put their game on it, not the other way round, and they don't seem to ask casual game devs for their games (there are casual games on there but via publishers).  Of course I've still tried to get my games on there (by asking several people there directly), but not yet succeeded.  So meanwhile Spooky Bonus is on Greenlight and maybe Regency Solitaire will go on there too, though casual games don't get many votes on GL due to the type of gamers who browse GL.<br><br>@therevills Yep for sure BFG has huge traffic. Many players know of my games (I talk to them on forums etc) but they prefer to buy from BFG and other portals as that's the way people have been trained over the years.  There's a pretty big discrepancy though between a casual portal giving devs 35% (or less!) and Valve/Apple/Amazon/Google giving devs 70%, something I'd like to see change.  A very small amount of casual gamers know about my site and I do some marketing for each of my games + maintain a mailing list, but wow it's hard. Just wish more people bought direct - that was the main message of the blog post to be honest; that and wouldn't it be nice if casual games got more press?<br><br>@Derron Yes we have approached some let's players and twitch tv broadcasters (of casual games) as part of our marketing and got a couple of videos in the works. Probably won't move the needle though.<br><br>Also yes the pirates "cracked" iWin's version on day 1 and flooded the Internet with it. Sadly that's normal for casual games and it's really not worth fighting them.  I got one site to remove a post with a pirate version but others just ignored me. I could issue loads of DMCA Takedown notices (http://www.dmca.com/FAQ/What-is-a-DMCA-Takedown), but it's a lot of work.  I prefer to just work on new good games and sadly accept the inevitable piracy that goes one.<br><br>Wow it's weird that it's been translated to German already.  I'm actually getting Zylom to do all the translations professionally. My game already supports Unicode files ready for localisation but I want to tweak the game in a few places to allow for lines/paragraphs to expand a bit more, especially for German. So yeah, I'm not sure how good those cracked translations are.  It's kinda annoying, as it might make the game look unprofessional.<br><br>@degac It's just way easier and better customer service to offer a money back thing. I don't want to get into arguments over a $10 game, it's not worth the blood pressure rise. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I can see how someone taking contractor bandwidth is an issue, but I don't think another Blitzer making a game in the same space is an issue.  For example, when my wife finished Fairway, she naturally moved to LoS when it came out.  I just think that the majority of people that buy card or match 3 are going to get what looks best and I don't think one sale is necessarily taking from another sale.  I didn't mean to open a can of worms.  I was just curious.  As I said, I have always greatly appreciated stats.  I am a hobbyist and will probably never release anything, but you never know :)<br><br>I agree on piracy.  I think most people that buy through portals don't even know what warez are.  There is someone on the Monkey forums that is fixated on trying to encrypt and protect his data and art.  It is just a waste of time, IMHO.  I personally won't worry about it if I do release something.<br><br>I'm not sure if you can share(or want to), but with an established property like Titan Attacks, is that a straight contract or is it a revenue share type thing?<br><br>Thanks for the explanations and best of luck in the coming year.  I may just go ahead and get Regency through your site for my wife, then you can get the full cut ;)  One advantage with your releases is that the holiday themes lead to great year over year revenue streams.  As I told you some time ago, Spooky Bonus was one of my wife's favorite ever Match 3's and I think she will love Regency. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I think you see this a lot with the video slot machine games (which I hate because the usability is totally awful), where they more or less switch out graphics with the exact same gameplay. In terms of `being good for gaming` it sucks, but in terms of getting more eyeballs on your products.. probably makes sense. Sometimes it's not a game of having the best product, but of casting the widest net to have more chance of getting people to pay some attention... sort of like one game that takes on the form of multiple games, so as to have more entry points. Just a marketing strategy I guess.<br><br>Regarding direct sales to a website... it's great if you can get the traffic, but getting the traffic is the hard part. Your website has to appeal to an audience and be original and engaging and have quality content. That also means it has to have quite a lot of good pages and be useful, e.g. articles with tips and stuff that people would want to come to you to see, or to share, rather than just coming to read what your latest news is about your own games. ie you have to tap into other streams of traffic besides just people looking for your product.... cast a wider net. But if you can do it and get better ranked for more search terms then you'll get the traffic and then that can turn into more direct sales. Ecommerce is a whole ball game in its own right. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
