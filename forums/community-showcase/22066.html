It's a 3rd person shooter with anime-style giant robots battling it out in a city environment.<br> <br>It's still a bit rough around the edges, but I thought I'd post it to get some feedback on it. In particular I am thinking of ditching the 3rd person view and cursor/mouse controls and instead having an isometric control with firing limited to the direction you are facing. Any thoughts?<br><br>CONTROLS<br><br>Use cursor keys to move forwards/backwards and left/right.

I like the visual style for the models, the toon-style rendering is handled well.  <br><br>I found it strange that the robots were so nimble yet unable to jump or anything like that.

I kind of like the 3rd person view, though, you might make it so the torso can twist to look one way while the body is running in another direction..  Also, I ran out of missiles, and couldn't find anymore (then they quickly kicked my butt :(  ), but overall, I think it's a great start.  I agree with Dock.. I wanted to jump really bad, but couldn't.. That would be a great feature. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That could be nice!  Also, I found that if I was far enough away from the enemy bots, I could fire on them all I wanted to, and they wouldn't move or retaliate.  I don't know if you intentionally did that or not. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

A few things that would be cool is a large selection of weapons, a torso you can turn, maybe more dynamic robots(more mechanical apearance), Slower movement/acceleration and decelleration.   It would also be cool if you fought in huge domes with awesome diverse landscapes.  Could be very very cool :). Cheers <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I originally setup the AI so that if the enemies were more than "x" distance away from you then they didn't do anything, (not even the idle anim as they were so far away you wouldn't see it anyway) this was done to keep the frame-rate up. I will sort it out.<br><br>There are no more missiles to pick up! I should have put this in the readme, but I forgot. Basically at the top of the screen on the right you have your ENERGY reading. Firing your laser takes 1 point of energy, firing a missile takes 10 points. Your energy slowly recharges (as does your health if you take a kicking!), so the idea is to play a bit of cat 'n' mouse with the enemies. Now you know that, do you think it's a good idea?<br><br>I don't think I'll be able to include destructible buildings as they are all addmesh'd together, again to keep the frame rate up by keeping the number of surfaces low. I want to add more buildings to give it a bit more variety, so I suppose that some of them could be destructible, e.g. power stations or similar?<br><br>I am thinking of a total change in the game actually, replacing all the enemy robots with things like tanks, etc., so you are the only giant robot mech thing.<br><br>Actually, delete the "giant" part there as I am also considering scaling your character way down so it's more of a hard-suit type of thing rather than a giant robot or mech.<br><br>This would also coincide with changing to a top-down or isometric viewpoint and a simpler control system (i.e. cursors to go forwards/backwards and turn left/right with CTRL and ALT to fire) which I am also considering.<br><br>Thanks all!<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Ryan <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
