Same goes for the doors they're easily fixed too (so will have to get around to doing them).  Regarding health - you can't get health back, I tried it once before having health being restored slightly for each monster killed but in the end it meant the player, if they were good, could go on indefinitely.  You *could* just run around the different rooms and avoid the monsters but guaranteed you won't get as good a score.  I'll look into the sword thing.  Thanks for your constructive feedback though.<br><br>Hi Grey - it is improving as I go, thanks.  Since you've completed and polished many games I'd love to hear from you more as to what it needs to be a 'complete' game (keeping in mind I want it to remain a simple game) - if you  are willing then give me an email some time perhaps?<br><br>Hi GfK - a smaller download is available (26MB - all graphics halved in width &amp; height) but sounds like that would be too big for you as well.  It's a pretty tight fit into that 90MB as it stands, the only ways I could reduce the download would be to perhaps remove frames from the characters' animation sequences - I'd rather not do that though as I quite like the smooth animations.  The character graphics are also about the same size as equivalent png images.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Matty <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Sometimes I'd lose 1 health and other times nothing.  So, it wasn't all that exciting.  At no time did I feel as though my character was actually at risk of dying, except by the one or two health he'd sometimes lose when an enemy struck me as I struck them.  Perhaps higher damage and a block would make gameplay more dynamic?<br><br>-Nice use of Poser models ;)  The main character's sword swing did look a bit strange though...<br><br>-I agree with what others have said about collision, but I'm sure you'll touch that up in time.<br><br>-The music was good... it suited the game quite well.<br><br>One thing I'm curious about- the size. What format have you used for everything?  Also, what size is the background image for your levels? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I think the way I can fix that would be to have the enemies try and 'outflank' the player so that they attack from multiple directions, I'm not sure how easy it would be but I think I'll have to put it in.  There is a setting I left on by default which makes the combat easier but it does result in what you've experienced.  This part is something I'll have to work on.<br><br>Poser is a great resource for 2d characters.<br><br>Collision - will be fixed.<br><br>Music - the music is actually temporary at the moment.  It is a song  found on modarchive but have been unable to track down the author, so I probably should not have included it..<br><br>The background images are all 2048x1536 (png format) - although I could use jpgs for them which would drop the size of the level by a few MB.  <br><br>The sprites are my own format which is similar in size to a png image that would fit the bounding box of all frames of animation for the sprite.  <br>As an example - the 'demon' has 960 frames of animation with each frame about 350x350.  If left as uncompressed tgas that comes to 448MB but I store only non transparent pixels and it fits within 50MB then. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you stare at your sprites for long enough you'll really start to see any less frames as being jerky movement, but for people who haven't developed the game, it's hard to notice ;)  Leaving movement up to the imagination (somewhat) can often be just as good as having a ton of frames... since the brain is excellent at filling in the things you don't.<br><br>Unrealistic movement or poses can be much worse than jerky movement. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
