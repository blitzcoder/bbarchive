What kind of FPS you get, etc. When you get near a system like Jupiter or Saturn, how bad is the hitches while the moon meshes/textures load? stuff like that.<br><br>When you select a planet/moon and go there it will orbit it till you cancel the action. If you select the ticket or zigzag then it will move to the planet/moon for 15 to 30 seconds, then go to the next. Ticket selects next target randomly, zig zag selects the targets in sequential order (ie.

I think 16 is quite good enough.

I've tied keycontrols to the mouse buttons. You will still need the mouse to move the cursor, but wherever it calls for a mouse click there is a keyboard key available too. Generally the "Enter" key will select something and the "Space" key will cancle or abort something. The up and down arrows also move you forward and back or zoom in and out. Pressing shift with the arrow keys on moving will increase/decrease your speed faster.<br><br>tiler, This is just guesswork now, i've added a cameraclearscreen command in. I dont know if it will help you or not - it didnt effect my graphics so it cant hurt I guess :P Its hard to know what to do in a situation where different computers do different things without having them both on hand to do trial and error with.<br><br>I also found that I'd made a poor setting in the orbit cam where the moonlettes were too far away so now it should hug a bit tighter... large moons still get too close tho, another one for the bug list.<br><br>Here's the .exe file to save you from a full download, just replace the old exe with this :<br><br><a href="http://public.w3site.us/SSModel/SolarSystemV05a.zip" target="_blank">http://public.w3site.us/SSModel/SolarSystemV05a.zip</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I dont want to simplify the gfx/meshes any more than they are or their quality would be so bad as to not be worth having them in the first place.<br><br>The green triangle flashes are more than likely bad code on my part for re-orientating the camera and draw mode.
