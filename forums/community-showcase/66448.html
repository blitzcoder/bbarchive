This should prove useful for people who, like me, use various modelling programs to produce 3D content and are not sure if their resultant creations will, after export, appear and perform as intended.<br><br>Features<br>-----------<br>- Supports .b3d, .x and .3ds model files.<br>- Models can be freely rotated and zoomed in and out (autospin mode is also possible).<br>- VCR-style animation controls allow for easy playback of animated models, including stepping through each frame and an option for smoothing between frames.<br>- Free moving camera allows models to be viewed from any position and angle.<br>- View models under various lighting conditions (eg. full brightness, spot light, coloured light).<br>- View models in wireframe/solid and perspective/orthographic modes.<br>- XYZ reference marker to indicate model's point of origin.<br>- Instant fullscreen or windowed modes.<br>- Quick and simple file navigation screen for viewing/loading 3D models; predetermine multiple folder paths for fast access to files.<br>- 'Modelvision' is COMPLETELY FREE!<br><br><br><b>Download Modelvision v1.0 <a href="http://member.telpacific.com.au/drekinn/modelvision/Modelvision_v1.0.zip" target="_blank"><u>HERE</u></a>.</b><br><br>Please let me know what you think.<br>Comments, suggestions and bug reports welcome.<br><br><br>PS. I know it's possible to access files through a system-legal file requester via a dll but I desired to achieve this the unconventional way. If someone could please tell me where I can acquire the necessary dll I would be most grateful. (I can then include this method of file access in a future release.)<br><br>Also, does anyone know where I can find a free, half-decent animated model (preferably in .b3d format) which I can use as an example model to include with the program? (There's currently only a static .3ds model, which does nothing to promote the animation features.) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Hmm...  might be worth attempting. As you can see, currently the mouse doesn't get a look-in at all (but that was the idea).<br><br>2) If the model went past the camera then why would you need to zoom-in any closer?! (The zoom-in function actually has a limit and will not venture past the model's origin point.)<br>The zoom speed seems to be determined by the size of the model; large models appear to approach more slowly due to their enlarged scale, whereas the opposite applies to small models, which tend to zip forwards quite alarmingly. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
