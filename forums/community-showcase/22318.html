I choose the chliché elements, as elves, dwarves, fairies and dragons, but I set them in a new world and made a few tiny adjustments to their original properties, and the world of Phantasar, where the story of the game takes place in was born... The story-line was at first very cliché, however picking up my hammer, my saw and my screwdriver I been fixing up the story-line and I must say, I'm really satisfied with what I have now... <br><br>Lots of friends of mine, plus myself have been putting a lot of effort in the game, trying to make it a very good game...<br><br>Basically, I didn't went for a revolutionary game... The object was to create a game I would like play myself, and as a true addict of this genre I have a vision of what is good and what not... I've also been playing a lot of other RPG games, because A. I love them and B. to make my sights bigger...<br><br>The Fairy Tale is a very old-school RPG game (but that old-style is still very popular among the true fans)...<br>I might go into the world of 3D for my next project...<br><br>As it will be hard to give up any ideas since you didn't play the game yet (I'll upload a demo version as soon as possible), you may still give some general impressions on the story and screenshots as put on the site in the link I gave you... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

For sure I know that your CPU capacity is very influencing the walking speed... Really surprising considering I used the Blitz internal slowdown routines to slow it down since it went too fast at first... <br><br>Speeding up battle exists? I myself thought they were already fast (faster than I created before), but it may seem slow since the speed was adjusted to the victory quote which you don't hear if you play the small version (unless you've downloaded the battle vocals), what I do know is that the last screen can be annoying long on, that is because the game needs to reload some data... I'm looking for a more efficient way to chain the battles with the walking engine, but I'm affraid it won't be possible for TFT anymore since that will require too much recoding... <br>Did I point out your true problem there, Grisu or is it really more in the animation? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Pyrus", which is supposed to be one of the most important dungeons of the story, having past that one, only two more dungeons remain to finish the story, and then some bonus material has to be implented...<br><br>There's also a new guy on the project, and he'll do some redessigning of the graphics, starting with the website... He only needed a story, the game characters pictures, and flash, I don't know what he's up to, so I'll be as surprised as you are, when the new website will be there... We've also been discussing an introduction movie, so the game might become really something... <br><br>We've also been discussing my next project "Power Of The Rings III", we both agreed it will be in 3D, but my question about it is, all I know Blitz 3D can do is 3D in perspective, is there also a possiblity to do isometrics? It's not sure which style will be taken, but we want to take both into consideration... Enough on that, though...<br><br>I'll make an announcement when the new site for the game has been completed, and I'm working on it to make the downloadable test version better than it is now... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'm also working on the final bonus stages and some cosmetic features, when that's all finished the game as a whole is ready, then I only need to do some bug-searching-fixing, and I hope to release the game by then...<br><br>Now I'm also looking for good publishers, I already know about Idigicon (if they still do that), but are there more companies who publish games created in Blitz, and what's important for me to know is do they directly buy the product for a large ammount of money, or do I receive money every time they sell a copy? I've created many games before, but never published one, so that's why I need to ask these questions, especially since I can get in law trouble if I receive too much cash in once, I'm unemployed you know...<br><br>Another thing you can do me a favor with is taking a look at <a href="http://mywebpage.netscape.com/Tricrokra/Documentation/Documentation.html" target="_blank">The Official Documentation</a><br>I want you to keep a few things in mind when reading it.<br><br>- MicroSoft Explorer REFUSES to load the right fonts. When I access them with Explorer from my harddisk, it works fine.<br>- Netscape Communicator 7.1 seems to show the documentation best, but ignores a few links for mysterious reasons.<br>- Ignore those Netscape banners, it's simply the price for putting this on a free Netscape account. The version I'll include on the CD-ROM won't suffer from this!<br><br>If you want to help me on this documentation. I've the bad habit of wanting to finish things way too fast, with as a result many grammar and spelling errors, plus that English is not my first language. But even in Dutch I make much silly errors because of wanting to be too fast... If you can point out really stupid errors, I didn't see I'd be really happy...<br><br>And if you are bored, I got a nice thing for you to do if you speak a language that I don't. You can make me really happy when you translate this in your language. I only must note that the copyright part can better be left in English. That goes only for the copyright part. It's because that section is too vulnerable for changing in general, and it may even be I need to change a few rules in negotiation with my publisher... Keep the lay-out the same please... So if you are bored, you got a nice thing to break the boredom, it took me 3 days to write this documentation, so if translating takes you as long as that I took away 3 days of boredom. Aren't you grateful to me? I'd be grateful to you if you do :P<br><br>I can note that Grisu sent me a way to make the message boxes more fancier. I couldn't copy his code, since the dataformat the Fairy Tale uses, is much diffrent from the format he used in his code, but I did take over a few parts from it, coded my own way around a few points to get the same effect. Thank you very much for that contribution, Grisu, it also gave me some important leads for my next project, which is gonna be "Power Of The Rings III"<br><br>So far my story on the things for today, guys... :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
