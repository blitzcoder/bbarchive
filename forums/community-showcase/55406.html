Although this program isn't officially complete yet, this gives you an idea of what I've been coding over the past week or so, or trying to.  Here's the code for starters, you may like the start of this:<br><br><pre class=code>

</pre><br><br>I'll try and get some screenshots in here later, but this proves that I'm getting the hang of doing some cool games (albeit sort of like Atari or NES-type stuff).  I bet the farmers will get their dose of entertainment with a game like this. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I was originally going to make a World War II flight sim, but that idea was taken in a professional, commercial game already (I think that it was Microprose or somebody like that from a long time ago).  However, to make a bi-plane would be a little more difficult, so I decided to recycle the B-17 image and use it in a non-war flight sim, but still letting you toss bales of hay out the door.  Just didn't get enough time to think about another plane that would be better for this. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

For quality work, it's more than 43 seconds, more like 4.3 minutes to 7.25 minutes.  When you want to try and center everything, and work using the binary system when it comes to graphics.  That's all part of the industry, what can I tell you? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I also hope to make a widescreen, 3-D version sometime soon.  For now, the top-down perspective seems to be the easiest form to program right now.  Another thing, I'm probably going to introduce joypad/joystick inputs sometime soon, as well.  Right now, I'll focus on a 4:3 full-screen with keyboard inputs (sort of standard, but this will be a start).  However, I'll start a brand new thread once I make my upcoming project official.  This one with the Crop Duster doesn't seem to fit the times, sorry to say.  It's probably better to do a one-on-one dogfight-type game.  Have yet to think of a name for it.  As for this project, it's not gonna happen, as I am revamping the whole thing from the ground up. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

However, there may be different plane skins, and backgrounds to change the setting of the game (all of the media components are "open architecture" if you wish to mod this game (I'm only one of few game authors in the world that'll let you do this)).

Even tho flight games are all about combat these days, it's about time to look at air combat with plans that involve other than WWII gaming (have we had enough World War II games already?  That's about 65 years ago, for crying out loud!).  My plans now are to make a flight game based in the Middle East, circa 2002, so you know that the game's sort of current.  Yeah, it's where you gun down suicide bombers before they crash into you.  This is a "one-on-one" tournament that I'm thinking of now.  The first plane to knock down the other 20 times wins (sounds like a tournament in Q3A again).  At least this will bring flight games back to the old NES/SNES days of air combat, give or take.  You'll like my new project when I release info in another thread. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
