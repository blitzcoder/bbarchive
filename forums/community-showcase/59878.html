It has no single player functionality other than to sail about.<br><br>There are two boats to chose from each with varying attributes and you can repaint your boat &amp; sails.<br><br>The sea features localised weather (dark patches for good wind, light patches for poor wind) and localised tidal flow, as well as global influences for both.<br><br>The game visuals are configurable and so it should run on a fairly low specification system, but powerful machines are catered for too along with support for widescreen display modes.<br><br>As the game is multiplayer orientated it has a [rewritten] live update feature which will download and decompress any individual files which are not up to date.<br><br>This is a more complex race game than most because of the dynamic ocean surface and fatal nature of running aground.  To control your speed you capture as much wind in your sails as possible by letting your sails out or pulling them in, try to have them fluttering just ever so slightly for optimal speed.  If you are sailing due downwind you can goosewing (where both sails stick out either side) to capture the most wind possible, but this will slow you up if you dont capture the wind fully.<br><br>As the tide goes up and down you may find routes through the map become available, blocked, or risky.  This becomes more apparent as you learn the map.  This release has an all new terrain system with a very detailed texture (in high graphics mode).<br><br><img src="http://sailing.bansheestudios.com/usergallery/newTerrain.jpg"><br><br>Multiplayer is supported by either hosting whilst playing or a dedicated server mode.  Currently the only way to start a race is with admin control, but I do plan to include player voting soon.<br><br>The pace of the races are such that whilst constant small adjustments are necessary to maintain optimum speed you do get some time to type messages, making it an ideal race game for internet play.<br><br><img src="http://sailing.bansheestudios.com/usergallery/multi1.jpg"><br><br>Errors in route planning or an unfavourable wind or tide can hinder even the most experienced players which meens even when there is a wide ability spread new players can still challenge for the win on ocassion.<br><br>Broadband can support up to 99 players in a single game and soon I plan to finish off the ultralow bandwidth mode which should allow even a 56k modem player to play with very large player numbers.<br><br>The game is driven by a console command system, which I intend to tie in with a graphical driven interface in a future update.<br><br>For now here are the important console commands:<br><br>TO ACT AS A SERVER<br>start server<br>auto<br><br>TO ACT AS A CLIENT<br>list<br>server &lt;n&gt;<br><br>TO RESET BOAT: reset<br><br>TO SET THE LENGTH OF A RACE (admin) : length &lt;n&gt;<br>TO START A RACE (admin) : race<br><br>Keys to play the game are:<br>Cursor left/right - rudder<br>Cursor up/down - sails<br>Right Control - goosewing<br>Home - Map<br>Numpad - Camera<br><br>Those running a server who have a firewall or router need to allow TCP/IP data over port 9999.<br><br><img src="http://sailing.bansheestudios.com/usergallery/multi2.jpg"><br><br>Download from <a href="http://sailing.bansheestudios.com" target="_blank">http://sailing.bansheestudios.com</a><br><br>If you wish to play in windowed mode start the game by clicking "DONE" with the right mouse button on the options screen.<br><br>(NOTE: The irc-server operator is no longer in business and therefor the chat room feature will no longer work. This will be superceded with a dedicated meeting room system running on a 24/7 server in the future).<br><br>Programming, Models &amp; Textures: Becky Rose<br>Music: Rachel Nusbaumer <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I've done multi-texturing in another game that has user-customiseable skins but didn't do it on the player models in this (earlier) project.  The idea never occured to me at the time, frankly I was suprised I was able to make the model in the first place as I usually stick to modelling scenery.<br><br>On the terrain I think two of the screenshots are only at medium (default) quality terrain texture setting, the top screenshot is definately the high setting although i've improved the environment mapping since.  I should do new beauty shots really - but I suffer from apathy quite badly!<br><br>IPete2,<br><br>Thank you for the kind words.  As a racing game with 3 or 4 players I did find it a great deal of fun, but getting that many players at once is very difficult and is far too much effort for the reward :/.<br><br>I plan to put in player voting to start races without an admin and also a user interface to drive the console commands to make the game more accessible, then after I move house and get the broadband setup I will build a machine to run as a dedicated 24/7 server so you can log on anytime and hopefully find a race.<br><br>Hopefully this will start to attract a little user base, it doesn't need much, but the ability to log on and race with half a dozen or so people will totally change the enjoyment of the game. :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
