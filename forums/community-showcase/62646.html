You can't directly decide where to place your units or which sectors to attack.  However, you have a lot of indirect influence over the outcome of the game.  The game is real-time, so if you take to long in a sector, you will probably be overrun by the enemy in the adjacent sectors.<br><br>Please give the game a try, and offer your input, because the game play is still being shaped!<br><br>Known Issues:<br><br>- Some memory issues still exist.<br>- High Score functionality is offline at this time. <br><br>Screenshots:<br><br><img src="http://www.FreelanceGames.com/screen_shots/SC24-a.png"> <br><img src="http://www.FreelanceGames.com/screen_shots/SC24-b.png"> <br><img src="http://www.FreelanceGames.com/screen_shots/SC24-c.png"> <br><img src="http://www.FreelanceGames.com/screen_shots/SC24-d.png"><br><br><br>Download:<br><br>www.FreelanceGames.com/bin/Starchon_i24_Setup.exe <br><br>Please select input device from the Option Menu (default Mouse).<br><br>Mouse Controls:<br><br>-Fire "selected" Energy Weapons - Left Mouse Button <br>-Fire "selected" Missile - Middle Mouse Button or Left Control Key. <br>-Thrust - Right Mouse Button or "W" key <br>-Direction - Mouse to Payers Avatar Vector <br>-Select Ice Blaster - "1" key <br>-Select Particle Blaster - "2" key <br>-Select Laser  Blaster - "3" key (auto locks and only fires at Starship when in range; not the Sentinel) <br>-Select Particle Rail Gun - "4" key <br>-Select Sonic Blaster - "5" key <br>-Select Trident Missile - "6" key<br>-Select Carrier Killer Missile "7" <br>-Select Cluster Missile - "8" key<br>-Select Heat-Seeker Missile - "9" key<br>-Select Tactical Nuke - "0" key<br>-Toggle between Sector and Galaxy Map - Spacebar<br>-Enter Slipstream - Click a valid destination from the Galaxy Map<br><br>Keyboard Controls:<br><br>-Fire - Right Control Key <br>-Rotate Counter Clockwise - A or Left Arrow Key <br>-Rotate Clockwise - D or Right Arrow Key <br>-Thrust - W or Up Arrow Key<br><br>I would love some feedback on how to make the game better!:)  <br><br>Thanks Everyone <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This is what I concluded from playing it:<br> the first stage I had to wait about a minute for the baddies to come out. that is too much of a wait. <br>  when I was in combat, by the time I was in battle with the third ship, I was out of my first weapon and was unaware. I thing the weapons should automatically be jumped to the next one as well as be given a choise of which weapons to choose. (this is a high tech game and needs high tech options. Ignore this if you want). there should be weapons ammo either scatter through the map or it should appear when a baddie is destroyed to compensate for ammo usage.<br><br> baddies take too long to be destroyed. I feel that in the first stages, when the player is getting used to the controlls, The baddies should be fairly easy to destroy.<br> as well as the player be given simpler weapons, like the first weapon(weapon 1) but that could destroy the enemies a lot easier. The baddies should, in the first stages at least, move at slower speed than the player not faster. I would like to see that when I thrust and let go of the button I can keep on moving at nearly the same speed.(This is outer space no gravity). That way I can travel in one direction and shoot and turn in any direction to  shoot the baddies when they are chassing me.<br><br>for me what makes it fun is when they come and I destroy and destroy and destroy... and they keep on comming until I am overwhelmed. not when I have five ships in with in range and all are attacking me and I can't even destroy one with all of the bullets in one weapon. Those odds are highly possible but not the way I would like to commit suicide.<br><br>As I said before I am not that fascinated with shooters but I have played some really good shooting games that appealed to me. Don't get offended but as it stands this game to me is a 10 as candy for the eyes. but a 2 in fun factor. this game is one of those games I download, try and dump in my recycle bin. <br><br>I like your game and I feel that with  the right balance of game play the game will have a lot of potential. If you are triyng to sell it consider making it fun for beginers as well as veterans of the genre. <br><br>Cheers :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Looking back, the first level is to hard.  Also, many of you comments are on the mark.  I've already started i25 and all the weapons will be re-balanced.  You may want to give misson two or three a try; it is more of what you talking about.  <br><br>One note, you can jump to other sectors and attack the ships; there is no need to wait.  Just press the spacebar and select a stargate with enemies.<br><br>If you send me your email, I'll make sure you get the next release.  Your imput is valuable.  Lastly, I made the game much harder this time.  This may have been a mistake; level one is really two hard now.<br><br>If interested, send your email to Sean.Doherty@...<br><br>Thanks <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
