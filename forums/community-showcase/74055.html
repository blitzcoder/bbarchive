Right now, I have this huge block of white text with no paragraph indentations or anything, so when new text is added, I have to read over the whole block looking for the new information.<br><br>If this game continues to be as amusing as it is right now, I will definitely be purchasing the full version.<br><br>Edit: Wow, fireflies, nice touch.

Yeah this is really good.  I love the amount of detail that's gone into it.  It's like an Ultima game (esp. with the reagents).  I really look forward to carrying on my adventure in the full version (I reached the edge of the northern map where it said get the full version).  Good stuff and good luck with it!<br><br>The inventory system is good and really easy to use and the shops are great too.<br><br>Couple of minor niggles I had:<br><br>1) I wish the player would walk faster!  Even 50% faster!<br>2) If I highlight an item with the mouse and hold it down, I expect my player to go up to it and Open/Use/Attack it, but it doesn't do that.  You have to move one square away and then click it.  This is quite frustrating and the interface would be a lot nicer if you could do this (Baldur's Style).<br>3) Sometimes I wish I could change the camera angle to see where I'm going and to fight, and to look for items. But I appreciated it's an isometric game so fair enough.<br>4) At the end instead of warning you to save it could say "save now? Yes/No"<br><br>*** SPOLIERS ****<br><br>Oh yeah, my story.  I didn't leave the village right away, I explored that basement for ages, got to a room with some mithril and then couldn't figure out how to carry on so I came back out again but ran out of torches on the way so had to randomly flail my way out, which was touch and go if I was gonna make it!  Then I went shopping in the village, then got the key to the crypt and then...Well that's maybe enough spoilers!<br><br>Anyway brilliant stuff <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You can't pass it, yet it's green like traversible terrain  Maybe the map changes as I get more skil? ...<br>3) Couple of your scroll bars could really do with a little dragging bit in the middle (between the up/down arrows) - this also indicates where you are in the list.<br>4) Escape exits a shop, great, but it doesn't follow the exit cases in the conversation, I have to click those manually.  This would be a neat little optimisation and surely can't be too hard?<br><br>Anyway this is great, such an achievement.  Best of luck with it.<br><br>Now some tips for the beginners (no spoilers):<br><br>1) Get at least one skill point in cartography (or more).  You won't regret it!  Without mapping the game is hard.<br>2) Get a ranged weapon! (you need skill points to use it)  I've been ganged up on too many times and killed.  I now love picking them off at range until they are close, switching to sword and hacking them, and if they run I simple switch back to arrows - cool!<br>3) Don't deviate from where the quest tells you to go (at for the first few hours) or you'll get mashed.<br>4) but tons of torches like &gt;10.  It's no fun being stuck in a dark crypt...<br><br>That'll do for now. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If it's on purpose, I think it's really bad.<br><br>My Cartography skill is six. When I cast Reveal Map, my cartography skill goes up to 21. If I walk around an area with my skill at 21, I get a fairly detailed automap. When Reveal Map wears off, areas that I already revealed with a skill of 21 go back to level six if I walk over them, again. In essence, the game is punishing me by degrading the quality of my maps after I have already made them. This renders Reveal Map nearly useless because<br>A) It's not reasonable for me to completely avoid areas I have already mapped just to avoid degrading the map quality<br><br>  and<br><br>B) It is basically impossible to keep Reveal Map active at all times since fifty turns goes by in about thirty seconds, so I would be draining my mana entirely every couple of minutes, in addition to the fact that I have to keep constant watch on the little message box since there's no effect shown when a status spell wears off.<br><br>I also think there might be some balance issues with casters.<br><br>I'm still very impressed with this game, overall. It's good to see such a polished product come out of left field like this.<br><br>NOTE:<br>- The quest to carry the seventy-pound item displays incorrect information in the quest log (it says eighty pounds, but the item weighs seventy and all the dialog when you get the quest says seventy).<br>- Maybe it's just me, but it drives me nuts that my character's dialog displays, "Show me what you got," when I want to see a merchant's goods.<br><br>SpaceAce <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Critical Hitx2 = 30<br>3) The spellbook is way to slow for casting a spell straight away instead of keeping one "ready".  Say I want to cast Bless, I have to go into the magic book (click icon or press M), click Bless, click Power level, click OK.  Then I have to right click in-game (more on this in a minute) - that's 5 clicks!  Also when I go into the spellbook it would be REALLY useful if it retained your previous power level and spell because once I get level 4 say, I'm probably only going to use that for all my spells and I don't want to have to click it EVERY time.  This would mean you could press M for magic and as level 4 power was highlighted, you could just double click a spell name to fire it off then and there instantly.  How would you store one?  well the OK button could say "store" or something.  AND/OR you could have two buttons to be ultra clear: "store" and "instant" or words to that effect.<br>4) Grammar: In one of the pieces of text I saw "effected".  This is not a real word, you probably should use "affected".<br>5) Is there a hot key to swap primary and secondary weapons?<br>6) Not that I'm complaining but I was thinking that swapping weapons (or lighting a torch) should use a turn so if you have to do it in battle it is "costly".  However, the game is easier with it taking "no time".<br>7) When you autowalk somewhere via the map, really you should recover some health and mana and some time should pass.  However, I guess this leaves it open as an easy way for players to "recharge" without camping and having random encounters so that may be why you left it out.<br><br>Still loving it!

I'll let you know though.  I do think that the game is a little tough though.  Sometimes you fight something and its ToHit and damage is the same as yours, and then there's like two of them, so you're gonna die.  Or if you survive then you have to rest (and get attacked in the night) and then fight the next one.  At least I don't need to buy potions all the time since I got high up in the Divination stat.<br><br>Basically when I'm epxloring a new area I cast a level 4 Bless and Leatherskin (not got stoneskin yet) and these boost my stats enormously.  I've also got pretty good light armour that I've enhanced by using the alchemy skill.  Then I fire my powered up bow at them until they get near, then change to sword.  This tactic is working out pretty well in most cases.  I sometimes use other spells like entangle but it doesn't work on some "big" things (like raptors).  I haven't advanced very far in elemental magic yet.  Basically I started as a warrior and kept getting whipped so decided to branch into bows and magic and that's worked out well.  Frustrated that sometimes I see a great item but don't have enough money and when I go back later, it's gone anyway. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'd KILL for that feature.  It would be the single best thing you could do for the game.  I'm a busy guy and I want to enjoy the exploring, fighting and leveling up but I don't want to walk REALLY slowly everywhere, especially through already explored zomes.

For those people these old licences (pay per platform) means buying software for several platforms which is something no one likes.<br><br>More companies are getting this and if their software is available for different platforms they're changing their licences to a pay per user based system. And sorry if a game is made with a tool which already works this way, then offering the game on a pay per platform basis looks like milking those who are honest enough to buy originals instead of instantly looking for a torrent to me.<br><br>Most of the people don't buy a second licence due to money reasons but they would be happy if they would have the possibility to use it on another platform too if they run into such a situation, so offering a pay per user licence offers instantly more value to the software.

That's the purpose of a crossplatform release.<br><br>But it's likely you aren't loosing a lot as people mostly just stick to one licence and don't buy two or three licences of the same game.

You tie the user and so you're mostly giving away an important advantage which you receive by using a tool like BlitzMax which enables you to do crossplatform releases quite easily.

That offering an crossplatform application seams to be more vaild to you than a game. Some Indie games offer it, mostly those were doing the port is easy.<br><br>You mostly don't see it in big titles because they either a) don't build on a technology which makes the port easy (may it be from the licence costs for the used engine or that it would be a technical challenge to them), b) that it's no digital distribution and so you might run into problems with the delivery (win version ready at the same time as the mac version, more dvds), c) only interested in a certain (mostly win) market and d) that they are greedy and conservative thinking.<br><br>How many sales do you think you'll receive more from people who like to play the same game on different platforms and actually pay for this contrary to those you could gain by offering the feature that they could use it on different platforms if they want to and also do marketing with this feature?
