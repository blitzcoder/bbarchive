This contains 5 animations and 10 poses.  The arms don't move in many of the animations, because they use the poses for the upper body animation.<br><br>Animations are breathe, walk, run, strafe, and jump.  I am particularly happy with how the strafe animation came out, as it was very difficult to make, and looks great.<br><br>Feel free to improve or add to these. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Its one of the very few tools im feel i got my money worth. I really did nto liek version two, but giving 3 away free to version 2 owners really made up for it. maybe you could email me or somethign i cant seem to figure out how to label a mesh as an entity. Basically i want to make buttons that have to be click on in the level. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The strafe especially. The run is rather wooden (the hips should move), and the breath is rather unatural - personally I rarely stand upright with my arms at my sides and feet together. The stance should be more natural perhaps with the characters looking around or something.<br><br>That's my opnion anyway :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I like to have all the limbs oriented to 0,0,0 when the character is standing straight up.<br><br>Also, if you have a mesh on top of that, it just makes it even harder to use the anims for anything else.  In my experience, models rarely turn out the way the animator intended them to.  What I am trying to do is create a set of animations that a mesh can then be weighed to.  I might weigh the mesh with a custom program...it really isn't that big of a deal to do, definitely feasible.<br><br>Since it appears damn near impossible for anyone to make a character model I am taking the matter into my own hands.  I know the way modeling is supposed to work, and that it's theoretically possible, but the fact is it just isn't happening. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I just wish Mark would realise this.<br><br>BTW that b3d pipeline thing doesn't use character studio. You can use the biped but don't have to.
