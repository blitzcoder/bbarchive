First I had a serious game crashing<br>collision problem, that appeared to be a bug in Blitz itself, then an<br>equally bad sound problem, that might have been a glitch in my<br>computer. Needless to say, I will be posting about this in the blitz<br>3D bug forums when i have the time.) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Its been a month apparently since I uploaded this, and the<br>next version is 'nearing' completion.(I say 'nearing' because with programming you never know when you'll run into something that massively increases development time :)<br><br>But I am in need of some <i> very </i> specific feedback, because the<br>new version has changed so much.<br><br>1: Do you like the fact that the maze walls can be pushed by the player,<br>and destroyed by the robots?<br>Does that ruin the 'maze' factor since you technically can just plow through<br>any wall you want to?<br>Because currently in the new version, the walls are NOT pushable, and<br>cannot be destroyed. So the player MUST find his way through the maze to collect all the dots.<br><br>Is the change good, or bad, in your opinion?<br><br><br>2: Are there too many dots?<br>Do you think it takes too long to clear a level?<br><br>3: Is everyone fine if I ditch the overhead view?<br>Or do you like the overhead view too much?<br>Because with the overhead view, the player can find his way through<br>the maze too easily. If I were to ditch it, and keep the player in the<br>first person view, then I would throw in a limited view mini map instead<br>so that the player can see a small portion of the maze around him.<br><br><br>Those three questions should be sufficient.<br><br>Thanks everyone!<br><br>And all previously addressed issues have been fixed.<br>I now have the most awesome title screen in the world :)<br><br>WERDNA <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
