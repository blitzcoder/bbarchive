I'm waiting on graphics to make the levels with, so I figured I'd use the time to clean the game up and get some feedback on how she handles. So, if anyone's interested, I would be most curious to hear what people think. The four levels with the game currently are unfinished, and mainly in there for testing features, but they are completable. When the mission select screen comes up, the top-left level is probably the most intensive in engine terms, I'd be curious to know what sort of chug factor there is on that level, and what sort of hardware has the most problem with it.<br><br>When the game is run, if the sea gets bright towards the horizon, and the title text is in an opaque square, try reducing the number of texture layers and the draw distance in the Settings.<br><br><a href="http://www.optibrain.co.uk/dropfighter/downloads/dropfighter.exe" target="_blank">http://www.optibrain.co.uk/dropfighter/downloads/dropfighter.exe</a><br>The download's about 11mb.<br><br>Screenshots:<br><img src="http://www.optibrain.co.uk/dropfighter/media/take-some.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.optibrain.co.uk/dropfighter/media/going-in.jpg"> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I had a few issues tho:<br><br>On the menu screen (and on the island campaigns some of the time) there seemed to be a lot of alpha textured objects (including the text) not being drawn properly, ie. not alpha'd at all.  On the island campaign it was intermittent and happened to icons and particles as well.  It might be due to the use of terrains, dont ask me why/how tho.<br><br>The menu screen seems to be sluggish, possibly cos there is so much going on (the spinning logo look quite hi-poly).  The actually game seemed relatively smooth.<br><br>I found the plane hard to fathom control-wise, particularly in space but also when I was upside down on the island parts.  I was using keyboard.<br><br>Also, I noticed the sky go all white at one point, altho this might be related to above alpha issues.<br><br>Nice work tho, feels quite polished. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

To take a few of your points:<br><br>The failing alpha: reduce the draw distance, and put your texture layers to 2 in the settings screen. This should fix the problem. Many MX cards seem to stumble on this.<br><br>The spinning logo is fairly high-poly, although I thought a GF4MX would be okay with it. I think I even tested on one. You should see a speed increase when you take down the texture layers.<br><br>I'm going to work on a better camera for the aircraft, one that doesn't stay level with the horizon (although I do prefer that).<br><br>The sky thing is my poor sky code, probably. To get the effect I wanted in the distance, I basically put a blue plane above the clouds. You can just fly through it for now. This will be sorted. :D<br><br>Thanks for trying it out. I'm also heartened to see that gameplay was smooth on an AMD1300, that's the slowest yet that this has been run on. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'll think on that one.<br>-I've not come across this yet. It might actually be more an effect of the camera. I know the ship judders under joystick control, which is a camera issue.<br>-I don't use rendertweening, I don't like it. It doesn't help when the framerate drops below a minimum. I'm using time-based movement control, so whatever the framerate, things move at a constant rate. The logo shouldn't change speed, but it may appear to jump. Certainly, older graphics cards will start to stutter when there's a lot of menu options on screen. Trying (and failing) to think of ways to optimise that. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Then, add the water as a plain. Texture both on the first layer appropriately.<br><br>For the second and third layers of the sea texture, I scaled up a big, blurry texture that is actually very close to black. With the blending set correctly, the non-black parts show up as a gentle grey. I drew it a little stripy, like ripples. The third layer is scaled to be a mirror of the second, and they are then scrolled in opposite directions.<br><br>Finally, the last layer of the water is the cunning transparency effect near the coastline. For this, make a copy of the relief map for the terrain, invert the colours, and then through use of contrast and dilate tools, expand the dark area of the land on this new texture and tighten it up a little. Use this as an alpha mask to make the sea layers transparent towards the island. I don't have my code handy right now, so this last texture might actually need to be the "bottom" one in terms of layers.<br><br>Sorry, that's a poor explanation.

This might be too big for you, but I'll say what I used to give you an idea of their relative sizes.<br><br>The base water texture was scaled to 1500,1500. The other two were scaled to 10000,10000.<br><br>You'll notice the last two textures are identical. One can just be a copy of the other, rather than loading two in. I just havn't done optimising Drop Fighter yet :D<br><br>After all that, just use positiontexture with an increasing offset to keep moving the two similar textures in opposite directions.
