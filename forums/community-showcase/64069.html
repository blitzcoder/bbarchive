I played it to level 24 btw.  Remember this is constructive and just my opinion.<br><br>The BAD stuff first:<br><br>1.  It already knew my name somehow and put it in the game for me.  I definitely didn't like that at all.  I don't want apps snooping around and peeking in the registry etc.<br><br>2.  The BigFish icon being added to the desktop was unwelcome also.<br><br>3.  There's too much downtime in between levels.  I felt like I was spending most of my time looking at ancient chinese proverbs than actually playing a puzzle game.<br><br>4.  The particle effects seemed a bit ordinary and non-unique to the game.  That's probably just the programmer part of me talking and most people won't notice/care.<br><br>5.  Maybe this type of puzzle game doesn't appeal to me but I didn't find myself wanting to continue to play it.  I'm 1 person in a world of 6.5+ billion people so this probably doesn't carry much weight.<br><br>6.  The whirlwind taking a piece out of the puzzle is frustrating.<br><br>7.  When the puzzle is moving up and down, you can see the lines where the black pieces meet.  I used this to cheat and build the puzzle faster because I could tell where the edges were.<br><br>The GOOD:<br>1.  I DO like the aspect that you're moving along a map to a destination be completing each level.<br><br>2.  Overall the menus and coding work really well.  Good job on that part. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Oh, I just tought it would be easier, but you are probably right and we have to think about it if it would be better to ask the play for the name at the first start.<br><br>2.) We have no influence on this, because the installer is done by BigFish Games. We will release an own version soon on our website, which won't include links to BigFish.<br><br>3.) You can disable the progress map and/or the wisdoms at the option-menu<br><br>4.) I also wasn't satisfied with them at first but our artist likes them, so no more work was put into that. Proabably I should rework this.<br><br>5.) The audience for this game are casual gamer<br><br>6.) A lot of other people on other boards told us that, too. It's very surprinsing because no one of our beta testers mentioned it altough we asked them exactly this question. Do you think it would be better if it doesn't appear so frequently?<br><br>7.) You're right. Should be fixed in the next update.<br><br>Thanks again, for your comments... !! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

As for the sound, my wife's first comments on how it sounded upon coming within earshot of the computer were "that sounds good".<br><br>On the proverbs side, I was playing this with my child, and it gave her a chance to practice her reading - some of the proverbs were quite poignant as well.  <br><br>Hope you do well with this, regards - <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
