It was quite simple to make actually and only took a few weeks to do, but my code became very messy towards the end and I had other things to be getting on with. It was definitely a fun game to make tho.<br><br>I like the idea of using different types of lines i.e ropes and balloons etc that I've seen in other similar games. It might be best to keep things simple tho but then coming up with something new might prove to be rather difficult.<br><br>Best of luck with it :D <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
