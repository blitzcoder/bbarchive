It occurred to me that a model I'm working with right now would make an easy comparison, so I put this together:<br><br>www.3darteest.com/downloads/adele_test.zip<br><br>It's not the best comparison since she isn't really doing much, but her right shoulder in particular gives a good example since she puts that joint through some pretty extreme rotations.  Hit R to see the version with rigid weights, B to switch back to blended weights, and rotate left and right with the arrow keys.  Notice how the polygons buckle and overlap in an ugly way in the rigid version, whereas those problems aren't nearly as evident with blended vertex weights.  Oh, and note that I am influencing each vertex by 3 bones. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It is a fact that when you are modelling a rigid vert model, you HAVE to make sure certain verts are in certain places, otherwise it will just look butt ugly. The benifits of using smoothed verts is, you can position your verts exactly how you choose, and make an optimized model, without having to worry that your mesh will break due to the rigid verts.

Your exact words were "model freeform," which, given the context, meant one does not have to position vertices carefully (ie. the reverse of your comment that "with a rigid model, you have to position your verts carefully.")  Note that you are still saying that: "you can position your verts exactly how you choose..."  This is incorrect, and it annoys me that you are passing out incorrect information as though it is correct.<br><br>With or without blended weights it is vital to position your geometry correctly in order for the mesh to animate well.  A poorly constructed model is going to look ugly no matter how the vertex weights are set.<br><br>I believe a specific example is in order here.  Imagine a tall cylinder.  The optimized static form would be no segments along its length, just vertices at the top and bottom.  This mesh would not work for an animation of the cylinder bending over however.  You need segments (ie. rings of vertices) along the cylinder's length.  The resulting animation would look better with blended vertex weights than rigid, but the geometry requirements are the same either way.  You cannot simply optimise the form without any thought to animation; the mesh must be designed in a way to facilitate animation. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The line quoted here, your explanation for the contect of your earlier statment, is exactly what I am reacting to.  One is NOT modeling free from restrictions.  Modeling for animation with blended vertex weights still involves a lot of restrictions.  In some cases fewer restrictions, but in some cases more restrictions, and in most cases pretty much the same restrictions.<br><br>Also, you wanted i.e, not e.g, but that's just nitpicking.

The general problem I was describing is of failing to segment polygons to allows correct creasing of the mesh.  In one recent example, a client sent me a model and asked me to animate it running.  The modeler however did not consider animation while modeling, so he didn't arrange the polygons correctly.  Specifically, there were single continuous polygons running up from about mid-thigh to the character's stomach.  In other words, there were no edges across the line where the leg meets the body.  Using blended vertex weights would not have changed the fact that the modeler would have to split the polygons at the top of the character's leg in order for it to animate correctly.<br><br>Anyway, there is a more fundamental thing to point out.  You say that "with rigid verts, you would have to position the verts differently."  Yes, rigid vertex weighting requires the modeler arrange vertices in a very specific way in order to facillitate animation.  I never disagreed with that.  However, you also said before that using blended vertex weights means the modeler no longer has to be careful laying out their vertices.  This is incorrect, and the key is your use of the word "differently."  Perhaps the required layout when using blended vertex weights is different (and this is not necessarily the case, but for the sake of argument I'll just go with that) but there is still a specific, required layout.  The restrictions have changed, but there are still restrictions, and plenty of them. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
