Now a beta is ready for your evaluation.<br><br>TerraForge is quite unique in that it does not allow you to directly edit the terrain; rather, it features a set of single click function that apply global changes to the terrain in a much easier, faster, and more realistic way than manual editing.<br><br>Generally you would start with some random "smart" noise to create a general purpose terrain. (In fact it just goes ahead and creates one on startup). Indeed, this may be good enough for your needs.<br><br>However, a plethora of single-click affects await you for modifying this base terrain. You can gouge it, stretch it, depress it, plump it, flip it, push it around, make an islend out of it, roughen it, smooth it, shrink it, grow it, and various others.<br><br>You can even use predefined macros; collections of commands that apply a series of affects that produce interesting results. For now, several macros are pre-loaded. The ability to make your own will come later.<br><br>When you are ready to save your work, go to the File menu and click Save. You will get a greyscale bitmap of the terrain and a color bitmap for the texture, saved right in the TerraForge directory, numbered with the next available number. A more sophisticated file saving routine will be added at some point.<br><br>Oh, the texture! This program (as yet unnamed) generates a texture selecting colors based on the height and slope of each point in the terrain. The default is one pixel per terrain vertex, but you can set that you much larger amounts; enough to lock up your computer for quite a while, so be careful! I find 4 to be a good setting for the final texture, and it takes about 30 seconds to create that texture on a 128 x 128 terrain.<br><br>However, if you set the terrain to something very high, like 1024 x 1024, and also set the texture density to a high level, you can expect to crash your computer or at least occupy its time for quite awhile.<br><br>Look in the Help menu for additional instructions.<br><br>send me some email at pbfreedm {at} yahoo.com with your thoughts and suggestions.<br><br><a href="http://www.lumpcat.com/files/TerraForge.zip" target="_blank">Get it here</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You can set radius to something like .9, which results in a steep island, but only at that distance, which is a little fake looking.  A better option is to create the island first, then run Plump the Hills and/or Reduce the Valleys a few times to get the look right.

I worked on it a long time as well but it wasn't perfect somehow.  I think it was just when I tried to display multiple copies in a grid (tiled) it gobbled up too much memory, or something like that.  I'll re-enable it and try to remember what the problem was.

I never wrote a writer but this should be easy. <a href="http://www.planetside.co.uk/terragen/dev/tgterrain.html" target="_blank">Here are the Terragen specifications</a>. The interesting part is that Terragen doesn't use the heights from 0...65535 or -32768 to 32767 in absolute values - it represents always all 65536 possible relative heights steps between the lowest and the highest value!<br><br>You can display a hill with a height of 1km with a precision of 2cm.

The climate for example - I'm still too dumb to create my own climate with matching textures - this could be improved a lot. Sometimes it is unstable and it costs money (will TerraForge be free?). Beside that I use Wilbur to create the terrains (which is free) and import them in L3DT to create the stunning textures. Wilbur has some nice fractal routines and tools to "paint" the terrain I miss in L3DT. But Wilbur is unstable, too.<br><br>In BlitzTiles, the Monkey Island scene is made with Wilbur and the Desert Mesas with L3DT. Zillertal Alps and Grand Canyon are converted SRTM data sets polished with L3DT. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

(a format compatible with most 3d systems without modification, .3ds I would think is most universally compatible?)   <br><br>Is .3ds less precise than the Terragen format?<br><br>If I'm going to require users to incorporate a special function to load TerraForge files, why not use .bmp but use the red and green bytes for high-order, low-order values and get 16-bit precision that way?<br><br>And yes, TerraForge will be free.<br><br>stayne: Wilbur and L3DT are impressive tools but really require reading detailed instructions to get going.  Wilbur tends to use a lot of technical terms that users won't know, while L3DT produces stunning results that are great for animations, but is really overkill for most games, and is not free.<br><br>TerraForge does away with all the technical jargon and creates the kind of terrains most actual games have; even high end games.  I notice they tend to avoid vast super realistic terrains, preferring to direct the players attention to the gameplay.  Still, the simple terrain should be as beautiful and natural-looking as possible.<br><br>The game designer should be able to run the program once, learn it by doing, and generate all the terrains they need for their game quickly and easily.  Really the macros should be the preferred method of construction.  Click.  Save.  Click.  Save.<br><br>Still I have a ways to go.  The single choice of color set in the texture is a big limitation (which I'm working on today...)   I'm trying to create a kind of 2d gradient represented by a square control in which the y-axis represents altitude and the x-axis represents slope.  The color at that spot represents the color that points with those features will be. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In terragen format I can store terrain sizes with 8192x8192 or higher very easy, in 3ds the detail would be very worse then (65536 vertex limit). But I could stream a part of the terragen terrain and convert it in runtime to a mesh.<br><br>It is only important if you want to save the heightmap with highest precision or use it in another application, and 8bit heightmap is not very precise. Sure you can use a 16 or 24 bit heightmap format in a bmp, the terragen format was only a suggestion because it is easy to handle, documented, standardized, using relative heights instead of absolute ones and can be imported by other applications (ex. L3DT, Wilbur). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
