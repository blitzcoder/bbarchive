Can you stick in a view like the previous demo where the camera is higher above the car?:<br><img src="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/config/img/tt.png"><br><br>[-] The handling of the car seems to be far more unforgiving than the previous demo.  Its too easy to lose control of the vehicle. It seems to skid for no apparent reason. Especially at higher speeds + turning. <br><br>To be fair though, tweaking the car settings helps.<br>I increased the suspension and lowered the ride height.<br>I found this gave the demo the 'feel' of the previous one.<br><br>[-] Can you speed up the time it takes for the TT image to scroll across (when you press SPACEBAR for example).

If not, maybe add a "+" &amp; "-" to each axis? Took me awhile to figure out I could apply both Accel &amp; Brake to Z-Axis, and that it was handled the way I wanted it too. <br>(where tilting axis forward accels, tilting it back brake/decell)<br><br>- No dead-zone setting for joystick/gamepad, it's a must for me<br><br>- Car accelerates freakishly fast when I tilt my right joystick (which I set to accel/brake) fully upwards from a stopped position, giving joystick/gamepad users a major advantage over keyboard users for reaching highscores<br><br>- Music for the menu would be nice, and possibly some low-key music during play<br><br>- Slamming the brakes while turning gives undesired results for me, I was expecting the vehicle to still turn slightly while slamming brakes, where from my experiance it ignores front-wheels, whether this is done on purpose or not I haven't concluded yet.<br><br>- Sliders would be very nice, beats inputting numbers, speaking of which, if you keep to input, possibly add numpad support? (didnt work for me with numlock on/off)<br><br>- This is just personal, but the game menu feels a bit lonely without a background image<br><br>- What Jim said regarding the TT image<br><br>Aside from that, love the progress so far though, has that real polished feeling in the actual game itself, looks really nice and clean, no disruptive graphics of any sort. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I liked the insane power (!) perhaps it needs pulling back a bit ?<br>On the braking and turning issue, if you lock the front wheels the car will not turn at all, i suspect you are doing this. I find if i lift off the brakes to let the wheels turn a little then steering becomes possible again.<br><br>@Geehawk : Wow, over all of the time i've been coding this, and the testing thats been done i've never seen a screenie like that! no idea what has caused the game to die in that fashion - any chance you could replicate it ?<br>Grouping pieces in the editor is another great idea - i'll look into having tabs down the side of the selection box for turns, etc<br>Price wise i had thought of around 10 euros / dollars.<br>Depends on the sort of feedback i get (i.e. this game is worthless or wow when is it out type comments!)<br>Also a friend of mine is working on a site where you can upload replays / records into a league, so i may have to fund this work !<br><br>thanks again for all your comments,<br><br>cheers<br><br>Mark <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Will certainly implement the link between track and record, so if its edited the records are re-set - also it never occurred to me that i will have to delete any saved replays for that track as they will become broken as well.<br>On the clashes front, i must have been fairly lucky because i usually got around 1 in 4 tracks with interference, but with a tiny bit of editing (i.e. inserting an extra turn) seemed to be able to fix most of them quickly anyway.<br>If i'm honest i don't think the random tracks are up to much, a human designed track always plays better, although they're OK for a bit of light relief (ooh-err matron)<br><br>cheers<br><br>Mark <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The flip flop see saw type thing has an offset hinge so as to return to the correct 'side' after the car passes, but the other physics pieces do not. They do have damping though, perhaps not enough - you must be really moving them !<br>I think i'll record their positions at start and then re-set them when the car is re-set - this should fix this problem.<br>As for having moving pieces (i.e. swinging platform) i had similar problems to yourself in that you could be on a fast time, but then encounter a tile in a bad position and it stuffs you through no fault of your own.<br>I'd prefer a driver to fail to beat a time due to bad driving rather than a random pieces positioning - thats imho - would you mind if some pieces were constantly moving ?<br><br>@both :  Thanks again for taking the time to comment.<br><br>cheers<br><br>Mark <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
