You earn money for fast laps and for the number of laps you complete at each circuit, if you carry on playing the game will return you to the first track after completing all three.<br><br>Money can be used to upgrade and repair your car in the pits.  Always keep some cash in reserve for repairs.  There is no car reset key so if you suffer a breakage you must get your car back to the pits.<br><br>Failures can happen at any time but are more likely to occur if you abuse your car.  The nature of failures will vary dependant upon your driving style and what aspects of the car you abuse the most.<br><br>Hot Rod Hottie features co'ckpit alteration of brake bias and fuel mixture controls, to my knowledge no other race game has ever simulated these before despite them being common controls for all race drivers.  If you do not understand them their default settings should suffice.  The anti-roll bar torsion is implemented but not configurable at the wheel at this time.  It can be configured in the pits by adjusting the suspension with which the physics currently has it tied.<br><br>Controls<br>======<br>~ or \ Bring up the joystick config panel, I am unsure how this performs with joysticks which accelerate &amp; brake on the same axis (feedback would be useful).<br><br>F1-F4 Camera Views<br><br>Cursor Up Accelerate<br>Cursor Down Brake<br>Cursor Left/Right Steering<br>Right Shift Gear Up<br>Right Control Gear Down<br><br>Page Up/Down Fuel Mixture<br>Insert/Delete Brake Bias<br><br>P Pause<br><br><br>Download<br>=======<br><a href="http://www.bansheestudios.com/ftp/HotRodHottie.zip" target="_blank">http://www.bansheestudios.com/ftp/HotRodHottie.zip</a><br><br><br>Frequently Asked First Question<br>======================<br>"Did I just blow my engine?"<br>Yes you did.<br>1st gear can only take so much.  To conserve your engine when it is running hot try changing up sooner, ease off the throttle during big jumps and turn the fuel mixture down (puts more air in the chamber, produces less power but less engine overrun).<br><br><br><br>This isn't a physics sim, it is meant to be auto-correcting during "moments" rather than realistic because in this sim you would find yourself upside down within the first 15 seconds of pulling away.<br><br>I've been working on this since last Friday so it doesn't have much spit and pollish.  I just wrote it to play with, i'm now going to return to my Waterworld project to get it ready for the next tournament.<br><br><br><img src="http://www.bansheestudios.com/img/HotRod1.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.bansheestudios.com/img/HotRod2.jpg"><br><br>Note to mods: Can the word co'ckpit when used in full please be removed from the word sensor.  It's such a commonly used word in games...<br><br>EDIT: I just uploaded a fix, it seemed I caught a key on one of the last compiles which changed a variable name and the lack of strict variable handling kind of messed things up.  The laptime cash reward was calculated at 0 seconds and that resulted in a payout of around half a billion pounds...  Anyway it's fixed now. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I think the steering phenomenon you are referring too is the way the game simulates slide.

If you think i'm insane for saying that, then errr, ok.  I do race cars for a hobby btw so I have a bit of an insight into the jargon... :)  Oh sure "hottie" could also meen a broad, therefore...<br><br>I intentionally avoided using a physics library because I wanted something more like skidmarks, maybe I should fix the camera in the corner of the map to make that point as it strikes me that point hasn't come across - and that's clearly an error in the game or I need to think very carefully about what the "target audience" wants.<br><br>If games need to be realistic now - and by realistic I meen the feel you get from physics wrappers rather than anything remotely real (as GT4 feels about as real to me as driving a very much simulated car with the very alien feel of a joypad) - then i'm clearly wasting my time making this.<br><br>That isn't a sarcastic way of me saying i'm right you're wrong, I meen it as it sounds.  I didn't want to write GenericCarFeeling01 game, I wanted something a bit different and I guess i'm pretty much alone in wanting that as the responses of this thread suggest very strongly that is not something most end users will want.<br><br>Race games need "accurate" (and I use the term jokingly in this instance) physics.  There is a feel that is required of race games and if it is absent then it's going to flop. This was important for me to (re?)descover and is the most positive thing I draw from this thread.<br><br>It has much wider ramifications than just race games too: Games players have expectations and woe be any game which forgets that.<br><br>At least it only took a weeks work to figure out, i'll start on something else soon - which may or may not be a race game. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You cant fix something if it isn't broken - and the problem here is my game is doing pretty much what I actually wanted it to do - save a few physics elements I hadn't got around to yet.  The problem here is the game concept - nobody wants unrealistic gameplay in first person, they want to know it's been written with a proper physics engine to get that generic "i've got a computer simulated race game" feel of realism that I personally loath.<br><br>I plan to carry on not making any attempts at a serious race game in the full knowledge I cant possibly hope to satisfy my own standards on the subject, but next time I attempt a fun driving game I wont make the mistake I did here of blurring the line to simulation and fix the camera very firmly in the corner and I will keep the physics very arcade gamelike so that the distinction is made.<br><br>It's either that or write a game with a physics engine to get that generic modern race game feel and pretend it's totally realistic and call it Gran Tourismo 4.  I'll be sure not to even manage to get the top speeds right and only allow play on a joypad, fail to comprehend what multi-link suspension does, miss-understand the term power to weight ratio and instead focus on top end torque as a measure of a cars straitline performance, and i'll modify the cars performance in their class based upon corporate sponsorship (and how many times I can get the player to say skyline in one sentence).<br><br>I may sound bitter, I guess maybe I am - but i'm angry at my own judgement for completely failing to capture any gameplay in something I produced.  I want to have a higher standard than that.<br><br>By this stage, in my idyllic world, a product with my name on it should show it's potential by now, and on the evidence of this thread this project doesn't have potential and instead has a list of complaints.  There's no "wow" factor, something i've too arrogantly grown accustomed too over the years, I needed to mess this up just to be reminded I dont have a middas touch.<br><br>The reason is simple:  I enjoyed playing with it myself and then I forgot to satisfy what people who play games actually want.<br><br>This game isn't broken, it conforms to it's design.
