You will find a lot of info &amp; instructions within the program itself, so do read it.<br><br>Be mindful: Theres a small bug that occurs rarely which will cause your target to not move horizontally and if you try move the source a black screen appears. Didn't have the time to track it down now, but it's rare anyway. I must be dividing something by 0, has to do with mouse movement. <br>Err... actually theres a few other small bugs but you'll live with them, maybe you won't even notice them!

Simple because you just have to move and shoot and your only 'enemy' is time. It's like clearing the screen with the mouse in a limited ammount of time. And complex because, well, using all the keyboard and having to remember which colour is each key...<br>I don't know, maybe it's just not my type of game - could be. I'd make the controls way more simple and add something that makes it more... active? moving atoms, comets that may hit you or the particles moving them away, some kind of radiation that changes the color of the particles, turbulences... I don't know, some things that makes it more challenging than standing there and passing the mouse over. However as it's only a prototype maybe you already thought of these - but I can't find it fun enough without them.<br><br>And well, the minimap idea is good and very useful, I like the movement... effects are not bad. In those aspects I don't have a complaint ;)<br><br>I hope not to offend you with my comments. English is not my first language and sometimes I sound rude when I'm not pretending to. It tries to be a constructive opinion.<br><br>Keep up the good work! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

They change colours in predictable ways and will try and eat other features so you need to kill em quick.<br><br>Feature 5: Sprayers<br>Rotating objects that spray particles of different colours. Once you hit the spray body a few times it disappears, you get points. <br><br>Feature 6: Fences<br>You cant move through these fences until you disable them. You have to hit multiple points with right colours (in little time) to disable the fence. Some come back on, some disappear forever<br><br>Feature 7: Codebox<br>You have to hit this box with particles of certain colour in certain order from certain angle :)<br><br>Feature 8: Bannana<br>it starts as one colour, as you hit it with the right colours it progresses thru the spectre, once it should reach where it was originally, it disappears<br><br>Feature 9: Source barrier<br>simple barriers that appear to have some 'noise' like broken tv, some of which is transparent sometimes. The player cant go thru them. They exist from point to point, no visible 'poles' to hold it up.<br><br>Feature 10: Particle barrier<br>Your particles cant go thru these.<br><br><br><br>I beleive that the combination of all these features will cause the player to think about the current situation and what to do first. Ie, an Eel is coming around and it will eat the cubes, should he disable the fence to get through for more points, kill the eel, or clear the cubes? There are many combinations i cant list them all now.<br><br><br>Overlapping text? But how? Doesnt matter.<br><br>Right now i'm considering my options on wether i should continue Nebulae or start making some 3d model packs for sale. The latter option is prevailing in me at the moment. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
