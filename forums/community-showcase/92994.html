I'll also reduce the firing speed for some of them, since I've gotten the too<br>many bullets complaint from some of my other playtesters. Collisions need to be<br>further refined, I want the baddies to be able to damage your shield when they<br>collide with it, and they definitely need to take collision damage as well.<br><br>As to explosions, I'm going to give different enemies their own unique explosions,<br>as well as making(maybe) it so explosions deal damage to anything they touch,<br>allowing you to take damage from them, and wipe out hordes of enemies by causing<br>an explosion 'chain'.<br><br>It's interesting that you though the sprites were too big.

Looks promising.  Adding sound effects will help it feel more like a shooter.<br><br>It seemed to throw me straight into the action with lots of ships and bullets.  I'd prefer to be gradually introduced to stuff to build up my skills.  Also, although the tilting to the side of the ship as you move is novel, it feels a bit weird.  Perhaps just facing up the screen and using a spreadshot will be good enough as it was for most other shooters, but don't let me put you off the tilting if you have a master plan for it.<br><br>The main menu and sub menus have giant text, I bet they would feel more pro with a smaller neater font.<br><br>Anyway, good job, I look forward to seeing it progress. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
