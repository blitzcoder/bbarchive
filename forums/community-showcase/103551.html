Just utilizing an "ID" (autogrowing) did not solve the problem as you just will forget resetting them in some cases :D.<br><br>Hmm, somehow I cannot come up with a real-world-example now for a problem with savegames I had during the last months.. maybe the most trouble came from the missing code split of "new game / loaded game" (so when starting a game I triggered certain things - which would not be needed if the game is a "loaded one" - like spreading around start items, or so).<br><br>So savegames are no problem for you - good thing.<br><br><br><br>@outlines<br>No I did not want you to remove the outlines - I just suggested it, as the background is smooth, the "tiles" are smooth, items like the crafting tools have smooth/faded outlines.<br>I understand that things like "selected tool"-symbols could have a outline but in your screenshots the character is a bit "heavier looking" - maybe your recoloring (or adding some "lighting/gradients" on the jacket/throusers) changes the appearance.<br><br>@plants<br>I just compared "plants" to the rest of the items - and if they have no use except "decoration" it is a good thing to have them in the "background", but as soon as they get useable in some way, they should be emphasized a bit. In my previous post I even did not suggest to change it ... I just asked if this was intentional or not ... so I do not get why the old man above quotes something from another one and puts my person into that context.<br><br><br>@poison basin<br>is the glow effect done using some kind of post processing - or just some tiles overlaying the whole thing?<br><br><br>@Character<br>Somehow he reminds me a bit on the "Hauptmann von Köpenick" (Heinz Rühmann). Maybe its the color of the suit .... NASA colors? Maybe you could "dirt" the suit later on ... it gets used, a bit dirty, broken, ... .<br>Like John Galt said: the player figure is the one you will see almost all time (same for earth tiles etc) so it needs more attention.<br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Escape-from-blocky-plant is a survival game and it should not too easy to survive :-)<br><br>@poison basin<br>The glow effect is done by layering two images on top of each other.<br>The front image is a simple 16x16 pixel image with alpha value of 0.6.<br>Behind that there is a rect image with a gradient drawn with SetBlend Lightblend. It was inspired by a "Metaball"-Demo I looked at some weeks ago.<br>The same technique is used drawing the lava. To have a better look lava is using some additional lights and particles.<br>I am not at home, so I can´t show you the gfx used by me.<br><br>btw. I am using the standard BlitzMax, without any mods or something.<br>So shader or real postprocessing effects are not possible for me.<br><br>@Character<br>It is planed to have some different clothes for the player. But he starts with his pilot uniform, because he bailed out of his spaceship just before gamestart. Later in the game you maybe find his crashed spaceship and perhaps you find some advanced tools and clothes ;-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
