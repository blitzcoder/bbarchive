I have a dual screen setup: both 19" with 1280x1024 (because this allows me to switch one screen of if not needed to save on power consumption). I did not like the bigger screen I got (full HD 23" - somehow I  prefer 4:3 or 5:4 to widescreen) - now my wife has to use it (2 days after I got it, her old screen broke apart :p).<br>Maybe my favor of 4:3/5:4 is the reason to extend the screen left/right-wise with some decoration when using widescreen (I saw some cas(h)ual games doing it this way).<br><br><br>@vibrant colors<br>Of course they are "strong" / saturated but a bit darker than the average casual games color - but they fit into the rest of the scenery, as your backgrounds are a bit darker / calm / night-ish which could find their audience too. This makes the "theme" a bit more serious, hope the upcoming buyers thought so too when clicking the "purchase" button :p.<br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I understand that "women in the 30-70" have a limited area of themes/gameplays they accept, so they wont like a solitaire game which enforces you to win to bring your rebellion forward against a enemy nations myrmidon (war scenery).<br><br>Maybe a title like "Lara Laboratory" sounds nice for a laboratory/chemical-themed match3 with plenty of ideas for metagames might find some fans (albeit I doubt match3 to be that success nowerdays - there are plenty of them and I do not understand why I should own some dozens of them :p).<br><br>I do not know how well "unwell mel" (you said it was some kind of "serious" themed) run in the past .. but maybe women would like to see some more serious themes/settings than just "uber-cuteness". Maybe a game about a children's home in the late 19th century, British ... "Save a pence". So the player has to help some children versus the draconic director.<br><br>In a French themed setting you could play with the tourism at the Eiffel tower, there shouldn't be someone offended. Another "french" themed thing is "Louvre"-&gt;Art-&gt;Thieves/... maybe some humorous story about a couple of thieves (or to attract more women: mother and daughter thieves). Such things have of course enough potential of minigames.<br><br>American themed things - if you are not afraid of being an "anti-native-people"-developer - is the North American settings of the the pilgrim fathers. I think women "enjoy" stories about women gaining power in different styles (political, in marriage, ...). Maybe a game about the "survival of the fittest" centered around a family which lost the father?<br><br>I do not know if above ideas are already used in commercial "successful" apps as I just tried to think a bit about it (while typing, so no deep thoughts). Even if they are used somewhere - just think further and expand ideas until you reach something new ... french thieves already exist? Why not expand into smugglering? I can assume that women would like to play a clever but sometimes bad-ass young female ruling over her myrmidons and outsmarting the police from time to time.<br><br><br><br>@Pingus<br>Sorry for derailing the thread.
