I think it can be done much better, it's still looking way too synthetic. Maybe a better skybox would help to make it look more natural.<br><br>Yes, my code is a little slow although it's running smootly on my radeon 9200se. One solution to make it a lot faster would be to use a smaller terrain (64*64 instead) and a surrounding ocean plane with a simple animated texture. A hole in the middle of the plane (or plane-like mesh), made with vertex alpha, would then show the water terrain in the center of the scene.<br><br>I don't think water has to be transparent as long as you're in deep water. Only when you're near the coast and you actually would see the ground then you may play with transparency. But even here I'd rather try to use a seamless stony texture with texture wobbler to fake the user thinking he can see the (distorted) stones on the ground.<br><br>BTW Texture Wobbler was released a long time ago. It was in the news, tho people missed it kind of. It drops MAVs  on some machines, no idea why.<br><br>The idea of Texture Wobbler is nice, but if I'd rewrite it, I would use a fine mesh with realtime vertex deformation to achieve sin/cos distortion, and not the simple Copyrect Routine that was used in the current Release. I mean, this CopyRect thing was developed for realtime purposes (see code archives).<br><br>There was one problem with cubemapping: I felt like it's hard to mix a cubemap with a second texture layer. So I decided to add that sunglasses thing, so the cubemap cameras would see things darker than they are. Additionally the EntityColor Command is used to adjust the influence of the second (non cubemap) texture layer. well, that wasn't absolutely correct: layer 0 is the animtexture and layer 1 is the cubemap. For some reason entitycolor didn't affect the cubemap texture.<br><br>Now common, gimme some water! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You have to. Copyentity is creating an instance of an existing Mesh. while editing the original Mesh will affest the instances as well, each instance can be positioned individually.

You can make a dynamic mesh and calculate each triangles angle in relation to the camera/scenery and those which are at a higher angle could reflect more. Of course you'd have to control the amount of reflection by other texture layers. You could do 1 render only with reflections, add blur to it (and hide others while blurring), then show the rest of the normal water with colour and texture maps. Also, a table of geometry of verts could be established so you can check positions just by angle of camera (if you have same water-wave tiles scattered around) and it wouldnt be that cpu intensive. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

As an off product, the water wave ripples are actually written to the skybox, not as actual 3d water.  We looked at how nVidia did the realistic day/night cycles and just recreated the idea for water.  The fact remains though that it is the sky box's textures that are being altered - it is not 3D water.  So, it is 3D water being rendered in 2D then being mapped out as 2D.

I was afraid that people had given up, but I guess they were just out programming.<br><br><br>Inarie: Your demo is very nice. The whitecaps are excellent, the waves are very smooth, and the frame rate is surprisingly good considering that the water mesh is created every frame. With some more optimization, I bet it could be way faster, too :)<br><br><br>Fredborg: Your water demo also really impressed me. Good framerate, the reflections are marvellous, and the waves appear quite smooth when they're set right. I notice that the reflections are a bit funny looking when up close to the duck, but it looks like this is probably just the fault of the demo. I love how I can set the cubemap to be blurred to get smoother waves. The reflections bottom out in some cases, but this isn't a contest about reflections and it seems like the problems are easily avoided. (Besides, computer game water always looks best from a distance). Why is the entire water engine in the "Cube_Reflection01.bb" file? It's a bit of a strange name, if it has the wave update stuff...<br><br>For now, my vote is for Fred's water. The reason is because his demo doesn't require to remove vertices that are below the water, there are many fun options available to the programmer, and because I like ducks.<br>Amazing job! Including to those who I didn't vote for... I couldn't possibly achieve some of the water that's been posted up here.<br><br><br><br>I'll be mightily impressed when someone throws in a bit of alpha like in Halo's screenshot up above here. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Besides I congratulate you for arranging this competition jfk EO-11110.<br><br>By the way as I am very busy I can not attend to your conversations that much :( sorry.<br><br>my vote goes to the sea of fredborg (fredborg  how would you do the reflection if you were to put two ducks in your scene)<br><br>@dock<br><br>yes you are right about the reflection. I had to make a choice here. There are 16 columns an done pool on the scene. I could have done the reflection by making cubed map one by one for all and opening private sections underneath. However this would not be effective besides making the thing cumbersome. Besides I would also make a reflection render with reference to the  angle of the camera and then would map the object projectionally with reference to the angle of the camera. ( In fact I do not know whether there is the utility of projectional mapping with reference to the camera in blitz) besides if I would do raytrace reflection instead of cubed refle there would not be a problem. ( but as far as I know there is no raytrace reflection in blitz)<br>I preferred leaving considering all these. Besides for such objects, in the interior scenes, cubed refle can be pleasant but for planary objects, although cubed refle is done for all objects cutting the planary object separately, as zonal mapping is necessary, there will be reflection differences between the zones. ( I would appreciate if you have further ideas)<br>As a result I decided to leave the refle as this, both in an effective and satisfactory speed.<br><br>@Mustang<br><br>I used the caustic only to increase the strength of the effect. If you remove the austic from the I source you will probably see the water effect you want. And with this caustic is usually more in the areas with more light. The caustic of reflection being in the exploding parts of the light is normal as it is again the reflection of light. In this situation, in my scene, there would be caustic in the columns on which the light was more instead of being on the ceiling. But I disregarded this as the caustic on the columns would not add much to my scene. The reflection of caustic on the ceiling is a fact directly proportional with height between the ceiling and water. At this scene less caustic should have been added and to a definite part of the ceiling. However, it would not add much to the frame ( I tried).<br><br>I thing many of you had the problem between (geforce 2 / 4mx)and (geforce fx). My main concern why the multiply2 parameter did not work in geforce 4 mx and  gf2 when we made texture blending.<br><br>@ Inarie<br><br>As I basiclly aimed to capture the photoreality  the code had been a little interesting you are right <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
