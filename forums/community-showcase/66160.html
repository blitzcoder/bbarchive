<table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr ><td class="posthead"><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr ><td >Trixx</td><td align="right"><font class=tiny>(Posted 2007)</font>&nbsp;<a href="#1">[#1]</a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr ><td class="posttext"> Finally, after almost 1.5 years of development, here is the first public beta of IDEal - IDE for Blitz.  I hope that you will like it, because I put a lot of hard work in it's development... Just as the name implies, IDEal is meant to be ideal editor for blitz programmers...  I set myself a goal to release it by the end of 2006, so here it is, one day after deadline :)<br><br>The most advanced features of IDEal :<br><br>1. IDEal is FAST, really fast.. besides all the advanced features, IDEal IMHO is the fastest blitz editor.<br>- Loading time of the IDE -  1-1.5 seconds, depends on the current layout, number of userlibs etc..<br>- Loading, Parsing and Highlighting of the file with 15000 lines of code - 1 second ! ( on P4 2.4Ghz, 1GB RAM, Win XP )... Files with 2000-3000 lines of code are opened instantly.<br><br>2. REAL-TIME STRICT emulation - IDEal will highlight ( default in RED color ) all undeclared/misspelled variables immediately as you type ! <br>Missed/ unmatched braces are also highlighted as bad. Many syntax errors will be immediately visible also ! <br><br><img src="http://www.fungamesfactory.com/screenshots/ideal1.png"><br><br>3. Powerful highlighting and parsing engine, additionally to keywords, numbers , separators... will recognize and highlight inbuilt functions, globals, locals, labels - all of them can have separate font/style/color ! So , no need to create decls files anymore (except for DLL's) . Just include your library in the project and IDEal will recognize all functions, global variables, constants, labels... and color them as you like. They will also be included in autolists and intellisense.<br><br><img src="http://www.fungamesfactory.com/screenshots/ideal6.png"><br><br>4. Totally customizable.. you can fully customize menus, toolbars, layout, but most importantly, you can customize context menu and all shortcuts. You can even customize<br>basic commands like Line down, line up, new line etc. :) There are also plenty of options to customize editor behavior.<br><br>5. Advanced Smart Project wide intellisense for types/fields. Intellisense lists will popup automatically, and they will offer ONLY fields that are valid for that keyword/variable/function !<br> example: If you type 'Goto' list will popup with only labels , or after keywords like 'New' , 'Each' , 'Object' ... list will popup with only types... after "type" variables, it will offer only fields that belong to that type etc.<br><br>6. Advanced smart autocomplete system... IMHO Autocomplete is essential coding help, but many programmers don't use it because it is annoying popup most of the time. Now, in IDEal , you can really control how autocomplete works, when to popup, what to popup etc. so it can be your best friend which will drastically reduce typing time and chances for typing errors !<br>And, most importantly, autocomplete can include all your inbuilt functions, labels, variables and constants ! Project wide of course.<br>It is also smart, so in some particular function, it will include Local variables only from that function ! It also won't show up if there is no need for that - for example after 'Global' keyword.<br>- You can limit the minimum number of characters needed for autocomplete window to popup.. so it won't popup on short words like If, For, End etc.<br>- You can limit autocomplete to popup only when there is no more than X matches in the list, so it won't popup and offer 50 matches that begins with 'a' when you type just 'a' <br>- You can limit length of the words that will show in the list, so short words like If, Then, End, For, Next ( which are easier to type then to choose from the list ) won't be unnecessary included in the list<br> Example : If you have several variables like LongVariableNameX , you can limit the minimum length of words to be 10 and choose autocomplete to not include blitz keywords, then after typing just 'L' you can manually invoke autocomplete list which will offer only your variables that has names longer than 10 characters and begins with 'L' .<br>As in this example, you can set your autocomplete to be invoked manually or automatically as you type. You can also choose FillUp characters ( those that will complete the word automatically ) and Stop chars ( those that will immediately hide the autolist ).<br><br>7. Advanced AutoIndent system will fully autoindent code as you type ! This will reduce the number of TAB presses several times :)<br>Example:<br>For i=1 to 10<br>   For k=1 to 5<br>      a=a+1<br>   Next<br>Next<br>For the above code, you don't need to press tab even once ! Just type the lines and IDEal will increase/decrease indent automatically.<br>Additionally, files can be autoindented automatically on load, you can autoindent blocks of code, and of course, you can switch to standard simple autoindenting seen in other editors.<br><br>8. Powerful auto correct of variable/function casing - When you change variable casing in it's declaration, IDEal will change casing of all occurrences in whole project, not only the newly created ones.<br>Example: If you have 'Global Myvariablename=1" and change that to "Global MyVariableName=1" , ALL occurrences of Myvariablename will be immediately changed to MyVariableName .<br><br>9. Unlimited number of compilers - you can define as many compiler / versions of compiler in IDEal as you like. Each opened file can have different compiler and you can switch between compilers almost in no time. <br>Example : You can install ten different versions of B3D ( lets say 1.77, 1.83, 1.89... 1.95 ) and compile your code with anyone of them in a matter of seconds - no need to reinstall different versions of B3D just to see if your code will work with some other version or not... Of course, same applies for B+ and old B2D<br><br>10. Instant( realtime ) function help with parameter highlighting - no need to call help, help tips appears in status bar automatically when cursor is over function/parameter<br>  Function /parameter help additionally can also be opened as calltips in small window below current edited line.<br><br><img src="http://www.fungamesfactory.com/screenshots/ideal3.png"><br><br>11. Code Browser - Multiple levels Code browser will allow you to go to Previous/Next position and works globally, i.e. positions can be in different files. You can customize it's behavior, default to remember position whenever you edit something<br>Example:  Type something, Scroll to some line, type something, Jump to some definition, type something there, then again jump to definition, and the go back, then again back, then again back to the first position ! From there you can again just go Next, Next, Next and you will be again to the last position ... <br>Code Browser will speed up your moving across your project and decrease the need for bookmarks.<br><br>12. HotCodes - HotCode is abbreviation for longer, aka 'real' code, you can define as many as you like and you can expand hotcodes to 'real' code with shortcut.<br>example : type SBBB press shortcut and SBBB will instantly be replaced with SetBuffer BackBuffer() <br> HotCodes are very useful for longer Variable/Functions names :  type MLV, press CTRL+ENTER ( default shortcut ) and you get MyLongVariableName ( or whatever you defined for 'MLV')<br>HotCodes can be as short as one char and replacement i.e. real code can be as long as you like, including whole function for example...<br>Of course, you can edit HotCodes, Assign HotCode for selection etc. You must agree that this can accelerate typing a lot ! Using abbreviations also reduces number of typing mistakes.<br><br>13.. Layouts ( aka perspectives ) - save and restore different layouts with just a key press, like for example - you can switch between all docking windows open and full screen editor layout with just a keypress.<br><br>14.  IDEal will remember all bookmarks and folding states of files when you close them, so the next time files will be opened in exact same state, i.e. with bookmarks, lines that were folded will be folded again etc. So,  no need for everytime to FOLD/UNFOLD certain functions or add bookmarks... Additionally, last used compiler, last used command line is also remembered... IDEal embed those info in the file itself, so it won't create any additional files.. file that is saved on this PC, can be opened on another PC in the same state ( If it's opened in IDEal of course :) )<br><br>15. Workspaces - Workspace is all your opened files/projects  ... you can save workspace and restore later, you can load last active workspace ( aka 'load last opened files' ) , but you have total control over it..<br>Example: If you have your project open and close the editor, workspace will be automatically saved . Next time when you open IDEal, you can open last automatically saved workspace, some other previously saved  workspace ( maybe some other project ) or simply open new file and you can load the workspace anytime later. Workspace will remember which files/projects were opened and their exact order on the ' Tabs line' , any splited windows, grouped windows etc...<br><br><img src="http://www.fungamesfactory.com/screenshots/ideal5.png"><br><br>16. Global bookmark system - standard bookmarks may work globally across all open files - i.e. pressing next bookmark will bring you to the next bookmark in other file<br><br>17. Help Browser can have multiple help files opened in separate tabs and all of them are again separate from the main files tabs, so multiple opened help tabs won't mess with other files tabs.  One handy function in Help Browser is "Back to Code" which  will get you back to the place where you invoke help command.<br><br><img src="http://www.fungamesfactory.com/screenshots/ideal4.png"><br><br>18. Find and Replace works with files, all opened files, project wide search, Find Next, Find Previous, Wrap search, Start searching from cursor or from Top of the file<br><br>19. Various Drag &amp; Drop support - starting from dragging and dropping between opened files up to dragging and dropping between IDEal and other programs, between File Explorer and Editor etc. Files and Folders in Snippet explorer and in Project explorer can be arranged with dragging and dropping... IDEal will open files /group of files that is dropped from windows explorer  etc etc...<br>  <br>20. Very low CPU / Memory usage... Massive Project with 80.000 code lines needs only 30MB of RAM <br><br>There are plenty more nice features , but I'll mention just some of them that are not so common in other editors :<br><br>- Snippets manager<br>- File Explorer together with explorer context menu and favorites folders / files , to speed up access to your files<br>- Code Folding - Functions, Types and Custom blocks of code<br>- Second type of comment with different color/style, used, for example to mark more important comments in the code.<br>- Multiple instances of IDEal, Brace Highlighting inside braces, Indent highlighting on Scope keywords, Cutting/Deleting/Moving up -Down of whole lines etc, Line wrapping, 6 different user interface styles, Split window functionality  etc... <br><br>NOTE: This is the first beta of IDEal, so probably there are bugs left... and it's tested on Win98 and XP, so anyone with Vista, please report if everything works fine under Vista ?<br>Several functions ( like Print/preview ) are not available yet, and also several other features ( Auto backup, To-Do list, Media files in code explorer... ) are planned to be implemented soon. BMax is not supported currently, and I don't know if it will ever be.<br><br>Happy New Year !!! .. and Please provide me with some feedback, bug reports, feature requests etc.<br><br>Edit: Go to www.fungamesfactory.com to download the latest release <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There are also several IDEs for BMax available or in development, so I don't know if BMax users want another one. Even if IDEal can offer something that others can't / won't offer, I see many users are satisfied with the default IDE ( even with B3D's one ) i.e. people that somehow don't need/use advanced features , so I don't want to make a BMax version just for ten or twenty people. <br>Anyway, if people like this IDE, I can reconsider adding BMax support. And I'll certainly add support for BMax when I myself switch from B3D to BMax :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I was afraid of them, because this is the first public release. So far, so good :)<br><br>@mindstorms: I will look into the taskbar issue, I didn't notice that because I always work with my taskbar visible<br><br>@OJay: about autoindenting, comments should work fine, the only case where autoindent will fail is if you are using IF statements without 'Then'... I will write separate post for this, please check if this is the case for you?<br>About your code showing in red, as mindstorms already explained ( Thanks for that ) , you are probably not declaring your local variables. If that is the case, just put regular color for 'Bad text' in your color scheme.<br><br>@boomboom - Yes, I know about the missing icon for the 'includes' , because IDEal will not list your includes in this version, so that space is reserved for future because I don't know if people will ask for that.<br><br>@Warren  1. I'll look into the project bug, thanks for reporting it.<br>2. About the second monitor issue, It will take some time to look into it, because I don't have second monitor now to test it. <br>3. This issue will be solved for the next release.<br>4. You can turn off embedding info about the file in the file itself ... from 'Editor setting'  -&gt; 'For each file remember' ... deselect all<br>I think that it is better to save these info together with the file, instead of creating additional files for each file, but maybe this option should be off by default, sorry for not mentioning it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you associate .bb files with IDEal, there are ten different icons to choose from for the .bb files - look into the ICONS folder !<br><br>4.

I decided not to built any kind of plugin system, simply because it's not worth it. Why ? <br><br>Because it's much easier for the developer itself to add certain feature directly in core code, than to some user through plugin, so instead of spending at least 2+ weeks on creating such system, I will add every feature that people want ( which can be added through plugin system)  for that time. And adding of that functionality directly in main code will make it to behave much faster in it's operation.  Also adding support for new language like BMax with Plugin won't be possible, or it will be slow as hell...  Plugin system, like you said, will also require modularizing code, and that will slow down a lot of operations in IDEal, and I don't want that to happen :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you are looking at some function and want to look at some global variable, you need to scroll down, open node, scroll down... Then, if you want to go back to that function, you again need to scroll up... With ListBoxes, Just click on globals, type the name of that global variable.. and when you go back to functions, your function is selected, no need to search for it again.<br>At the end , you don't need to touch your mouse to work with listboxes... press shortcut for functions, type the name for that function, press ENTER ... <br>IMHO treeview is better only for smaller projects.. anything bigger and it becames a real pain to find what you are looking for.<br><br>Now, we can't have both treeview and listboxes, because that will slow down realtime refreshing, but if most of the users want treeview, I can replace listboxes with treeview.<br>Tell me what you ( and others ) think about this ?<br><br>@mindstorms: Adding folding option for all scope keywords is not hard, it was even implemented in one alpha version, but folding margin looks messy with folding signs on "every second line"... additionaly 'fold/unfold all ' commands becames unusable in a way ( to many different commands ) ... And too many folding points will slow down certain operations... Remembering of folding states will start to be a problem and several other things that I didn't like, So, I was thinking that custom foldable blocks will be sufficient. But , if this is crucial for you, it'll be implemented in the future... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Why doesn't it start me immediately in a code window so I can start tying my latest blockbuster game straight away? <br></div><br><br>There will be an option for this soon, keep in mind that 90% of the time, you don't want to start a new file, but to continue your work from the previous day.<br><br><div class="quote"> can i get it to automatically put a wend statement below the new line I'm working on? <br></div><br>Yes, press shortcut for 'Complete Scope' .. I already explained why editor should not do it automatically.<br><br><div class="quote"> I've then commented the first if statement. The second if statement has unindented. If I now uncomment the first if statement, the indenting on the second if statement stays wrongly unindented. <br></div><br>There must be a limit up to which autoindent will try to help you.<br>Imagine that you have a function with 1000 lines and want to type For ... /Next statement at the beginning... Now, IDEal would need to Indent whole function after the FOR statement ( because it doesn't know where the NEXT statement will be ) , and Unindent the whole function after the NEXT statement... Hmm, read the number 1 feature of my first post :)<br>So, whenever you need to correct indentation in the lines that are not new or just edited, just press 'Autoindent current function' or 'Autoindent selection' and there you go !<br><br><div class="quote"> Also, after I typed the code above, I noticed the indenting characters seem wrong. The if statements do not show the indenting with a "-&gt;", instead with a "|" which is fine as it shows me my if-endif block. <br>I then turned on "show whitespace", the indents don't change. I select a few lines of the code and block comment it and the indents change to "-&gt;". <br>This now indicates to me that the "|"'s are only for if-endif type blocks, and the "-&gt;" are for other tabs.When I then tab in a line by several tabs I get lots of "|"'s which don't match codeblocks. I think it should be "-&gt;" characters for tabs except when it matches a code block where they should be "|"'s  <br></div><br><br>-&gt; sign is used to show tabs when in 'show whitespaces' mode, but indentation is different than tabs, i.e. indentation is not counted as tabs. If this bothers you, I think I can change this behavior. But are you sure that too many arrows at beginning of every indented line will not hurt your eyes?<br>When you commented your code, indentation is converted in tabs because you have " ; " at the very beginning of every line.<br><br>@hockings: I see that you just started using IDEal... I would be grateful if you come back later and tell me if everything is ok after several hours of using it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This only happens when I have changed something in the code in your editer when it is maximized.  Minimizing it fixes the problem.  Even having it maximized behind say visual studio, the startbar still does not work.  I do not know how this is happening, but it is still annoying. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I hope my comments will be helpful to you.<br><br>1) I think there should be a configure blitz path dialog on first run of ideal<br><br>2) Forget my comment about the multiple "|"'s that you can indent lines by, I didn't realise that the line resets back to where it should be when you press enter or an arrow key<br><br>3) The auto intent selection/function option is easy enough to run when you've commented, then uncommented sections. Would it be a good idea perhaps to make it so that an "uncomment block" also auto indents the function if you're using autoindent? Just a thought... <br>INDEed uses a technique where it polls the code every few seconds and adjusts case etc then. Personally I much prefer the way yours works doing it straight away.<br><br>4)I've removed the default Blitz3D194 compiler and created my own (blitz). The pulldown to select my compiler on the main editor window still has Blitz3D194 which no longer exists.<br><br>5) When configuring the compiler, it has a text box where I can type the path to the compiler and help files. If I edit these by hand, click apply, close the window then go back in, my changes are gone. The changes work if I browse to the folder rather than typing changes by hand.<br><br>6) when I run my code and it hits an error, I would _REALLY_ love to see the cursor move to the function and line that had the error automatically.<br><br>7) Normal behaviour when I click the currently open app on the windows askbar is that it minimises it. When I do that on IDEal, it stays maximised but looses focus. Shouldn't it minimise?<br><br>Again, a brilliant editor! Many thanks to you!!!<br><br>(What did you write it in by the way please?) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Current File/Project selection for CodeExplorer - 'Current File' mode will show items in the code explorer only from the active file, and 'Project' mode from the whole project. These two modes are same for single files, because each single file is also a project.<br><br>3. Option - " CTRL-Tabbing starts with previous active file "  will work only if the shortcut for "Next File Tab" command contains CTRL as a modifier, i.e. all CTRL+some key variations . So, you can easily have two different versions of the "Next File Tab" command if you enable this option and assign two different shortcuts for it - one with CTRL as a modifier and the other with some other modifier ( like SHIFT, ALT ) or without modifier.<br><br>And, sorry if anyone was expecting 'Includes' in the Code Explorer, they will be in the next bigger update.<br><br>Cheers! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Thanks for your kind words... As Reactor said, and you probably agree, the most important thing is to finish the B3D/B+ version first, which may take some time.<br>I was thinking about BMax, and the problem with BMax version is the lack of motivation for doing it in this moment.<br><br>Also, I have several projects ( games ) in B3D that are put on hold just because at some point, development started to be boring because I started to lose so much time because of lack of certain features in the IDE I was using, and because of the not so good B3D debugger ( no Stop/Edit/Continue functionality ).<br><br>So, my next project that I have motivation for is a powerful B3D interpreter / debugger, but that will probably never be publicly released. I'm sure that a debugger like in Visual Basic will speed up the development of my other B3D projects VERY much. If BMax had such a debugger, I would replace B3D with BMax immediately, and of course make a BMax version of IDEal :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
