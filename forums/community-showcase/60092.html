Slide the cars around so that you can get the white car to the exit on the right hand side of the screen. 40 levels, getting more and more difficult as you go, and believe me some of the later levels will take some seriously hard thinking, but they are all possible.<br><br><img src="http://www.glimmergames.com/images/games/carjockey/screen1.jpg"><br><br><a href="http://www.glimmergames.com/downloads/carjockeysetup.exe" target="_blank">DOWNLOAD HERE! ( 2.5MB )</a><br><br>DX8 is required.<br><br>Please post specs and the contents of the game.log file if you're reporting any problems. F1 displays FPS, but I can't imagine something this basic is going to cause FPS problems anywhere. Most modern machines are probably gonna max out at 999FPS. If it's not smooth, try enabling VSync, but in my experience, enabling VSync made it much LESS smooth so it's off by default. Depending on the results of the beta, I might even disable that option altogether, but it may be useful for some setups, so it's there for now. Any tearing, or glitches, any audio problems, I need to know about those. <br><br>I'm not going to redesign all the graphics or make it into something it's not.. it was only ever going to be a four week project, and that's about how long it's taken with all my other personal and work commitments. So I'm mainly interested in bugs, glitches, anything like that which needs to be resolved. Any showstoppers. I *MIGHT* consider changing the longer car graphics, but I've yet to find anything else which looks good and fits with the concept when viewed top-down like this. I tried trucks and buses but they look out of place and don't really belong in a car park anyway.<br><br>No immediate plans for a Mac version ( sorry ) because I'm using a couple of things which would be difficult to port. Mainly the particle system, and use of compressed textures. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It starts up the engine as soon as you put the car in place, but there is a pause before it starts moving so that it fits in properly with the sound.
