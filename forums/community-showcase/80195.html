I've played many time Candy World and it still fun... I'm not joking its replayable even for me !<br><br>Every corner of every game is reviewed now... for maximum gameplay and fun... I will translate both game in Leadwerks to help support DirectX10... It will be free anyway !<br><br>I'm projecting two Candy World games / two Dreams games...<br><br><u>Candy World Adventure</u><br>a 2d adventure game made in the spirit of Candy World and Save Candy... Candy must discover a way to get rid of Dr. Picpic who kidnapped Her friends... She must meet Toopy to get helped in the mission... Only Candy and Toopy will be playable... All of Candy Bones, Crescent, Hearth and Golden Bones are back !!! The challenge will be simple at the beguining and will get harder as the game gets far...<br><br><u>Hearth of Candy World : Hype of Heaven</u><br>Is the real story of Candy and Toopy presented as an RPG and a plateformer... Candy and her friends will have to visit and live 7 times of their live and it will be more like a story... But there will have good plateforming elements never seen in a game before.<br><br><u>Legends of Dreams : Tides of Aquarius</u><br>The LOD like MMORPG... Is based on LOD but with more world, more characters and class... It will be online !<br>Also callen LODO and look like AION (a NCSoft MMORPG)<br><br><u>Dreams : The Rebirth</u><br>Is the game we will make this year and is also a MMORPG but is more epic like Fable... I will only be a programmer for this game... We'll have a professionnal modeller, musician and writter... Is the official game made for Intel... no joke indeed !<br><br>This is all of the actual and future game i'm working on, They are going to get out throught 2009...<br><br>As promised, LOD and CW will be free forever... They will be updated very often... The decision is Final and we will not come back on the decision like before ! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
