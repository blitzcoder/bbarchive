In its time, Senet was exceptionally popular.  Many pharaohs and other wealthy people were even buried with Senet boards.  It wasn't restricted to the wealthy people either.  They've found boards crudely scratched into blocks in pyramids, suggesting that the workers may have been playing during breaks and such.  Later in its reign of popularity, a certain mystique was formed about the game that suggested that people who were good at it were favored by the gods.<br><br>Unfortunately, since it was so pervasive in their culture, nobody bothered to write down the rules.  Scholars have made educated guesses and came up with a few different rule sets.  I cherry-picked the best ideas from each, and made my own variation.  <br><br>I have modernized the game to make it appeal to today's gamer.  It features network play, both Mac and Windows versions, sound and music, and some unlockable features.<br><br>I'm looking for whatever constructive feedback and bug findings you're willing to provide.  You can download the beta versions from the links below.  Right now there's a Windows and a PowerPC Mac version available.  They expire on January 31st.<br><br>Windows - <a href="http://jhanson.com/downloads/Senet-Setup.exe" target="_blank">http://jhanson.com/downloads/Senet-Setup.exe</a><br>Mac (PPC only at the moment) - <a href="http://jhanson.com/downloads/Senet.dmg" target="_blank">http://jhanson.com/downloads/Senet.dmg</a><br><br>Also, here's a screenshot for you so you know what you're getting into:<br><br><img src="http://jhanson.com/images/screenshots/senet.jpg"> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I posted the MaxMod tweak over on Grey Alien's forum.<br><br>Also, a couple of updates from the beta process so far:<br><br>1.  A Windows user mentioned that Avast anti-virus thinks that the installer package is a virus.  This is a false positive.  For some reason the latest Avast thinks that anything packaged with Inno Setup is a virus.  I'm looking into alternate installer packages since this seems to be a recurring theme with Avast and Inno, but the current package is safe to use.<br>2.  I'm working on a second beta to improve a few details, including making it more obvious when the player has unlocked a new feature, and to fix the one bug that has been reported so far.<br><br>Finally, some questions about how you like the game.<br><br>1.  I'm looking for any comments you may have on the sound and particle effects.  Are they good as is or are they distracting or lacking in any way? <br>2.  Is the AI challenging enough?  Too challenging?<br>3.  How is the networking?<br>4.  Do the instructions make sense? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The glyphs and symbols also look pretty good, although there may still be a bit of sexup potential.<br><br>The background as well as the the green and blue blobs are poor. They are looking like placeholders.  don't know what possibilites the bmax game framework offers (probably only 2D), but I'd say it's such a waste to use such an excellent game idea, with a lot of cult potential, with such cheapo graphics. Hope you don't mind, I am very direct here. I can even see the Photosop filter you applied to the blobs.<br><br>Now, what I would expect, and what would make this game a possible game in stores, is top graphics that will take the player to an other world, the ancent world of egypt, with mystic atmosphereical graphics, cutscenes and things (may have a look at filax egypt demo, for instance). 3D render abilties would help here a lot.<br><br>I Hope you take this as it was meant: constructive critism. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Basicly I'd say: maybe it doesn't have to be wood (only). You may also think about the classic egypt top materials, such as marble, gold, lapislazuly. (tut's cap with the gold/blue stripes...)<br><br>Searching for images about "egypt" and "inlay" on yahoo also gives some nice results, although one should not confuse islamic inlay and wood artwork with ancient egyptian artwork: http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images;_ylt=A9G_bHIpsJNHo0oBSA6JzbkF?p=egypt+inlay&amp;y=Search&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=yfp-t-501&amp;fp_ip=CH&amp;x=wrt&amp;js=1&amp;ni=21<br><br>For the blue and green "blobs" I would suggest to use Topas (as seen here: <a href="http://www.gemtrade.de/contents/de/d266.html" target="_blank">http://www.gemtrade.de/contents/de/d266.html</a> ) and probably Smaragd as seen here: <a href="http://www.gemtrade.de/index.html?lang=de&amp;target=d239.html" target="_blank">http://www.gemtrade.de/index.html?lang=de&amp;target=d239.html</a><br>but you may of course browse the other gemstones as well, some of them are real cute. You may however prefer round shapes since brilliant cuts aren't accurate egypt historic culture.<br><br>BTW one further point is: you should try to avoid mixing multiple fonts whenever possible. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I don't want it popping up every time you go to click on a pawn, but I want it to show up after a reasonably short delay.  I think it's going to end up being about 0.8 seconds instead of the 1.0 seconds that's in the current build.  Doesn't sound like much of a change, but it makes a big difference.<br><br>As for the track layout, I was trying to keep to the traditional Senet board shape.  I may include a different shape as an unlockable feature, though, since it's simple enough to do.<br><br>With the animated moves/jumps, I ended up going with the little particle effects rather than a piece sliding across the board type animation after a lot of trial and error.  I just couldn't get it to look natural, so I decided to go with the supernatural zap/teleport type thing.  It kept ending up looking really mechanical to me for some reason.  Even when I got it looking a little more human, it ended up looking a little too "Hasbro" and not mystical enough, if that makes any sense. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
