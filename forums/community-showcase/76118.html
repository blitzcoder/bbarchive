Basically there is a long winding path across the map and you have to place weapons down at strategic points to try and kill the enemies that follow the path before they get to the end (where the 'Tower' is).<br><br>At the moment this game is still in a very early phase (I only started it yesterday), however it is playable and pretty fun. All the graphics are currently programmer art (made by me :() and the audio is from free sources around the internet. When its done I hope to have far more impressive graphics and a far more featureful game.<br><br>Anyhow I just wanted to ask what your thoughts are on the style of gameplay, if you like it or not.<br><br>You can get the prototype here; <br><a href="http://www.binaryphoenix.com/index.php?action=download&amp;id=89" target="_blank">http://www.binaryphoenix.com/index.php?action=download&amp;id=89</a><br><br>Basic instructions for gameplay;<br>Simple, at the start of each round you get 5 seconds to buy and place weapons. To place a weapon click its icon in the hud and place it where you want (it must be outside the path, unless its a mine). After the 5 seconds are up the enemies come and you have to hope your defences hold. When all enemies are dead or gone, the cycle restarts. Each round the enemies get harder, and the rewards for killing them greater.<br><br>Weapons can also be sold back at 75% of the original price and upgraded, you can do these by selected the weapon and pressing either of the buttons in the bottom-right of the HUD.<br><br>Screenshots;<br><img src="http://www.binaryphoenix.com/projects/Defence/Defence1.png"><br><img src="http://www.binaryphoenix.com/projects/Defence/Defence2.png"> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If place in a good place they can do quite a lot of damage. Theres also the consideration that it dosen't actually cost that much, as the further you get in the game the more money you get per enemy killed.<br><br>Anyhow I agree it is pretty unbalanced, its quite difficult getting the balance between cost, effectiveness and difficulty right.
