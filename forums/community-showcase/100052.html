Castlevania itself is not original in any sense of the word but a great series nonetheless. Nearly all of the ideas come from well established lore and fictional books. <br><br>For example you can make a Mario game but slightly change the look of the characters and there is nothing Nintendo or anyone can do about it. For example Jazz Jackrabbit is heavily inspired by Sonic (and Mario to a lessor extend) but it has many unique ideas all its own. Many of those sprites look like rough rips so I don't think anyone would be upset if he used those as place holders. Personally I would remove references to Castevania and instead make it a "Castevania inspired game" and possibly have a easter egg of Simon Belmont somewhere? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
