That project is complete, and a demo will be forthcoming shortly.  It's not up to me when the demo goes out, so you'll just have to wait to find out about that. :-)<br><br><br>This is my next project, which I am funding myself and developing with the assistance of an artist I've hired, tentatively titled "Ice Cream Mania".  <br><br>That name doesn't really fit the theme of the game however, so I plan to change it, and suggestions for alternatives would be appreciated.<br><br>This is a mockup of the main game screen:<br><img src="http://www.seamlesstexturegenerator.com/icm/shop-mockup.jpg"><br><br>The art for this is in a very early stage and much about it will change, but suggestions/critiques would be appreciated.<br><br>The people you see there are actually created like a paper doll.  All the face parts, hair, clothes, etc, are interchangeable, so that the customers will vary in appearance.  That's the only version set up as a sprite right now, so I just cloned him to see how multiple customers would appear.  <br><br>Cloning him revealed that the door and window are too small currently so those are going to be fixed to match the perspective.<br><br>These are the main characters:<br><img src="http://www.seamlesstexturegenerator.com/icm/malefemale.jpg"><br><br>This art is pretty close to final.<br><br><br>Here's some background on the game:<br><br><br>The two characters you see above are rivals.  I haven't decided yet if they will be brother and sister or not.  If so, then the player would not find out about that until the end of the game.<br><br>The game mixes ice cream with a western theme.  Hence the reason I need to change the name.<br><br>The two main characters will own shops at opposite ends of town, and there will be a saloon like building in the center of town which each has their eyes on for setting up shop in.  <br><br>That builidng will be labeled the O.J. Corral and it will be a "soda shop" that sells fruit drinks.  It will be up for sale, but neither ice cream shop owner will have enough money to buy it initially.  This is where the game begins.<br><br>After choosing which character you want to play, you will see a side view cinematic of the two shop owners staring eachother down from opposite sides of town, arms at their sides like a gunfighter, and then the game will switch to the in-shop behind-the-counter view you see above.<br><br>The gameplay will involve taking orders from the customers and filling them correctly as quickly as possible.  Thought bubbles will appear over the heads of multiple customers indicating which color ice cream they want, and in what order.  They may change their mind as well.<br><br>Once the customer has ordered, they will progress to the cash register.  And once you have finished the cone they ordered, you will click on them to hand them the cone, take their money, put the money in the register, and give them their change.<br><br>If you've made the order correctly, then this will go without a hitch, and if you've done it quickly, they'll be happy and will give you a tip.<br><br>If however you have gotten the order wrong, the customer may show his anger by refusing to pay, or giving you a lower tip or no tip.<br><br>The customers will also display their emotional state while standing in line, so if they start to get impatient you'll know you'd better speed things up.<br><br>As you progress in the game, improvements will be made to the shop.  At the end of each round/day some of the money you have made will go to fixing up damaged portions of your shop and resupplying.  And after a certain number of days/rounds, you will move into a bigger, better shop, which you will then proceed to improve just like the previous one.<br><br>Over time other changes will also occur.  While initially you might start out with only the three basic flavors of ice cream, over time you might gain as many as 12.  In addition you might gain the ability to produce such items as a bananna split, a sundae, or a float, or gain additional toppings.<br><br>I'm still working out the kinks in the gameplay though, and just writing this has helped me iron out a few gameplay elements I was unsure about.  One thing which is still troubling me is how I should go about handling the mouse and the player character.  On the one hand making the character slide side to side with the mouse would be cool, but on the other hand I can't have them blocking the items which the player needs to click on.  The character is also rather large to use transparency, (might kill the framerate) and they don't look as nice with transparency either.<br><br>Another big problem is the music.  I am having a hell of a time finding music to license which will fit the game.  I'm pretty sure I want some sort of country music to fit the western theme, but finding the right music has been a nightmare.  The low quality samples they provide on many sites, the lack of country songs on most of the freindlier to use licensing sites, and the need for music which is not annoying and can be enjoyed by people who don't generally listen to country music, are killing me.<br><br>If anyone has any suggestions for where I can find music that's right for this, or any gameplay suggestions or art related comments, it would be appreciated. :-)<br><br>Oh and if you're wondering about when the game will be out, I don't have a hell of a lot of time to finish it.  I've only got enough saved to get me through January, and I would REALLY like to have the game done by the end of November.  It just took me five months to complete another game I was working on, but I learned a lot about how I should set up the code for gameplay and menus while working on that, and created new libraries for handing fonts, images, and animation, and all that will help me get this coded quickly.  Also a lot of the delay on that project was simply waiting on the artists to get the work done, and I had no control over that on that project and they were really slow to get stuff done.  So I hope that this will be a realistic goal.<br><br>Well, let me know what you think, and throw any ideas you have my way! :-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It'll probably just end up sounding a bit corny, IMO.<br><br>Personally, I'd go for a short, snappy name that fits the (presumably) frantic gameplay, and the fact you're up against a rival. The name I came up with is "Scoops" - or maybe just "Scoop", or possibly "Scooper". I've highlighted the dictionary meanings of the word below, to show you why. :)<br><div class="quote"> <br>scoop // n. &amp; v.<br>n.<br>1 any of various objects resembling a spoon, esp.: a a short-handled deep shovel used for transferring grain, sugar, coal, coins, etc. b a large long-handled ladle used for transferring liquids. c the excavating part of a digging machine etc. d Med. a long-handled spoonlike instrument used for scraping parts of the body etc. e <b>an instrument used for serving portions of mashed potato, ice cream, etc.</b><br>2 a quantity taken up by a scoop.<br>3 a movement of or resembling scooping.<br>4 <b>a piece of news published by a newspaper etc. in advance of its rivals.</b><br>5 <b>a large profit made quickly or by anticipating one's competitors.</b><br>6 Mus. a singer's exaggerated portamento.<br>7 a scooped-out hollow etc.<br>v.tr.<br>1 (usu. foll. by out) hollow out with or as if with a scoop.<br>2 (usu. foll. by up) lift with or as if with a scoop.<br>3 <b>forestall (a rival newspaper, reporter, etc.) with a scoop.</b><br>4 <b>secure (a large profit etc.) esp. suddenly.</b><br> <br></div><br><br>The reason I've highlighted the one about being published in a newspaper is because I thought it would be a good idea to have a mock newspaper spin into view (like they do in the old movies) at the end of each level. The headline on the newspaper could give info about how you're doing against your competitor, etc. Kind of like they did in the "Paper Boy" game. Just an idea. :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I agree that it might not draw in the hardcore gamer crowd though.  It's most definitely not aimed at the very young.<br><br>I know the gameplay sounds simplistic on paper, but so does the gameplay of tetris.  "Player rotates falling peices of varying colors to fit them together."  Sounds boring, doesn't it?  Only way to know if it's fun is to actually code it.<br><br><br>Grey:<br>The shot is just a mockup in photoshop, so any antialiasing you see is merely a result of that.  While my BOB system can do antialiasing, you have to use it sparingly.  Using it for every character onscreen would probably cause too much of a speed hit and won't really improve the game's appearance that much except in screenshots.  I need to save that speed for making the main character transparent if neccessary. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I think all those industuments you listed are the right sort though.  I'm not sure what pedalsteel is though.  <br><br>And cliches?  Cliches are good.  <br><br>Though I did hear one song which tried to make a fake version of the famous whisling and harmonica theme you hear in a showdown (Doo dee doo dee doot!

I think for the scene where the characters face off I want something with a guatar... I think it's more of a spanish sound?

What would be more effective is sharpending the ends of chocolate flakes and putting them in the freezer so they are hard, and then driving them into the eye sockets of the zombies so that the brain is pierced (brain damage being the only effective way of killing a zombie).  If you got really good you could throw them from a distance, House of Flying Daggers, style.  Hope my info is useful.  I'm quite happy to be a zombie consultant on your project if you need more help. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Diner Dash was much more fun.  The problem I think is the game doesn't seem to force you to do anything other than refill the glasses when the customers want them refilled.  You can wash the glasses, but it's not necessary.  Also the display is really busy and the thought bubbles only appear for a moment and as a result it's hard to keep track of what the customers want.<br><br>Wild West Wendy on the other hand was pretty fun, once I figured out I could stack actions.  The gameplay really wasn't that different from Diner Dash or Betty's Beer Bar, yet Betty's Beer Bar somehow managed to not be much fun.  <br><br>I hope that the difference between being fun and not being fun isn't that the customers are spaced around the shop so you have to run around a lot.  That might not bode well for my game.  Of course, my game is a bit different from Beer Bar in that the customers will move about and you'll mever serve the same guy twice.  And the layout will be much clearer as to where the items are.  <br><br>This does get me thinking though about how I might want to include the ability to stack actions.  But then again, in my game you won't be able to serve more than one customer at once, or weild two objects at once.  And there is the focus on memorizing the orders.  So there are some major gameplay differences.  Stacking actions might not make sense in the context of my game's style.  Hm...  Well... maybe it would.  It could be helpful if you could click on more than one ice cream flavor without having to wait for the character to finish animating the scooping of it.  Hm.<br><br>I found anothe rgame while looking for those suggested above, called Pizza Frenzy.  While it doesn't play like the others, it was a lot of fun and had really nice graphics.  In that game, there were several play modes.  I played a simon says mode, where you have to fill orders as they come in.  You see a top down view of a city and you click on each person and the appropriate pizza factory to fill their order, and then a little pizza truck goes to their door and monye appears for you to click.  Then there are bonus games where you get scored based on how closely you can place toppings on a pizza to match an example pizza.  And as you advance you get to choose which toppings get added. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
