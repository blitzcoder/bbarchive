First off let me say that I can tell a lot of work has been put into this and it's quite a cool concept! One thing that I would definitely change is the speed of the character, it feels like you're running around in slow motion.  Secondly, I didn't really like the way combat was set up... It just doesn't seem right for the gameplay. Thirdly, I think the landscape needs a bit more variety, especially texture wise. If you made a few tweaks to this game, it would be even better than it already is :)<br><br>Planning on using your own media in later versions perhaps? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

For the combat, maybe you could explain your point a little more? And as for my own media, I'm currently checking with a couple artists to have original content.<br>Kaisuo <br> Thanks :)<br>jfk <br> Thanks again, like always ;)<br>Red Ocktober<br> Yeah, I have problems with lightning. I dunno how to make it look right. The ground is lightmapped though.. And the next update should contain a sky box, I wanted to make it for this version, but I was already 6 weeks into this patch, it had to come out ;) I know what ya mean, I'm on 56k too and I've got to upload this monster every now and then :P <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
