A strict verlet integration body is constructed out of particles and line constraints. The particles of one body are restricted from passing through the constraints of another body. This means that verlet bodies are constructed from lines and not circles. Verlet Max as it is taking shape here doesn't appear to be a strict verlet integration. <a href="/Account/showuser.php?id=11042" target="_blank">Nate the Great</a> seems to have taken a similar approach to the one I used in PhysLite by dispensing with constraint collisions and introducing circle-circle collisions instead. This technique, as far as I can tell, seems to be unique to the Blitz community and I believe was first devised by <a href="/Account/showuser.php?id=2921" target="_blank">Bouncer</a> in Blitz3D. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Pointmass to pointmass collisions has it's place and I used it effectively in my Stramash demo to simulate ragdolls / boxes etc...  For Polymaniacs, a box structure is the best fit for vehicles.  It's stable and easy to detect and fix inverted / broken constraints as a result of hard collisions.  Pointmass to pointmass collisions for body / body collisions are too inaccurate in this instance and can lead to interpenetration.
