I'm particularly interested in bugs and compatibility issues, but I'm interested in hearing just about anything from anyone who is prepared to give the demo a really good workout. I don't really want to start all over again later on in the development cycle, so I'm afraid I'm only interested in people who are prepared and able to commit time to testing future versions as well.<br><br>For the moment, it's just one level and a tutorial. The AI is extremely basic so that (in theory) no one should be able to die, and it's still a bit rough around the edges, but it seems pretty stable. Certainly the worst thing it could do is throw a runtime error and close the game.<br><br>It's pretty much Shader Model 2.0 only. Technically it should run without it, but I haven't tested the fixed function fallbacks and it's likely the game will be butt ugly without shaders anyway. As I say, for the moment, the option is there, but it's unlikely to make the final cut.<br><br>Please note that I'm not releasing any tools or documentation and I'm not offering any support for mods until the game is finished. However, that doesn't mean you can't start looking, learning and having a bit of a fiddle. If you are interested in making a turn-based tactics mod of any kind - I guess you could even do a total conversion if you really wanted - then getting in on the beta program might well give you a head start on everyone else.<br><br>Here's a couple of screenshots to give you a rough idea.<br><br>From the first level (in the beta demo)<br><br><img src="http://www.starsentineltactics.com/screens/screen2.jpg"><br><br>From a later level (not in the beta demo)<br><br><img src="http://www.starsentineltactics.com/screens/screen4.jpg"><br><br><br>If you'd like to sign up for the beta, please visit my website, and send me an email with all the requested information. You're not signing up for anything else, I just need you to send me an email so that I know who is testing and can keep track of all the feedback easily. I don't want to be scratching around various different forums looking for that reply that mentioned that feature I wanted to fix but now I can't remember when it broke.<br><br><a href="http://www.starsentineltactics.com/noflash/news4.html" target="_blank">http://www.starsentineltactics.com/noflash/news4.html</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Or maybe they don't want to bother for a one level demo? I'm currently evaluating a few options for how I can make this more attractive to testers.<br><br>One option would be to go with a "Mount And Blade" style open development beta, where people can "buy in" at any stage of development, and start playing immediately, but also get all updates until the game is finished, with some kind of early adopter discount as an additional reward. This would be a full 25+ level game beta. The upside for me is more testers, less timewasters (who wants to pay to slag someone off?) a bit of extra money to help finance development and testing of the entire game. The downside is a dramatic increase in pressure when people have already paid money, and it would be another couple months before I would be ready to do this.<br><br>The other option is to just make the 1 level plus tutorial beta public. The upside is that I get the most testers and I can do it right away, but the downside is that I probably also get a lot more timewasters, no money and probably a lot more pressure anyway.<br><br>So I'm leaning towards the first option but if anyone who saw this, considered testing and thought better of it would care to indicate why they thought better of it, what put them off, what would make them reconsider and which option they prefer, I'd love to hear from you. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
