Characters 'bounce' when walking against background scenery, which hinders dodging enemies,which is not necessarily a bad thing, but its not in the way that you might have intended.<br>2.When wizard/sorceress is selected, they are very hard to unselect, which may be due to sensitivity in the fire button buffer routine.<br>3.Not sure how the wizard/sorceress energy values work.No indication of how much magic energy you have left, and I could only bring back my dead creatures once in the game, despite having a monster on most of the power squares.Im pretty sure the c64 version showed the energy values and the dead characters could be brought back from the dead at much less energy cost.<br>4.Cant be 100% sure, but in the original versions,couldnt some characters like dragons and phoenixes for example, fly over the background scenery?<br>5.Wizards.sorceresses had 'steerable' fireballs in the original (as far as I can remember).<br><br>After all that, I just want to say, I absolutely love your remake, and the above comments are just minor nit picking and differences Ive noticed with the other versions. So glad that you are continuing the development of the game.<br>Cant wait for the next update... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I only changed to distributing the game like this (i.e. free, and free of any protection) to allow people to examine and play with the images. Sheesh... There's no pleasing some people!<br><br>Having said that, I don't use JPGs at all!? Also, the complete icon animations are stored in individual files, and not one frame per image. Only the weapons are stored in 1 file for each direction (not for each frame, as you imply). The existing font system was temporary (and ugly, as noted in the readme file), and was intended to be replaced with an Anti-Aliased font system (~75% coded). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
