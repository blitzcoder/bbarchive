You should be proud of that. To be honest though, I don't think that you can justify selling Light of Dreams for $10. I'm not quite sure what to write here because my full untactful opinion might seem rather brutal, and I don't want to discourage you from making games in the future.<br><br>As I said, it's an achievement to complete a game, and I'm sure that you will continue to improve your skills in the future. Don't be <i>too</i> disappointed if you fail to sell any copies of this particular game. Take it as a valuable learning experience and move on to your next project!<br><br>On a more specific note, I think you should think very carefully about the theme and title of your next game. Generally speaking, games with strong christian themes, titles, or biblican references are unappealing to the average gamer. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It took me a good few minutes to even find the download link on their page full of adverts - not good.<br><br>When the download eventually started it was downloading at a slap-in-the-face 13k/s on my 8mb connection.  I cancelled it.  I can't be bothered to wait 40 minutes for a demo to download.  That's 40 minutes of my life I'm never going to get back.<br><br>I don't like the look of your game.  So why was I downloading it?  Well, to give credibility to my argument that I don't like it.  I've seen more than enough screenshots of it and to be blunt, it just doesn't look very good.<br><br>Take the five screenshots above as an example.  All five are way too similar, and there is sod-all happening in any one of them.<br><br>I appreciate this might not be what you want to hear, but think about it logically - if people don't even want it for free, you'll be lucky if anybody outside your immediate family pays the asking price. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I think anyway the point about artwork is not whether someone likes it or not, but what makes a workman an artist is his special handwriting and the special interpretation of his theme. For that I would honor that game as a piece of artwork even if I wouldn't like its visual appearing. The swift, angelic moving of the character, the style a scene changed when you enter a building and the mystical atmosphere are other elements proving originality and spirit.<br><br>What makes me a little bit helpless is the gameplay itself. I don't know what to do in this world, I flew a little bit around and found in buildings some items obviously labeled with a price, but the people in this world would not talk to me and clicking at them seems just to raise some attack move. Here I think some in-game introducing (like a newcomer is welcomed near a well known chapel by a guardsman with an exclamation mark about his head leading him without problems into the new world) would have been nice. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

He would disappear off the bottom of the screen sometimes, and I'd have to rotate the camera, or change the camera zoom (C key I think) to fix the view.<br><br>Also, the movement is not quite right. The movement forwards and backwards, although very fast, is probably okay, but turning around is too fast, and it makes precise movement very difficult.<br><br>I think there is great potential here, and you must continue polishing it, but it's not *quite* there yet. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I appreciate the effort that goes into making games.<br><br>However, I remember you asking on a previous thread why no-one bought your games. Many people tried to explain why this was so in a tactful way, but you didn't listen. Have you noticed that very few people take the time to give you feedback any more?<br><br>Still, for what it's worth, here's some specific advice which I'm sure you will ignore:<br><br>1) Don't make Legends of Dreams. How many copies of Lights of Dreams have you sold? That's your customer base, and unless they all loved Lights of Dreams it is unlikely that they will all purchase Legends of Dreams. You need to ask yourself if enough people will purchase Legends of Dreams to make it viable. Remember, it only takes a single player to play a single player game, but an online community of players is necessary to sustain an online game.<br><br>2) Don't make Lights of Dreams 2. From what you've said about it, the plan seems to be to add more of what is already broken. The original Lights of Dreams has serious problems; before you even think about LoD2, I think that you should withdraw LoD from sale, fix the problems, rethink the game and, possibly, re-release it when it is in a better state to be sold. Or you could consider Lights of Dreams to be a valuable learning experience and apply what you've learned to an entirely new project.<br><br>3) Make less ambitious games in the future. Try making a smaller, more modest game. Pay more attention to developing tight and focused gameplay, and responsive controls, and work on your production values. God is in the details, right? <br><br>If you prefer to believe that I am jealous of you and your work then fine and good luck to you. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Should I be able to speak to the people in game?

What may be a good idea is to find a place where people have a less forceful view of gaming and gameplay, and let them see your game. I am sure their response will be more encouraging.<br><br>People who have never really played games before or with little experience may find your game a really great experience, but it's unlikely hard core gamers will, (they can be quite harsh with their opinions because they too make games or try to and know the processes).<br><br>The incredible thing is that you have managed to create something and finish it - I would think that most people on these forums who try to create a game fail, because that last 10-15% is very very difficult to endure.<br><br>- because of that I say "Well done!"  I think a couple of people above are being encouraging too and so they should - this is a community.  <br><br>On the sales front, if people don't want to buy it - then fine, notch it down to experience, try to learn from it and move onto the next project... and good luck with it.<br><br>Whatever you do dont waste your time arguing with people, take the best advice as 'wages' enough and move forwards.<br><br>IPete2. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I don't mean this to sound like an attack, but you posted 5 screenshots at the top of this thread and they all really look the same.<br><br>I think possibly that these games you are creating are the type of games that you really like and have put your heart and soul into, but at the same time they are quite specific and it seems as though you haven't really grasped how they look or play to other people.<br><br>If you are thinking there are significant differences between those five screenshots or that you're showing features that are `a big thing` to make them stand out, your sense of perspective is off and you've given too much credence to each of them. You have to step back and look at the bigger picture. At the moment your screenshots show some trees, some pillars and an altar thing. If this implies that these are the most exciting things in the game it really doesn't give a strong message as to how interesting the game is.<br><br>Each time that you've posted a new shot in the gallery pages, it strikes me every time as looking lifeless and unanimated. You have trees but you have what looks like absolutely no other vegetation - the ground looks much too bare. The characters look like they are stone statues as if you took a model from a 3d app and just inserted it into the landscape. It doesn't really give the impression that anything is really `happening`. It almost makes your game look like it's just a 3d model that you can browse around looking at, and gives very little clue as to any kind of atmosphere or gameplay or interactivity. I think people are picking up on that and hopefully it's not just me.<br><br>There is just something strangely lifeless about it at the moment, regardless of whether you've added particle effects. I'm sure you're proud of it and it's a great achievement for you but it isn't coming across to other people that it's something that they would also be excited about.<br><br>Maybe posting a new movie would help so we can see some things happening and moving about. At the moment it just looks like there is nothing going on and therefore there is very little way for the viewer to get `into` what they're looking at. They can't say `hey I want to be a part of THAT!` because there's so little if anything in the images that shows that there's anything to be part OF.<br><br>Graphically you also have no shadows, from what I can tell, and at night there should be a lot of shadows. I think your style has a sort of `dreamy` or dream-like quality but at the same time it doesn't feel like something you can interact with.<br><br>Your display is also a little bare seeming. You have no HUD, there is no symbolism to represent that you have a certain energy level or have picked up certain objects or that you've interacted with the world in any way. Icons/symbols represent your successes and failures and what you've learned on your travels. Maybe you intended that but it detracts from making it seem like a game. It almost looks more like a screensaver or a very passive `technical demo` that someone would just watch and not interact with.<br><br><br>Most of your shots are showing landscapes but almost no life forms but for one or two lifeless-looking statuesque characters. They stand with no animation to them whatsoever, looking as stiff as a board. You have to convey that they are alive otherwise you aren't suceeding in your animation and storytelling. At this point is doesn't look fun to play and it's hard to even figure out what kind of a game it is or what you actually do. You need to give the player and us criticizers some more obvious clues. If it is not meant to be an action game then you need to make that much clearer.<br><br>I'm glad you've taken all the time you have to put this together and I'm sure you are pleased with it and have high hopes for it, and I'm no hardcore gamer, but at the moment I wouldn't even consider buying this the way it is. Some other people probably would differ and think it is great. I just don't think it has `mass appeal` at this point. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Animations look like the one weak point!<br>My suggestion (though I have definitely not tried this myself), is to come up with a system so you can easily add subtle animations that occur on various conditions, then give yourself a good bit of time just adding movement to liven this up. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Now that you mention it, that's exactly what it is.<br><br>Your customers aren't here on the blitz forums.  We're all developers.  It's hard to sell indie games to indie developers in general.  Your audience is...well I don't know where it is to be honest.  Atm, based on the screenshots and the reviews I've seen, the audience doesn't exist atm.<br><br>Sorry to jump your azz but I think you're acting like an idiot and jumping down everyone's throat out of frustration.  The game isn't good man.  Keep working on it and eventually it may be good.  I assure you that NO ONE here is jealous of your game.  I am 100% sure of that.<br><br>Final advice:  redo the character models and animations.  If you're the one that did them then get someone else to do them cuz they're not good.  Fix the timing issue.  Put some color in the game.  Just do...something to it....anything...You did all these different pieces but instead of really making them good, you just went "well that looks ok"...and moved on to the next part.  It's all rushed...and it looks that way too.<br><br>But...stop bitching for people to buy your game so you can buy software.  It sounds like you're looking for a handout.  If your game was as great as you claim, you wouldn't be begging for people to buy it... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There's a womean in front of me who says I should be prepared to speak to the chief, but when I go into the building she's guarding, it's a shop, and no sign of the chief. Most of the other people I can't talk to ( I'm assuming M is the talk key ) and then there's just a huge world to run or fly around but nothing really to do.<br><br>Instead of adding another fifteen levels every time someone criticizes the game, why not fix the problem they had?

I love rpg style games so i always look forward to them.<br><br>ps Just gonna say this though, i have seen some great blitz3d projects, yet unreleased, that are AAA - great mechanics, graphics, polish etc and this really doesn't even come close.<br>You just keeping learning, improving and listening, hopefully one day, with the effort you've shown, you too can bring a great quality game. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
