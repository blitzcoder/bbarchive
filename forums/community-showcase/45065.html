Maybe one reason is for teaming up, but if anyone is really interested he'll talk to a number of people, most have web pages or emails so most might not see the real use of having such 'personal' info in a community. And its enough work to keep one or two worklogs. A new forum is really really not needed tho.<br><br>The only good new community feature that i can think of is to create some sort of a ranking table listing what each member did, and letting others grade these creations and download them. That way the best of the best ever made in Blitz will be easily found and people will get credit. There might be an attempt of such a thing at bc.com showcase but its utterly cluttered up with ten tons of mostly useless stuff. It would be good if someone could maintain such a list and administer it! That is what i want Xip to make. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I have seen a lot of people on the net who claim dyslexia but I suspect laziness, etc. - not so with you, though.<br><br>So, how does this affect your programming? How do you manage? Also, if syntax checking in a compiler can help correct mistakes, why not use spelling checker for your posts to make them more readable?<br><br>Just curious.
