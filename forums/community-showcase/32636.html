Everything else in the game is smooth and pretty; as reported, it's only just before the ball hits the pins and as the pins recover from that hit that the frame rate falls through the floor.<br><br>On a somewhat unrelated note, can I suggest you pare down your control system a lil?  For someone who wants to just get from one frame to the next with a minimum of fuss, there's just too many mouse clicks required.  <br><br>Might I suggest the following for your consideration:<br><br> - Remove the need to 'aim and shoot'.  Have the pins displayed all the time in (perhaps) a lil window up in the corner - nobody wants to have to click to see what's remaining, it should just be there.  If you remove the opportunity/need to click on the pins to see them, then that means you can just go straight into the 'aim and shoot' phase... which of course is just what people wanna do.<br><br> - Once you get past that bit, you have click to: aim the line down the alley; choose the angle down the alley; choose the strength of the shot; and then choose the spin of the ball.  I appreciate that allows for a lot of control, but (again) if people are there to bowl, they just wanna get bowling - after all, that's the fun part.  I can't help feeling there's a better way overall to get most of that functionality into your controls, but at the very least I would suggest you get rid of the 'choose angle' segment - that aspect of the bowl is covered by the spin you add (as far as an arcade bowling game is concerned, anyway).  Again, I'm sure there's a better way to implement your control method and as far as your core gameplay goes (ie not counting tournaments or multiplayer or whatever - just the bowling itself) it's the weak link in the experience (imho, of course).<br><br>(Of course, this relates mainly to the control method in Practice, as opposed to Practice Two, but Practice Two is only marginally better as far as accessibility)<br><br>Apart from that, I find the game excellently presented and produced.  Really top notch.  See if you can make it a bit more heedlessly fun, and you'll be on a winner.<br><br>PS:  Having played it a bit more now (surely that's got to be some sort of encouragement?) it's probably not a good thing that I ended up with one hand on the mouse and the other resting on the ESC key so I could skip through the cut-scenes and *get on with it*.  An option to display them once at the start and then have them turned off, perhaps?  I choose to speak for all humankind when I say that the only part of a bowling game that anyone truly cares about is the bit where the ball rolls down the alley and hits the pins.  Everything else just needs to be tolerated until that alley bit can happen again.<br><br>PPS:  And given how much we need to see them (usually sitting there impudently observing the pitiful efforts of the bowling ball to knock them down), and the high quality of everything else, you really should put a lot more work into making the (close up view of the) pins look exceptionally excellent (or, at least, a lil better than they are.  Clearly you - or your graphic artist - are capable). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's probably not the control method I would choose, and I can see why people don't like it. The reason it's there and the reason it's so staccato is because I want it to be accessible to the typical indie gamers who don't play a lot of games and certainly don't play games requiring hand-eye coordination. Control method #2 is the control method for experienced gamers who do have good hand-eye coordination, though I quite accept that method 2 is not right yet.<br><br>When you say get rid of the "choose angle segment", do you mean I should just assume it's in a straight line down the alley from where they line up? That's certainly doable, but it does mean that certain shots are impossible and you won't always be able to make up for it with spin. ( Usually, but not always. )<br><br>I'll have another look at the controls. Maybe I need three control options. The current Staccato controls, a simpler arcade controls set and the TruBowl controls ( Practice 2 ) which gives you direct control over the shot.<br><br>Is three different control sets too much? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Perhaps the issue I have is less with the amount of clicking that needs doing as much as the amount of clicking that needs doing *before anything happens*.  I'm sure I'm sailing perilously close to the "needs a major rewrite" wind, but perhaps if she could start bowling once you set up the 'aiming', and you set the strength and spin whilst she's moving, perhaps that would make things 'flow' a bit better.  I'm loathe to compare games to others (the Virtual Tennis/ATB debate is still ringing in my ears), but I keep thinking how other bowling games have managed it, and I keep coming back to 10th Frame on the C64, which had a golf-game-like 3-click system.  Now, I'm in no way suggesting that specifically, but in that, you set where your bowler stood and the angle he bowled at, and then strength of shot and the amount of spin were set using the 3-click system whilst the bowler animated his way up to the line. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
