That fruity also had some cool features - winner spinners, various levels of gambling where you had to hit the key just at the right spot in a looping sound effect, etc. Lots of fun. This one looks pretty good ... One thing I don't quite get is why the perspective on the reels is so extreme. I would think that if you are fairly close to a fruitmachine the reels wouldn't look anywhere near so warped and all of them would look almos the same shape. Is this to do with the depth of your perspective or the size of your reels or something? I also wonder if it's to do with perhaps real fruitmachiens have much larger reels with lots more items on each reel? I probably had at least 20 or more items on each reel, looks like you might only have 10-12 on yours?<br>I think you could do with some more features. I know real fruitmachines have all sorts of wierd lighst and such, is there no nudge pot or some kind of jackpot-pot or nudge buttons, hold buttons? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I am figuring how to implement them as I code the INI file (which will also hold the last JACKPOT amount and reset the jackpot amount if you add more money to your "account".)<br><br>The hard part about doing skins is the popup ODDS window... I populated the wheel with a LONG strip graphic... changing that would be no problem but I have a static graphic for the ODDS window painted on a sprite... The odds window would have to be completely redone using some sort of Rectangle command and then clipping the images from the wheel (which would not be too hard to do I suppose since the ......

...
OddsSprite = LoadTexture(Root$ + "\" + Skin$ + "\" + "OddsChart.bmp")

But when you go to the "menu" (sic) screen, there is no button, but says "press esc to quit" . My point is, it should be a "quit" button, not a keyboard command, to keep design consistency. If you catch my drift :)<br><br>other small quibbles:<br><br>the "bet" buttons and the "bet amount" indicator are too far apart. the buttons are kind of bottom left, and the "bet amount" is top right, it took me ages to figure out that something was happening when I clicked the buttons, because the "bet amount" ticks over on a totally different area of the screen.<br><br>the big round buttons, that is, the main play buttons, light up with some effect when mouseover.

I found that if I added new machines that the user could overload his/her video card really easily. I wasn't cleaning up.<br><br>And it is difficult to clean up. I suppose BMax makes this easier but I am using B3D and I have had to track down memory hemmorages that shouldn't happen. <br><br>Yes.. I know about clearworld() and I know anout freeimage and freeentity etc. I have just had to apply them <i>in the right locations</i> so the program will work and not put things where they don't belong.<br><br>As it is the program uses about 9 megs of video card memory now and that seems to remain constant... so I have confidence it will work on <i>most</i> average level PCs out there in Cyberland (which seems to be located very near Lalaland at times.)<br><br>I have decided to use a seperate program to control software registration. It is easier and does not create a hackable .exe as easily.<br><br>Now to PAK it and see what sort of mess I can make. Perhaps I should use molebox? We will see. <br><br>Rollout is hopefully slated for three weeks from now (OK I <i>said</i> hopefully!)

She cannot pull out the textures for anything BUT Texas Wildcard (In the new version of the game) I think... Nah... I wonder if the performance numbers by geForce are real... If they take shortcuts somewhere... The game only occupies 9mb Graphics Card Memory as it is now (three skins and textures all packed up) and you are not the first geForce user to report an error, you are the only one to report blank wheels... I had another that had no buttons just pink boxes... and one that showed the gears as wireframe for some reason (but he could not generate a screenshot)<br><br>I am at a loss... I recoded the original (the one you have) to open and write to a debuglog.txt file... everything is loaded... according to the file... Maybe geForce deletes them too quickly from the computer before the whell model is loaded...???... Let em recode that and run it on Li Mei's computer...<br><br>RZ <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
