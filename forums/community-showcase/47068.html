( if it runs badly in 1600x1200x32 with shadows and crowds on, at least turn it down to 640x480x0 with shadows and crowds off and tell me if it's ok like that. ) It's currently unoptimized, so it could be slow. There's no onscreen FPS counter, and no game-timing so just tell me if it's smooth enough to play.<br><br><br><br><img src="http://www.animebowlingbabes.com/atb2.jpg"><br><br><a href="http://www.animebowlingbabes.com/atb2_alpha.exe" target="_blank">Download (5MB)</a><br><br>**************************<br>PLEASE READ BEFORE PLAYING<br>**************************<br><br>.. And definitely read before complaining ;o)<br><br>This is just about the controls and performance. I probably know about all the other missing features, little bugs, unexpected behaviour. It's stable though, you can alt-tab out of it if it should lock up ( never has in days of testing here ) and won't do anything nasty.<br><br>Most menu options are not implemented. The only options you need concern yourself with are Options\Graphics Options and New Game\Special\Practice<br><br>Clicking options which have not been implemented can cause the menu to ignore legitimate commands, so you've been warned.<br><br>Controls are mouse only. Move the mouse to move the player. Hitting the ball is semi-automatic. If you're in a viable position, the player will attempt to play a shot ( or dive  if the ball is a little out of reach ) but the shot will just be a standard return to the middle of the court.<br><br>The full range of shots ( at least so far ) are as follows :<br><br>Left Click - Standard shot to left of screen. ( Not left of player )<br><br>Right Click - Standard shot to right of screen. ( not right of player )<br><br>Double Left Click - Lob to left of screen.<br><br>Double Right Click - Lob to right of screen.<br><br>Hold Left Click - Drop shot to left of screen.<br><br>Hold Right Click - Drop shot to right of screen.<br><br><br>At the moment, the shots are pretty focussed, but that's not a fault as there's much more to be added. There will be much more variety in the final game, this is just a quick test to see if the controls feel reasonably intuitive.<br><br>Yes, there is no game timing yet. It's locked to refresh rate so  you may need turn it on in drivers if you've disabled it.<br><br>Yes, there are a lot of things missing, and a number of things don't work as they should, but I can't add anything more without cementing in the controls, so I need to know if  the controls need changing sooner rather than later.<br><br>Thanks for testing.<br><br>Oh, and assuming I can ever find the time to get it finished, yes, it will be free to everyone who bought the original. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I like it so far.  Have to see what it's like in a match.  The only niggle is that I wish the player character was a little further up from the bottom of the screen and that the mouse was hidden as it kinda messed me up sometimes.  Great improvement over the last one though you'll probably do really well with this. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Then i figured clicking helped. There are two small problems that i found. By moving the mouse, i cant really say for sure where she will move or in other words how much my mouse movement will exaclty move the girl. I can see the cursor and thats extra confusing, so i guess youll remove the cursor in the final game and i suggest that you add some kind of indication on the court where the girl will be moving when you move the mouse. Secondly, i wasnt sure if i'm in position to hit the ball, somehow i wasnt sure the ball was near me when it passed. I wasnt too focused when i tried it, but maybe you can make the "3D feeling" more 3D somehow, of where the ball is. The animation changes are pretty sudden, and perhaps that doesnt exactly help to imagine where i'll be hitting the ball. But in general, theyre ok. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'd prefer the controls to be short click for drop shot, long click for long shot, although you could easily make this optional.<br><br>5.
