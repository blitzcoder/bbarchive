Some say it's a dino, some call it zombie, however. What's really new is the license, so now you can build a game with it and decide later if you want to buy a license or not.<br><br>BTW. registered Users will get a full update in the next days.<br><br>The binary was compiled with Blitz3D 1.04 (because with 1.06 there was a problem with sprites that are parented to the camera).<br><br>If you had any crashes or if you want to make a comment, this would be the place to tell me about it, thanks for your attention.<br><br>Edit: BTW: since the game is a 130 MB download (and there may be problems on some systems) you may want to download the Construction Kit first (23MB) and see if the engine works on your machine (both, if it works or not, some information about the environment would be useful for me).<br><br>Download Section of the official project site:<br><a href="http://www.melog.ch/dropper/downloads.html" target="_blank">http://www.melog.ch/dropper/downloads.html</a><br><br>EDIT<br>To complete this, let me add some extra information here. Please note: Stop reading here if you don't want to know how the story ends, but prefere to unfold the plot by your own. <br><br><b>Story</b><br>John Smith, an average Loser realizes that somebody is trying to destroy him, but he doesn't know who it is. He will then escape from his city. During the escape, he has to kill several armed agents. A mysterious "helping hood society" will then contact him and hire him for an "easy mission". In exchange they promise to tell him who his persecutors are. The "easy mission" then turns into a blood bath, and Smith realizes that he was fooled. He gets kidnapped and wakes up in a locked room where he will have to break out. It turns out he is in the castle of the boss of the organisation that wants to eliminate him. Here, you may guess it already, he has to kill all guards, find the boss, kill him too, destroy the castle and escape alive.<br><br>Complete solution...<br><b>Level 1: Dirty ol Town</b><br>Walk around and talk to the civilian people. Don't go to the restricted area. You'll find out that Joe is selling guns. Go to Joes Bar and start talking to him. If he's not there, you may wait for him in the bar, or search for him around the house. He's going to tell you that you need some money to buy a gun.<br>A lady in a orange dress is telling you that she's hiding her money at a save place. Try to follow her, but not in the restricted area. You'll find some money somewhere, but take care not to get shot by a guard at that place. Go back to Joe's bar, Joe will now tell you the combination for his Save that can be found in the backroom of his bar. (Note you need to RMB-cick the code followed by "A", in some cases you first have to clear the Codelock input buffer by clicking the "C" Button). Take the gun and the ammunition out of the Save, go to the restricted area and shot down the guards, one by one and carefully from a rather save position, behind a corner or so. Use Headshots, otherwise this may be too hard. Save your ammunition, there is no additional Ammo in this level. (Unless you're useing a cheat). When you have shot them all, you can savely explore this part of the city. On a paper you can read that the Subwaystation is closed and the key must be on the floor somewhere around here. Find and pick up the key, then go to the Train Station (blue sign over the door) that is now open. Go to the 2nd, inner door. Mission Complete.<br><br><b>Level 2: The Facility</b><br>There isn't much to achieve in this level, but it may be not so easy to stay alive because of many enemies and some places where they will shoot from all sides.<br>After the start, turn back and find the SIG P220, pick it up, as well as the Ammo on the left side. You may also read the Notice on the container there. Then go to the containers on the right side near the tower and pick up the sniper rifle. It does contain only 3 rounds of ammo, but they may be useful to "take out" some of the guards from a distant point (tho, from a cold barrel you may miss the first shot). With the SIG only you'll run out of ammo soon, but there is a Glock right on the crate at the side of the yellow truck (the one without radioactive barrels on it). There is also an Ingram MAC11 at the other side of the place, near the wooden fence, it's up to you to decide which gun you want to take first. Carefully go forward and kill any enemy you see. Before you cross any place, wait behind a corner and shoot the bad guys. Take care not to get too close to those radioactive barrels, they can be heared with your embedded geigercounter if you are too close. Also make sure not to get in contact with those doberman dogs, but shooting them may be a waste of ammo. At several places there are crates full of explosives. When you are not too close to them and when an enemy (or more than one) is standing close to such a crate, shoot it, it will explode and kill all nearby standing NPCs. There are several guns in the level that you may need to find and pickup to be able to kill all enemies. Just explore the site, but be careful and go forward slowly. After you have cleared the facility from any enemy activity, you'll find a grey container on a railway waggon. You need to jump into the open container, using the crates on the floor as a stairway. This may be a bit tricky (certain gravity issues have been seen due to a low framerate, but it should be ok with rates of 30 and higher). Contrary to the mission briefing, that promised a suitcase in a grey container, you will find only a red button here. Press it - you realize this was a trap! You're locked in the container. Mission complete.<br><br><b>Level3: Your Castle will fall</b><br>You  wake up in a room, you don't know where you are. The door is locked. There is a Voice recorder, click the play button, again the mysterious Boss of the evil "Blobs" will tell you that you are doomed to die etc. Explore the room. At some point when you crouch you'll see there is a key sticking at the bottom of a table. Take it and open the door. You find yourself in a castle. If there is no enemy right in front of you (otherwise go back and wait a few seconds) then run straight forward until you reach the stairways down to the castle yard. Don't stop here, just cross the place and run right into the little Pub on the other side. In the pub you must wait until the employees will no longer be in panic and will stop running around (don't pick up the guns yet, or if you did, hit "H" t hide the gun, otherwise the NPCs will remain in panic). Talk to the NPCs to find out who's the owner of the castle, where he is and how to get to him. Also make use of the medipacks you can find here. Once one of the employees has revealed that the security code lock to the east part of the building can be opened with a certain code, pick up the guns and the ammo in the kitchen, then go out to the castle place. Shoot the 2 guards here. There is no need to shoot the guards on the castle walls, but you can try that if you want. Go to the Gate that seperates the east part from the west part. Open it with the code given to you and be prepared to shoot two soldiers right after the gate has opened. Go to the door at the left side and enter the house. Take all items from the room at the right side, then enter the first room at the left side. Shoot the guard inside this room, take the money and the key. also read the notice on the wall about explosives. Go back, out of the building. Go to the other door and enter, you'll see there is a wall that needs to be removed with explosives. So go back to the west part of the castle, to the main castle front gate that you now can open. Shoot the guard at the front gate and take care not to get too close to the dogs. Go to the left side and pick up the Box with C4 Explosives. Then go back to the east part, to the wall you want to remove. Drop a C4 bomb near the wall, then make sure you're not standing too close. It will explode 10 seconds later. It may have killed the Soldier that is patroling behind the wall, otherwise you shoot him. First go to the room at the end of the corridor, inside you'll find a minigun, pick it up. Also make sure to pick up all medipacks to get a 100% health state. Then go to the first lefthand door and enter. Be prepared to get attacked. You'll have to shoot the evil boss here and try to "fixate" him with bullets as much as you can. During bullet impacts on his body he is paralyzed to some degree, so you should try to use this weakness, otherwise it may be too hard to kill him, since his supernatural powers will make him rather unvincible for single bullets. After his death, you'll find a handy nuclear bomb on his table. Activate it. Mission goal is now accomplished. Go to the black helicopter and activate it.

I spent some money in 3D content and Sound Licenses, it would have been a complete waste if I did not release it. Most of the Level design is made by Steve from Arteria3D. I like it very much, but from a tech point of view the meshes are a little bit uneconomical (eg. clone tris), so the game may be rather slow for such simple Graphics.<br><br>There are no stencil shadows in the game, I do however utilize the Lightmaps to shade the NPCs according to their location.<br><br>Gabriel, did I mention that I had to remove that chateau demo due to a legal issue between me and <i>edit: somebody whos name I maybe should not mention here</i>? I wonder why they did not sue Deus Ex 1, because it contained they same "illegal mention" of the name.<br><br>I would not say the game looks awesome. Other engines are looking much better. But unlike other engines, it is really a game engine, not only a 3D engine with some gameplay possibilities. In the first demo, the chateau demo I tried to get a story and everything that makes an entertaining game. With this version I came back to the old philosophy and I tried to use story elements that are makeing a good game, let me mention esp. one of them: the unexpected turn in the storyline.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2010</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

When I don't move it (eg. by walking straight in one direction) then the framerate is dropping rapidly.<br><br>This only happens in windowed mode.

After that last line "successfully loaded options settings" the scene will be cached.<br><br>You maybe know when you're loading a lot of meshes and then run the game loop, the machine will run jerky with pauses and breaks for the first 10 Seconds or so. This is why I added this Scene caching.<br>A camera will be created and positioned 10000 units from the center away. It has a range of 0.01 to 20000. It will then perform a couple of renders, to ensure everything will be rendered smoothly from now on.<br><br>I am surprised, that this function causes problems, because it may be slow and almost freeze the app for several seconds, but basicly it always used to work even on rather weak machines.<br><br>So it wasn't everything fine. If so, there would have been a last line with something like "Will now start Main Loop".  I wonder if a camera range of 0.01 to 20000 could be a problem for some systems.<br><br>I also got some repeated Renderwords there, like:<br>Renderworld()<br>Renderworld()<br>Renderworld()<br><br>Maybe a source for problems with Multi Core Processors?<br><br>BTW Bladerunner - I guess you meant GF 7900GT, right?<br><br>EDIT: here's a little test program that is doing about the same as the caching function:<br><br><pre class=code>

I really have no clue what's wrong. The code doesn't do anything special. Just plain Blitz3D, esp. during standard game mode, like walking around. If it would crash as soon  as a dialogue is started, then I'd say it something with the texture crossfader, but as you say, 0.3 fps from beginning on, and the second time even with no graphics... Maybe, when you have got the patience, you could try it in a FUllscreen Mode. Probably the 0.3 fps has something to do with process priority. At least that's what I get on XP - windowed mode is jerky und rather unplayable due to some strange dynamic process priority management.<br><br>Well, there is always a small percentage of machines that won't play it properly, it has always been like that. What matters is the number of them. Unfort. it seems this number is increasing more and more.<br><br>But as far as I know there are known issues with DX10. Did you have other issues with Blitz3D, eg. with Sprites? It seems to be a problem in general that DX10 is only emulating DX7 and it doesn't do that correctly. Maybe they will fix some issues in the near future.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2010</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Meanwhile I used to write a Sprites Substitute function set that overrides all Sprites Functions and is using Quad Meshes instead (see code archives), I probably will implement it in the engine  as a generic compatibility approach the sooner or later.<br><br>It isn't the lack of modern features in Blitz3D that makes me searching for an other tool, it's Compatibility problems like these. Then again, I'd be surprised if Blitz3D hasn't still one of the best compatibilites right out of the box. It's just, when your sourcecode it getting 12 thousand lines long or longer, many things can happen. Maybe I want too much.

Thank you for this error report. Are we talking about the game(130MB) or the contruction kit (23MB)? Is it 100% reproducable?<br><br>What I can tell you is this: After your last log line the following Commands should be executed:<br><br>Wbuffer 1<br>LoadFont<br>FreeFont<br>Setfont<br>GraphicsWidth()<br>Stringheight<br>If, Then<br>Global<br><br>no user functions, no arrays, no types, just a few simple variables.<br><br>After that the next log line should follow. I definitely haven't got a clue what could be wrong with these Blitz Commands, you may try them in Blitz3D on your machine. I am using a fontsize that is calculated from the screensize, maybe the resulting float could be the cause? eg. font=loadfont("Arial",GraphicsWidth()/49.0). Tho, I don't think so. Probably WBuffer?<br><br>BTW how do you mean "screen shows a negative VRAM value (-1899016192)" ? Do you mean the engines warning at startup "warning ,low videoram: _free_vram_" ? If so, then this should not be a problem, because it's only a warning. But I'd really wonder why it says that, because all it does is: <br>if TotalVidMem()&lt;127000000 then <br>print "warning, low video ram: "+TotalVidMem()<br>endif<br><br>(But I instantly realize that we are getting closer to average Vram sizes greater than 2 and 4 Gigabytes, something that will cause problems in many situations, not only with Blitz...)<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2010</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It came with the replacement of the sprites by meshbased quads, as explained earlier. This transformation was so quick,  maybe too quick. However, if you look 90 degrees down to your feet or up in the sky (that's the max anyway), the HUD will go crazy, I mean, really crazy. I thought it's a collision thing, but now it seems it's a rounding error or similar math thing in the internal matrix for parented objects - at least I guess so. I don't want to blame it on blitz easily. It's just, it seems to be like that.<br><br>I however reduced the limit for the camera pitch angle to -88 to 88 (instead of 90) and now it is fixed. All releases have been <b>updated</b>, only the game still has to be uploaded<br><br>It's not a big deal and you may play trough the game without to notice the bug at all, but if you coincedently look straigt down to the ground, the HUD will play crazy. I'll let you know when a new download link for the game is ready. Meanwhile make sure to get the latest version of the construction kit.<br><br><b>EDIT: ok, the latest version of the game is online</b>, make sure to refresh the download page at  <a href="http://www.melog.ch/dropper/downloads.html" target="_blank">http://www.melog.ch/dropper/downloads.html</a> to get the most recent download link.<br><br>Again thanks everbody for testing, esp. Krishan (tho your negative amount of Vram seems a bit exotic :°) but maybe that's just the way DX 7 Support works today.

The negative Vram Amount is really a Bug, I hope it does not cause much further problems. One thing is: if the engine is "thinking" the user is running out of Vram (eg. less then 16 megs free), then it will not cache things like scaled background Images (Menu etc.),so each time you hit ESC for the Main Menu, it will take a few seconds to rescale the image, trying not to waste Vram. I will have to work around this bug the sooner or later, esp. if AvailVidMem() is also broken.<br> Could you please make a little test for me:<br>print TotalVidMem():Print AvailVidMem():waitkey(); both negative?<br><br>But for now, unfortunately I have just discovered <b>a further bug</b> that caused a MAV(!) when toggling the "ghost" cheat off (maybe also in other situations, so I better fix this right now). It was caused by some attempts to fix an other bug, mentioned just in my previous post (crazy HUD bug). At least it was easy to fix. I <b>uploaded yet another version</b> this time hopefully stabile.
