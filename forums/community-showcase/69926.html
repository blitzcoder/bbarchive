How many of them? Does this happen on other machines too? Probably a dds path pachter problem. You know the problem is meshes often have a full path stored, so they will find the original texture on the developers machine (assume the original is located in an other folder than the game), but can't find it on a users machine since the texture is missing in the game folder (Blitz is trying to load it from the mesh's folder if the full path doesn't work).  Next timeI really should test it on an other machine first. Thanks for testing.<br><br>Snader, so what is it, several minutes, or how many seconds exactly? As I said, on my 1.6 GHz cpu it takes 5 seconds. This is by the way the time the engine requires to initialize. I know some commercial game engines that are taking in fact "several minutes" to load, but mine definitely doesn't.<br><br>Consider I was working 4 years on it, hundreds, probably thousands of hours.

[EDIT: Just had another play and it switches you into that view if the other gun(s) run out of bullets too.]<br><br>-I also had the odd pauses after pressing space at the start -- a couple of seconds at most, but it's kinda confusing and unprofessional.<br><br>-I could saunter though one of the sets of fencing with the lions-head motif (round the back, near chopper) -- just a map issue, really. Also noticed that missing floor texture.<br><br>-'Congratulaton<u>s</u>'<br><br>-It's tough to comment on the gameplay because I'm on an Intel chipset too and the framerate exaggerates any problems. It's fairly clear, though, that enemies (well, the human ones at least) need to react to being shot and the AI really isn't a lot of fun to combat. The soldiers just seem to skitter around before stopping at brief random intervals to pop off a shot, the end result being that you get bored of tracking their movement (and here's where the framerate raises its head, because <i>gawd</i> it's next to impossible to shoot the buggers while they're moving horizontally across the screen on my machine). The heavier weapons alleviate the problem but it shouldn't really exist at all -- I bet the guy guarding the sniper rifle running several 'lengths' of the shed at full tilt before defending himself looks kinda farcical even on the beefiest rig.<br><br>I hope that's not too negative -- I'm always impressed with the scope of what you achieve with CSP and enjoy checking out each new demo. I would quite like to see a demo constructed from a set of smaller, interlinked sections at some point, mind, just so the required specs are lower; And is it only me who finds it odd that you don't demo the actual tool(s)? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Other than that, I cannot skip the engine initialisation :) And BTW I AM unprofessional, like most people here, so this is no surprise.<br><br>The sniper thing - I can't confress what you say. If you pick it up, it won't be autoselected, like other guns. You have to explicitely hit "7" or if you got more than only the sniper gun, you can press the middle mousebutton to cycle trough all guns. <br><br>If you however want to get rid of the sniper scope view, you can always hit "h" to hide the current gun. Thought this is obvious since listed in the main help.<br><br>Yes, if you run out of ammo and the next gun is the sniper, it will switch to this mode. I was assuming the player want to continue shooting no matter what. If you want to skip this gun, click the MMB to select the next one. <br><br>While this scope mode probably is not very fps-conventional, just like many other things in the project, I'd also mention that "fps-convention" is a very subjective term. For some people it means counterstrike etc. like. Other people would rather reference NOLF, Hitman or splinter Cell, they are very "unconventional" as well.<br><br>I agree, the "AI" is really very simple, almost inexistent. This is especially obvious if you play with the god cheat or so, and track their movement repeatedly. If you are in non-god mode, and if the framerate is high enough then it may be a little diffrent. The ants scene is a good example: although simple attack routines are used (as you described), there will be 3 ants who are simultanously attacking you from all sides and you need to keep your focus on all the energy clouds they shoot at you. But i repeat, the AI surely is something that needs work. Due the current debatte to completely forbid socalled "Killer Games" in germany (they're crazy, of course), I am thinking about to add alternative features instead, like a dialog system with some kind of AI. So it could be used for non-shooter games.<br><br>It still sounds to me as if you compare this to commercial engines. Not sure if this is a good thing, maybe yes.<br><br>Noless I would still like to compare this to other playable "fps" engine demos or games written in Blitz3D and if it's in the top ten then it's ok for me, since there are more than 10 thousand Blitz3D users AFAIK.<br><br>I hope I'll be able to make a new map soon, one that renders faster. I have plans for releasing the tools, but I first need to add some features, eg. a good trial expiration. Probably I'll even release them unlimited. Depends on a new license model.<br><br>To &gt;&lt;)))º&gt;<br><br>Thanks. I also wish there was a better sniper rifle. Although, I like a simple remington 700 with a simple scope, and no hitech (other than maybe a seperate range finder), I would like to add wind and whether to affect the bullet, as well as to use real bullet speed and parabellum curves etc.<br><br>But this would be more a real sniper sim, like the ww2 one that was released some time ago. Nice idea tho.<br><br>Sorry for the ladder thing. Thought it shouldn't be too easy to get into the building.<br><br>It's not so easy to find a good voice. I think Rob's is pretty cool (eg: "is that all you got?"), after all it's an amateur project, so for me this is ok. Tho, I agree, "you shouldn't play with the big boys" is only funny when spoken by a woman (as it was in prev. demos). we kind of missed this detail.<br><br>Thanks for your comments. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Need a break these days. I think I get blind from staring at the screen too long time and probably from drilling holes in the ceil without protection glasses...<br><br>Yes the ladder. The Lionhead fence that has no collision is a map design mistake. Also, sorry for the missing textures. As I mentioned before this is a common problem of blitz, since it will try to load it from the full path (if it's stored in the mesh) when it can't find the texture in the meshes folder. Tho, some may consider this a feature, it's often the reason for missing texures in releases. The best way to prevent this is: open your meshes in notepad, check out if there are any full paths, if so go to that directory and rename it temporarily, then test the game again and see if there are missing textures.<br><br>I have fixed this and will upload it tomorrow or so.<br><br><br>Actualy the grass engine was released years ago (see my grass demo in the archives). The thing that makes it looking good (imho) is A) the underlying texture will disguise the grass quads bottom seam pretty much, and B) the adaption of the lightmapping (as described on the page) that is looking higly plastic when you're in motion. This would look rather impressive in a rain forest, probably with volumetric or pseudovolumetric light ray meshes. Although, you need to fight lots of Z-Sorting issues when there's so much alpha in the scene. The mystery of manual Z-sorting is your only friend here.<br><br>For those who are purchasing a licese these days, note I am currently updating the publisher distribution to version 8, so you'll get version 7 now and version 8 in the next weeks.<br><br>Good to see it's working on most machines. I used BMP "cutscenes" for max compatibility. DirectShow can "play" them, although MoviePlaying doesn't seem to return zero when it reached the "end" of the "movie", so I had to work around this detail, btw.<br><br>Thanks everybody! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It seems since the addition of your vegetation system, everything has slowed down a lot more than it should. Now on a old video card like a GeForce 2, the slowdown is probably normal, but when the same demo runs on a video card with extremely fast vertex/pixel processing capabilities, the same slowdown occurs (and of course is not good for someone who is used to their video card's high speed).<br><br>Since Blitz3D doesn't support vertex shaders (of course), grass animation means that every vertex of the grass has to be re-uploaded to the video card each frame, and I'm guessing that this may be the main cause of the poor performance. Newer video cards are so fast that this creates a bottleneck and slows everything else down, meaning 99% of the time you're uploading vertex data to the video card, and 1% of the time you're video card is actually rendering something.<br><br>So I would try disabling grass animations (just to see if it helps), and if you're not already, grouping grass into batches of several thousand polygons - drawing each grass quad as a single entity (even if you use CopyEntity) will absolutely slow down everything no matter how fast your computer is.<br><br><br>Developing a fast vegetation rendering system takes a <i>lot</i> of time and effort, so I guess it really depends how much time you want to spend on it. In your case, like you said it's not really an outdoor engine, so it's not that important.<br><br>P.S. But if you ever want to use C++ to develop a game with advanced vegetation rendering, I would recommend Ogre (free) + my <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/wiki/index.php/PagedGeometry_Engine" target="_blank">vegetation system</a> add-on (free) [<a href="http://www.bundysoft.com/coppermine/albums/userpics/normal_TropicVista3.jpg" target="_blank">image</a> | <a href="http://www.alsbonsai.com/john/Jungle.wmv" target="_blank">video</a>]. :D <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
