For example the icons at the top of the on-game screen, the clock's black outline isn't antialiased very well and some of the other icons don't have a "designed by artist" look (no.2 what is it? and no4 the flare flame is dodgy).  The menu system is interesting, but somehow it feels cramped and like a tech demo.  I think it cos the text is stretched to fill the box instead of being the same pitch on each one, not sure this works.  The text on the menus has an inconsistant black outline, it's not that well anti-aliased.  Just a small thing, the "S" in "audio Settings" and on "Start Menu" has a funny little two pixel grey strip to the top left of it.  The green boxes on the options pages look inconsistant.  I know this is because they are cubes viewed from a slightly different perspective, but it looks funny to me anyway :-)  In game the pulsing sun and asteroid have dithering around them, how can this be on my video card Redeon 9800XT 256MB RAM, Direct X9.0c?<br><br>Some other points I noticed:<br><br>It would be better if the demo galaxy flashes or something so you don't have to move the mouse over them all to work out that Craite is one to go to.<br><br>With the walls and floors the same on Schitz, it's hard to see what is a wall and not a ceiling, maybe just a different shade would make all the difference.<br><br>To reply to previous points:<br><br>My monitor is slow to change, it's a 19" Iiyama CRT, so I only see the second O followed by B at the start.  Lots of big CRTs have a switching time.<br><br>A different click sound for positive would be better than no sound I think.<br><br>re mouse, sure I canr educe the sensitivity but perhaps the default should be less.  Also reducing it won't stop rough movements/skipping, games like Quake etc have mouse smoothing/ramping that seems to make all the movements really nice.  I just think maybe this is worth looking into.<br><br>Hey keep on going though.  You must have learnt so much over the past 2 years.  Anyway my next game will be release as beta on this site in two weeks so you can get your own back ;-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
