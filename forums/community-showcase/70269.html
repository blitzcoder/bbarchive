After a board is finished, the player is given a letter grade; "A", "B", "C", "D", or "F." Multiple boards gain in difficulty for fast play, and the boards.info file can easily be modified for additional boards and play time.<br><br><b>Example Screenshot:</b><br><img src="http://www.hoppingstone.com/pics_puzld1/big_screen4.jpg"><br><br>You can find out more about Hopping Stone Games and our productions, as well as <b>try out this game by visiting www.hoppingstone.com</b><br><br>Thank you for your support, and we're looking forward to recieving your critiques! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

We thought that having the bonus points for directions and lineups would make things more strategic, but it didn't seem to work.
