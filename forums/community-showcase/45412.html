For example, by default the entire image is selected.  But you usually do not want to make a 1280x960 texture.  You want to scale the selected area down to 256x256 or something. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That looks nice and keeps the user on the page, but I almost ALWAYS hold ctrl while I click and click every image on a page to open them all at once in seperate tabs.  That doesn't work if you use Java to open your images, I just end up with a bunch of blank pages!  And, if people like me have turned off Java completely, because companies have found away around the pop up window blocker in Mozilla, then we won't be able to open the screenshots at all.<br><br>Also, when I mouse over the images, I can only see in my browser status bar that it is a java link.  I can't see where it is actually going to go.  So there is no way for me to tell if the image is going to open a new browser, a pop up window, or what.  I can't tell if I'm going to get a screenshot, or a page with more information.  When I click on the "Market Value" image I'm not exactly interested in seeing a big version of what amounts to cover art and tells me nothing about the gameplay.  I was hoping for more info about the game.  <br><br>Also you break your own scrolling rule as every page on your site has to scroll.  Just "not a lot".  But that's silly.  Scrolling is scrolling, and mine isn't a exactly 10 pages tall. :-)<br><br>Overall I like your site design though, it looks nice.<br><br><br>Black:<br>Terrible, terrible, terrible. :-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Excellent samples, and I like the way you've presented them in before/after/tiled fashion.  ...Glad to see you've removed that nonsense about not many features being a selling point.  :)<br><br>I like this design best:<br>www.seamlesstexturegenerator.com/stg-006.png<br><br>...although, I would probably drop the alternate colors for first letters: STG.  Just go all-gold.  Very often, a simpler design looks sharper, while too much fussiness can get tacky.  Don't over-complicate your color pallette.  I'm sure you must've seen Fredborg's website for gile[s]--I think that's a very slick design.  If you stick with those colors--blue, gold and silver (and black &amp; white)--as much as you can throughout the site, you should have a tasteful and lively design.<br><br>I do prefer site designs that fit vertically into the browser's space, as in Keyboard's design.  This takes a bit more doing as you figure out how to squeeze all your info into a page,  but it does make for a more attractive layout.<br><br>But anyway...!  I was coming to this thread to give feedback about the program itself!  ...Utterly superb results.  Regardless of the site, I'm already sold.  I'll buy it sooner or later.<br><br>One small feature that would be very useful would be the ability to zoom in/out of the original image.  I've got a bunch of texture photos that are really huge.  They work great in this program, but it's a pain scrolling all over the place and not being able to see the image all at once.  The mouse wheel would be my favorite control to use.<br><br>Here's an idea that could add some power to the transformation gadget:  Curve handles to let you make the sample are convex or concave, and thus compensate for wide angle lens distortion.<br><br>...anyway, great work! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So it would not make sense to put curvature modifiers on the quad.  It would however make sense to have a slider perhaps which would "pinch" the source image inwards to compensate for curvature, and I could do that in a preprocessing step before I do the quad math which I don't understand. :-)<br><br>Another reason it is better to do it as a preprocessing step is because it would be faster to adjust that first and make surte you get it right, and then muck about with the quad.
