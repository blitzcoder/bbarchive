I think its an art form , that one could relate to making a seamless texture, but for models. So they can be sprayed all over without causing that repeating look you have above in your shot. I'm no artist, but it looks like thier grass blades go up and hang over in one direction alot, where yours are up and down almost without any hang/tilt at all.  I would wager if the more horizontal curve a blade had, the more it would blend with neighboring grass models.<br><br>I know crisis is a very high bar to compare to, but I went to your forums and it appears its your comparison of choice, thats why I used it here.
