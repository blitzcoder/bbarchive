It does a very poor job of antialiasing as a result.  Plus it changes the size of the image which though neccessary if you want to avoid clipping causes headaches with positioning things, because the resulting image doesn't always end up an even width.<br><br>My function rotates even sized images properly with or without antialising.  Futhermore, when antialising it uses a cosine based interpolation.  What that means is that if it is closer to the center of one pixel than to the center of another, instead of simply interpolating them linearly, it "weights" the one it is closer to so that it affects the final pixel color more.  In a way, it is a blend of a pure antialiased image, and a pure non antialised image.  This results in slightly less smooth lines, but they're also slightly less blurry, and the colors stay more saturated.<br><br>I've been thinking about adding these functions to my BOB system.<br><br><br>LineOf7s:<br>"But hey, you know what Scorched Earth games involve. Do that."<br><br>Well they're all a little different.  I'm trying to find the best balance.  Things you might not think are important can have big impacts on how fun the game is.  Like how you aim for example.  I was going to make it so you just move the mouse and click to fire, but I decided that is too simple.  Though it would make the game fast paced, aiming that way just doesn't feel fun.  I may instead make it so you have to click a button to change the angle, and then you move the mouse to adjust the angle.  Or I may make it so you have to aim using the keyboard.  I suspect casual gamers would prefer to aim with the mouse though.  Aiming with the keyboard in Worms is fun though. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So far I've only crated this new set of graphics.  I had another version which had daytime graphics, but I wasn't happy with the daytime look.  If I manage to stay focused on it, then I might be able to finish it in a couple months like the texture generator.  The program should be easier to write, but the graphics and sounds will probably take up the extra time.<br><br>The reason I don't finish up one of those other projects is because they'd take more time to finish than this, and this is more likely to sell well.  <br><br>My dad intends to move to Florida at the end of this year, amd I won't be going with him.

I have done a lot of research into shareware and tested loads of games.  What is good is that one man can make a shareware game unlike a 3D epic that takes 20 people and loads of money.  It doesn't even have to be that good if you can market it correctly!  You can sell a shareware game on your own (if you avoid publishers who take a big cut) and you don't have any distribution costs associated with selling it in shops.  I emailed some sucessful companies inc. the developer of Platypus (the shoot 'em up, he was really nice) and found out that a good shareware game may sell 10,000 - 20,000 copies in a year.  At $20 each, I'll let you do the maths ... If my game sells for only $10 and I only sell 5,000 copies, well I'll still be happy, then I'll make a level pack and more games!<br><br>The important thing seems to be to stay focused and not give in with poor sales.  i.e. don't work on loads of projects at once (I used to do this as it's fun!), focus on a clear goal and work to achieving it.  That is what I am trying to do now, so wish me luck ;-)<br><br>As a matter of interest (for research purposes), I would like to hear your sales figures for your apps.  Obviously you may not want to post them online but you can email them to me if you feel like it, I really am interested.<br><br>regards <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
