Even really good optimizing tools take a lot of "massaging" (tweaking values, scrubbing detail settings, etc.) to get halfway decent results.  This assumes the model is a good candidate for optimizing in the first place (eg. a dense mesh of nearly coplanar polygons.)  The default optimize modifier in 3D Studio Max hasn't got a prayer.<br><br>I've done a LOT of polygon reduction so I know the tricks; I've worked for several clients who insisted on purchasing high pol models from Viewpoint or Turbosquid and had me reduce the polygon counts even though I pointed out that it would be faster and look better for me to just model the objects from scratch at low resolution.  Usually I use some combination of Multires and Polychop (both tools preserve texture coordinates) but since I don't own 3D Studio Max I had to use some free tools which munch polygons pretty well but screw up texture.<br><br>Oh, and I got it down to around 23,000 polygons for the scene.  Considering there are 22 pieces that's about 1,000 polygons per piece.  Assuming the chess set is pretty much all that is onscreen (for a chess videogame that makes sense but for a chess game within a larger videogame that won't be the case) that should be a good poly count.<br><br>****<br><br>Malice, are you going to need texture coordinates?  If not I won't waste my time but if you want to apply any textures (something like marble or wood to indicate what the pieces are made of) it shouldn't be hard for me to throw on some mapping planes and cylindrical mappings.<br><br>Note that you really wouldn't want to ship with these models.  These are fine for testing and/or freeware but there are a lot of little errors.  There's a reason 3D Cafe is giving them away for free ;)  For example while reducing I noticed the meshes have a lot of cracks and seams. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Even I can model a chess set, though I would never claim to be as fast at building a new model as applying optimizations to a high poly one. :-)<br><br>Oh and I know how to "massage" a model too, but I wasn't about to spend several hours selecting individual sections of the chess peices and optimizing them, I'm not being paid for this. :-)  <br><br>I took a look at your optimizations and you kinda mangled the base of the peices.  Of course beggars can't be choosers, but I'm not the one looking for the chess peices.  So I can be a chooser. :-)  That mangling of the base is why I didn't go down below an optimization of 6 degrees.<br><br>If I was more skilled with Max, then I would consider modelling new peices for him, but I'm not that good with it and it would take me hours to do some of the more complex peices like the knight or the castle.  The others can be done with a surface revolution.  Though I suppose it might be easier to work with primitives and try to hack sommething together since I don't know how to make shapes or do lathing. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

However, if you intend to sell this as shareware, then you should aim at low end systems.<br><br>You MIGHT be able to just squeak by with 60K polygons on a TNT2 card.  Your framerate won't be spectacular though.  Of coruse, I could be mistaken.  I am basing my estimate on a test I did with 50,000 trees on a Blitz terrain a while back.  Now that I think about it, that would be between 100-200K polygons, and Blitz terrains are slow as hell.<br><br>Sooooo maybe 60K polygons for a chess game is a realistic benchmark to aim for.  But it may not run so hot on the systems of people who still have Voodoo 2's. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
