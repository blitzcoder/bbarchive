There is no reason to "rush out" game for game while staying on the same level in other areas.<br><br>Maybe you have learned things when coding the game, so it might sound more harsh than needed - but for myself it is very hard to even bothering to try out all of your games - because of their look. For me they look as if they were done on a lazy sunday. <br><br>I did not say your game(play) is bad, but the presentation is just far away from what you could achieve by just trying.

Mainsworthy makes a game about defending a battleship against Zero attacks and calls it "Pearl Harbor Zero Attack."  It makes sense and in no way is offensive, even though it isn't exactly an accurate simulation.  Your statement is over-the-top idiocy, and shows more of your character than anything.  To link from Pearl Harbor to Hiltler's Pizza ovens just shows you are way too sensitive.<br><br>What about BlitzBasic? Are you offended by that name?  If not, why not?  I would think that a product named after the devastating bombing of London by  German Nazis would be far more offensive to someone from the UK than anything about Pearl Harbor.<br><br>@Mainsworthy.  Tried the game.  Find the concept interesting, but I got bored quickly.  Since the game is on a gaming site, I'd assume it is a finished product, but graphics look like placeholders.  It gives the feel of an unfinished game.  There were also times when the planes/flack seemed to fly right through the Zeros.  Possibly because one step, they are one square away and the next step, they just swap places.  You need to check for that condition, unless that is part of the game play to time your planes and flack to be two squares away. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It has entered the English vernacular from the Blitzkrieg style of German warfare in WWII and the Blitz bombings in London.  It is used to compare the swiftness of your (product, procedure, idea, etc...) with how swiftly the German army would defeat its opponents. I personally do not find the term offensive despite its origins.  WWII was a long time ago and the term is deeply rooted into our language.  I just don't understand how someone can be so offended by the use of a historical event in a game, yet the blanket use of another historical event (in which 588 times more civilians were killed) is completely okay with him.  <br><br>There is also a huge difference between an inaccurate portrayal of history such as Mainsworthy's game, and a complete twisting of historical events such as Hitler selling pizzas or legalized slavery in modern times.  Also,  trying to win an argument by comparing historical events to recent killings is completely in bad taste.  Obviously Adam is not worried about being offended as he seems to be going out of his way to be offensive.  Makes me believe he is only offended as it gives him something convenient to attack Mainsworthy's game. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
