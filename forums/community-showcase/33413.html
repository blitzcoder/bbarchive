Well, it seems to hard for some of my units to fire, I think you should make them attack, if there are anything within range (they don't always do so now, it might be a bug). They seem to be blocked by each other very often, and they ain't good at coming around it, try making smaller collision areas for a start. The animations still look like crap. The enemy AI probably needs to be more objective orienteered. I'm not shure about the unit balance yet, but it should be so that tanks are good vs infantry, infantry vs large robots, and large robots vs tanks, right?<br><br>I won my first game, and the second one was simply too easy, but keep it up, the game could get good some day :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I think you should win when you hold all of the objectives, not 4 turns after. Mark the visible area, so you know where enemies might hide. Try to make the AI not bomb itself with the artillery strikes. Move the camera further up, and make it look down on the field, just a suggestion. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Currently they cycle through all the enemy units at a rate of about 8 units per frame, which means it can take some time for it to pick a target - I will see what I can do about that.  UPDATE - Have increased it to 12 units per frame that the units cycle through so should be 1.5 times quicker at targeting.  Note though that infantry will not target tanks unless they have a chance of killing them - ie when another tank or robot has damaged them already.<br><br><br>Not too sure what to do about the pathfinding.  The units are able to find their way around obstacles like buildings and rocks but trees are a huge problem for tanks at the moment.<br><br>I agree that the animations are pretty bad... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Perchance my algorithm should be changed for selecting the targets.  Currently each unit that does not have a target will iterate through all enemy units (over the course of a few frames) in order to find any targets within range.  If I increase the number of targets cycled through per frame then the game really slows down.  I would be more than happy to find out about a better targeting algorithm.  However because of the way that multiplayer works (recently uploaded a patch which fixes a problem when playing against someone with a slow internet connection - MAV occurred due to one PC going ahead with something before it was ready..) it is essential that each player's simulation runs exactly the same on both PCs which I manage by writing the code in such a way that the same path is taken through the code on both PCs...and therefore if I were to adjust the "targets per frame" variable based on game frame rates then the simulations would differ.<br><br>If you can let me know a better way I would be interested to hear. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Just delay the action on the client side.<br><br>And by the way, there is somthing you haven't taken into account about the sprite infantry, when they are close to the edge of the screen they will appear to be turned, so they basically don't face the way they walk. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Previously when I thought of this I thought it would take too much effort on my part to do so, but I think now I could probably work it out much better.  Initially the game was going to be real time, and I was having too much trouble with the synchronizing issues so made it turn based, but I think I could precalc everything now.  <br><br>Also - yes I should fix the sprites when they are near the edge of the screen.  <br><br>I am going to make some major changes I think - such as precalculating the turn.<br><br>Thanks <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
