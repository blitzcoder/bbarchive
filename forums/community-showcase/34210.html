You will have to play a few levels to get the feel of what the game is about./Edit<br><br>This is a demo of a work in progress.  I would like your opinions of if it's worth completing or if I should shelve it or modify it in some way.  Could you please try it out and tell me what you think.  Please ignore the poor quality graphics/sounds used in this demo.  I am only concerned about feedback regarding the following questions:<br><br>1. Do you think the makers of Tetris would find reason to sue?<br>2. Does it feel original?<br>3. Is it too easy or hard (or just right)?<br>4. Is it fun?<br>5. Is it addictive?<br>6. Does it have replay value?<br>7. Were you able to figure out how to play and what to do?<br>8. What would you change to make it better?<br>And lastly,<br>9. Does it have potential?<br><br><br>PLEASE NOTE the following things before you play!<br>-- The graphics/sounds are temporary.  Please do not judge the graphics/sounds.  I am only interested in comments on gameplay.<br>-- The game will only play in 1024x768.  I have hardly optimized ANY drawing operations.  There are some graphical glitches.<br>-- I have ripped out all of the music because it wasn't finished and because I don't want it being copied.<br>-- There are some minor bugs, ignore them.  Please don't comment on any bugs.<br>-- Don't tamper with any of the files or the game will most likely not work.  This includes the .ini file.<br>-- The only options on the Options screen that work are the top two (drop sound, and # of words).  Technically, the music option works, but you shouldn't mess with it unless you hear some weird 'music' playing.  If you do hear some 'music' then please DO let me know (it's not working on my system at the moment).<br>-- I haven't bothered to explain the rules of the game because I want to know how easy/hard it is to just 'pick up the game and play'.  Edit: if you can't (or don't want to) figure it out, then scroll down a few posts to see the instructions that I later posted.<br><br>Thanks for your comments.<br><br>Here is the game:<br><a href="http://home.cmit.net/rwolbeck/dbs/dbs.zip" target="_blank">http://home.cmit.net/rwolbeck/dbs/dbs.zip</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If a shape lands on and covers a square that is of a different color, that square on the puzzle side is only cracked.

During the second round of a level: If a shape lands on and covers a square that is of the same color or covers a cracked square (of any color), that square on the puzzle side is broken (revealed).<br><br>4. However, During the second round of a level: If a shape lands on and covers a square that is of a different color (but not cracked), that square on the puzzle side is 'X'd out.  An 'X'd out square can no longer be revealed (because there is no third round).<br><br><br>Hope this helps. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Unfortunately, pictures don't work out as well as word phrases do.  The reason being, suppose I had up a picture of a dog.  A player uncovers enough of it to see that it's a dog, so he writes in 'dog' as the answer.  But what if he writes in 'daschund' or 'hounddog' or 'puppy'?  I can't be able to answer EVERY possible phrase he could type in.  I don't think I could give him multiple choice either because that would basically give away the answer.  I don't think pictures will work that well.<br><br>I did however have an idea using flags.  I have about 80 country flags that I have created that could be the backdrop for the puzzle board.  The player could then try to guess the country based on the flag.  I thought this could be a bonus thing.  There could be several ways I could do something like this. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
