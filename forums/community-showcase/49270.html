My main idea is that there are two types of missile. one that shoots in your face direction , and another that locks onto any roid that close and home's into it.<br><br>I havent put them in because I wasnt sure if they should be a suppliment to your main guns, and just have a missile fire off for every 3 bullet shots, or have them as a main wep and you have them till you pick something else up, or have them on a limited supply so if you pick up missiles you only have like 10 and then revert back to your main gun...<br><br>More ideas feed back on these missile plans would be good cos at this stage id really prefer to know exactly what im going to do with them before i code anything.<br><br>Your mines tho, How exactly do you feel they would work ? I imagine that you drop a mine, and if a roid hits it then the roid and mine blow ? is the mine safe to the player or deadly to both.. more info on what you were thinking about here pls.<br><br>Either way thanks for the feedback..<br>More pls :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
