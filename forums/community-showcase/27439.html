Please read the "Version History.txt" file for a full rundown of all fixes, additions and changes.<br><br>Anyway grab ProPixel v1.51 now!<br><a href="http://www.blitzcoder.com/cgi-bin/showcase/showcase_showentry.pl?id=snarty05122003205212&amp;comments=no" target="_blank">Download &amp; Showcase</a><br><br><img src="http://www.pacificsoftware.btinternet.co.uk/im/newlookpp.png"><br><br>Thank you to everyone so far who are supporting myself and ProPixel. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It will be based around the core eliments of ProPixel with two extra tabs (Anim and Sprite). Both tabs with be fully featured with tools designed to aid each area. Not to mention being able to easily pass images to and from each area. (and yes onion skinning will be there)<br><br>Following that I have ProPixel Studio planned, but more on that another time ;)<br><br>I'm pleased you like this standard version though :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I've tryed several time to replicate the error, but no chance.<br><br>2) would be really nice if you can add another behaviour while using the brush. Right now, the brush is always drawn with its background, while would be useful if the brush is drawn using the brush transparency - I mean, the transparent color of the brus should not be drawn.<br><br>If I have a brush with a sprite and a pink background, and I draw such brush on a image which has a green background, then there's no way to paint the brush without its background rectangle which surrounds the brush itself. Of course, if the image background has the same color of the brush background, you don't see it..<br><br>So, with the 'matte' tool, the brush appears to have the transparency background only if the image background has the same brush background color - I hope I explained it in a comprehensive way..!!<br><br>To clarify, you know that in Blitz, using drawimage, you can draw an image on any backround, while the images transparent color is not drawn. This is the feature I would like to see in ProPixel..<br><br>3) You use CTRL-Z to undo. This is valid on a UK keyboard. On a german keyboard, the Z key is located at the Y place, while the Y key is located at the Z place. So, to undo using a german keyboard - which is what I'm using now - I have to press CTRL-Y instead of CTRL-Z.<br><br>So, a nice feature would be the possibility to redefine the hot keys, and also to assign any possible function tool to any key combination.<br><br>4) When I select a brush mode, I have no way to know which one is selected, unless I don't draw the brush on the image.<br><br>Would be nice to see, in the status panel, a short but comprehensive description about the tool currently in use.<br><br>Also, if I use the nuber keys (1-0) to select a brush, if I press the number button twice, the brush is displayed with a filled rectangle. Pressing the same number again, the brush returns to be displayed as 'normal'.<br><br>5) The filled rectangle tool does not work like the normal rectangle tool, I mean, while you move the mouse, the filled rectangle grows in both x and y directions, while in the normal rectangle tool, the rectangle dimension is locked to the mouse position, as it should be.<br><br>6) ProPixel seems to work only on two images at the same time. Is this only a demo limitation ?<br><br>7) Would be nice to select a brush from a list of brush images, instead of loading from disk each time.<br><br>Thanks for your attention,<br>Sergio. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Right now, the brush is always drawn with its background, <br></div><br>Ok, generally speaking, what ever the colour is held by the Right mouse button, that will be used for transparency. To change this after cutting a brush or loading one, Select "Brush &gt; Brush Manipulation", when the window pops up you will see various brush options, one will be change trasparency, click that button and which ever colour is held by the right mouse button will become the new transparency. Also, click "Dock", many people seem to like all windows Tabbed.<br><br><div class="quote"> 3) You use CTRL-Z to undo.

Ensure you have Filled Rect selected. Currently I'm unable to repeate this.<br><br><div class="quote"> 6) ProPixel seems to work only on two images at the same time. Is this only a demo limitation ? <br></div><br>This is currently a version restriction, as ProPixel2D is the low end product in a range that is being developed over the next year or so, ProPixel Animator and ProPixel Studio will be far more flexible. PP2D is aimed to be simple to use, though, don't rule out full multi-image loading in future updates as it's bigger brothers will have this.<br><br><div class="quote"> 7) Would be nice to select a brush from a list of brush images <br></div><br>As mentioned before, this is only a version restriction, and, as with full multi-image support don't rule out PP2D eventually having multi-brush support.<br><br>I hope this answers your questions, and I'm pleased you like it so far. :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
