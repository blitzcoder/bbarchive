What that suggests to me is that a) lots of people want a piece of the action and b) lots of customers are easily sold on something that `looks different` or `looks cute` rather than is necessarily deep in the gameplay department.

I particularly liked Spandex Force which had a number of different approaches to matching the blocks, plus tied it all together with a nice city concept with people to click on and stuff, plus it was fun. However I would say that there didn't used to really be match 3 games, there just used to be `puzzle games`, and puzzle games were often quite different to each other in terms of what the puzzle involved and what you had to do to complete it. Back in the Amiga days there were quite a number of different kinds of puzzles, and I don't recall there ever being a match 3 game. It's almost as if someone made a single type of puzzle game and then everyone focussed on it so much that it blew it up into a giant market. So on the one hand I do still feel that `in the bigger picture` match 3 is only 1 type of puzzle which has been significantly duplicated, although within the context of match 3 games there has been a lot of work done to create the impression of differences, mainly based on appearances, how you move the blocks, what special features are present, particle effects, music, etc. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The intro should either have slow creepy music matches the visuals and builds up to a crescendo on the crash zoom in, or you should make it all happen in at least half the time.  Making it slow and quiet doesn't make it spooky so any impact of the sound effects is kinda lost.<br><br>On the first level I clicked one tile and the level played itself to the end, because the tiles which dropped in just sorted themselves out.  The second time I played it took 2 clicks to end the level - surely this is too quick?<br><br>At the moment the title screen is more attractive than the in game screen which is where the player will spend most of their time.<br><br>To make this less so, I'd love to see some animation in the backgrounds for example, the witch could fly passed across the background not be stuck in a static image in the background.  Maybe on later levels she could cast a spell or two across the board?  The spiders web should shake and a spider drop in or something.  There shoud be fog moving across the bottom, and a few scudding clouds could move across the moon, or better still reveal it.  A storm could be brewing, clouds could get darker and the background could change brightness or colour or something.  I do not believe that this would be distracting, but it would seriously add to the atmosphere.<br><br>I think that when you ask for a hint the timer should loose some time or there should be some kind of balance against getting a hint, you know what I mean?<br><br>I would make the cursor a skeletons hand or something a little more spooky.  Simple things will greatly improve a not bad first match 3 game.<br><br>As for a comparison to "Holiday Bonus" I don't think these games can be considered as being in the same league!  <br><br>There's no innovation or real creativity here, main tile gfx are ok, but the hand drawn style is only a little above home grown, but nothing more.  Sounds effects are few and far between and just adequate. Music is competent and sparse. There's little in the way of design in the game as a whole, its just a direct use of GA's framework.  It would be a great example game to 'chuck' into the framework package to show how it can be done.<br><br>Holdiay Bonus graphics, music, sound effects, animation, particle effects, presentation were all far superior to anything shown here.  There simply is no comparison except that they use a match 3 mechanic and GA's framework.<br><br>Download the 'Holiday Bonus' demo and check it out if you don't know what I am talking about!<br><br>IPete2. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I tried the hint button and one of the tiles spun around, but there was no match possible with that tile.
