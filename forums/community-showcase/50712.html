You need a better backdrop.  I'm not liking the red color.  I'd go for a blue.  Red makes me angry!<br><br>The graphics look skillfully done though.  The trike looks very nice.<br><br>The words "main menu" at the top of the main menu have the M and the U cut off halfway on the left and right respectively.  Also the font is just plain white.  The whole menu needs something.  I'd make bugger buttons coming off the left side of the screen, of different lengths maybe.  I'd look at some racing game menus for ideas.<br><br>When I changed the resolution on the options menu it didn't tell me that the resolution change only affects the game itself and not the menus.  Or maybe it just doesn't work, I don't know yet.  I restarted the game and the menu looks the same.<br><br>I would make the options screen appear on the right side of the screen and move the trike over to the left with a camera pan when changing menus.  It would look more professional and wouldn't be confusing them the identical looking menu soddenly changes to appear longer when it's actually a different menu.<br><br>I notice you still have the defualt Blitz icon on the EXE and title bar.<br><br>The help button doesn't appear to work.<br><br>Okay now to play!<br><br>Graphics impress, but I don't like the arrow being drawin in front of the sail.<br><br>Off the starting line all the other racers take off, and I'm left sitting there moving along at a snail's pace.  I don't have any idea what to do.  Can I move the sail into the wind?  I don't know.  Arrows appear to turn the vehicle.  I find that by rocking back and forth I seem to gain speed or maybe I have just turned so the wind it behind me?  I don't know.  <br><br>Oh I've just noticed that weird dial on the bottom of the screen is indicating wind direction.  That's not very intutitive.  It looks like water flowing.  <br><br>I've having a very difficult time controlling the vehicle.  OR more specifically, I'm having a hard time actually catching the wind so I can actually go to each of the checkpoints.  I still wonder if there's any way to turn the sail.  I haven't found one.<br><br>Annnd... I've given up.  It's not fun getitng stuck on a hill and being unable to actually make the vehicle seem to go any way I turn.  I don't know anything about using one of these things, but I assume that the sail is supposed to be perpendicular to the flow of the wind, but the way the bike is set up that appears to be impossible to achieve while still having the wheels turned in that direction.<br><br>I'd say what you need to improve this game is twofold.  <br><br>1. You need some kind of a help system to explain how to play the game as the player is playing it.  Tell the player what they need to do on the screen at the start of the race so they can make the car go fast.<br><br>2. Cheat.  <br><br>Make a beginner, normal and expert mode.  On beginner and normal mode give the vehicle some formwar dvelocity by default no matter which way the player is facing.  Less on normal than beginner.  Just enough so they can actually turn around and get off a hill if need be to get back on track.  <br><br>Also, cheat the wind.  On the beginner and normal modes, make the wind blow towards the next goal, more or less, that way as long as the player points themselves in that direction they will move towards it.  If you require the player to rock the controls back and forth to gain speed, then that can be added speed on top of that, so there'll still be some skill involved and you don't have to make the wind point in exactly the right direction.<br><br>In short, the game is way too hard right now, and it's not hard in a fun way.  It's hard not because the enemies are smart but because I can't move.  Not being able to move kills the whole game.  At least if I was getting my ass handed to me by more skilled enemy players then I would feel that it was my fault and not the game's that I'm doing badly, but this type of thing I blame the game developer for.<br><br>I think the game is definitely salvageable.  You might want to have some more stuff on the terrain though.  I didn't get to drive around much so I didn't get to see if there were any trees or plants or buildings, or cars sitting around, but I'd advise adding those things.  Just having a barren landscape might be realistic, and a salt flat might be okay for one level, but I think the player would want to see some more details, whatever those might be.  <br><br>Also I'd change that wind direction indicator.  An arrow... a wind sock...  Something other than what looks like flowing water. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I seem to be having some luck with this that others aren't.  I'm actually having to let the AI players have a lil head start so I can chase them down.  :o) <br><br>Quick tips (I'll give mouse controls since that's what I've been using and I've only just discovered there's a readme file with key mappings in it):<br><br>As soon as you start, pull your sail in tight (left mouse).  Go through the gate and turn right to face the next gate (you can see the big yellow circle with an arrow in it down the bottom of the hill, or you can just aim the red arrow in the reticule bottom-left toward north).  Let your sail out so it's almost perpendicular with the wind direction (right mouse).  Stay like that until you get through the gate.<br><br>Once you're through that gate, it's easy.  Pull your sail all the way in tight again.  Depending on wind strength (obviously) you'll whizz along.  You don't need to change the sail position again until you've gone through the next gate and the start/finish gate.  By then you'll be going so fast that you'll likely tip over when you turn right, so bear that in mind as you approach the gate (ie take a different angle through it, or perhaps let your sail out a lil to slow you down a tad).<br><br>There's only three gates on this course, so continue ad infinitum (or until you've gone around as many laps as you set).<br><br>And yes, everything Mr Swift said about the menu is true, but I didn't mention it since it's 'gone gold' and is in essence a done deal.  For the sequel though, a lil pizazz would be appropriate.<br><br>From the readme.txt:<br><div class="quote"> For more detailed information please refer to the 'data\instructions\instructions.pdf'<br>file stored in the games installation folder. <br></div><br>Perhaps have that PDF file linked to the Help button?  Or at least installed as a link in the start menu with the game.  Having people read that would address the "WTF?!  *MOVE* dammit!!" issues.  Which are never fun. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Won my second race (would have come second in the first (9 AI's) but AI Seven needs to die ...mkay).  Third race I caught up with the backmarkers and even though I put some of the field on 100% I still won by over 30 seconds.  Perhaps have an option to start Grand Prix fashion and make the player come through the field.  Higher max AI count might also help.<br><br>Longer races would be nice, was it just a demo limit?<br><br>If it goes retail then online matchmaking might be quite cool, does the full version have multiplayer?<br><br>I was using mouse, but I saw no mouse sensitivity control so high dpi mouse users may find it unuseable as it was quite sensitive to start with and my mouse is quite sucky really.<br><br>Didn't try force feedback wheel (if your game has support I can try it out?)<br><br>Not absolutely sure on this but I think on the menus when you expand an option it blocks other buttons and the menus do not compress if you click outside of the menu unless you select another menu option - thus blocking other buttons, which effects the ease of navigation in the menus.<br><br>It might benefit from a more "event" feel with a qualifying, larger field, and longer race.  Have other Blo-Karts circulating in the qualifying perhaps so it doesn't feel like other race games when you qualify alone and just cant wait to get to the race.  It might work well for 20-30 lap races.  I like endurance btw - did I mention I wanted longer races ... but only with a better AI, as it was no challenge.<br><br>In short:<br><br>Great game.  Bad music.  Great graphics.  Please add Longer races, more AI's, tougher AI's, multiplayer and online server listings or centralised event server.<br><br>Oh yes, and I absolutely refuse to race in any colour other than red because it goes faster... Can the player setup screen allow me to choose my colours?<br><br>EDIT: Also the main menu would look a lot better if you added the game name logo to the top right. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I see two quick solutions to this:  One is to change the menu description of wind level to also include a description of global difficulty setting: ie: (Low wind = hard / High wind = easy) etc.  Another solution might be to give the AI's a simple acceleration/top speed boost based upon the wind factor, it wouldn't actually need much so hopefully wont be visible to the player that the AI is using cheat physics.<br><br>There is one issue of concern though, and I cannot be 100% sure if i'm right or not.  The new version appears to have a lower framerate.  I didn't try it without any AI ( I used the full 9 AI slots ) but I did compare it to the old version under lowish graphics settings and it does seem to be a lower frame rate - but I cannot be completely sure, as there is no onscreen display i'm going by "feel".<br><br>I'm using an AMD 2200+ Ghz processor, 512mb 133Mhz Ram and a GeForce 5200 graphics card.  I previously ran 1280x1024 with 9 AI and high detail and also it wasn't silky slick I felt it was accepteable, this time I thought "hmmm, I need to cut back the detail setting".<br><br>Maybe it's just the nights sleep which has made the difference.<br><br>Suggestion for replay mode:<br><br>Each "interval" award each blokart a point for position, 10pts for 1st down to 1pt for 10th.  On an interval there is an overtake award 100*position points and add 99*position for the interval either side and so on.  On an interval where there is a roll or impact with scenery add 250*position points and 249*position for the interval before and 248*position for the interval after and so on down to 1 point.  For intervals where the blowkart is off the ground double the points awarded.<br><br>Use these points to show which blowkart to follow when in replay mode and you've got yourself a televised race ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Having said that, the inclusion of variable wind will completely despoil such a feature.<br><br>Cheekily I might do a bit better if I could customise my joystick controls ;)  I'm using Interface atm which lets me use my wheel but puts the sail control on a pedal, I think I might preffer it on a button because it's hard to keep the sail in position when going down wind.  Selecting joystick didn't seem to give me any kind of sail control on my joystick drivers (seperate Y and Z axis for throttle/brake pedal and no buttons responded.  I have a 9 button controller).<br><br>The good news is I did find the slight wind a geniune challenge, I havn't done many races yet and i've got some coding of my own to do but the difficulty did seem about right to me under those wind conditions.  I will let you know more when i've done more races.<br><br>The thing about difficulty I think is important to remember, is that as a programmer we get to be pretty good at our games - but there's always some schmuk out there on the internet who can thrash us.  I've found before that I can only deliver about 85-90% of the performance of other players around the internet, so that's generally how I guage my own single player difficulty settings.  When I make a game, it has to beet me at the upper level.<br><br>At the same time it is important not to put the game beyond reach of the 90% of players who wont come close to that difficulty, so a game has to start easy.<br><br>Your lucky in this project the difficulty settings are very much up to the player, but in an arcade game or something then difficulty becomes more of a problem - as an easy start can make a game dull - in that situation it's important to very quickly start to ramp up the difficulty,  most games fail in this respect and make their easy levels last too long which is dull. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The sail can get stuck in irons which requires a quick turn to the right to flop it over, then ocassionally (partly due to control method and partly because of the nature of the game) I loose my hold on the sail being flat to the wind and end up crossed over.  If the sail hangs out the right hand side I leave it there figuring 80% is better than 100% for a moment and 50% for the rest.<br><br>Approaching the first turn I actively try to keep the sail flat to the wind as I gently turn, now we get to the first interesting bit.  The next turn is about 20 degrees to the right of the wind.<br><br>I therefore sail flat to the wind, aiming 20 degrees left of the turn.  As I get past half way I start a gentle turn.  This has the benefit of giving me better windage when I accelerate, getting me well out of the way of the other races and also giving me a gentler angle of attack for the bend ahead.<br><br>As I start my turn, about half way down the strait, I am very very gently changing my angle of attack into the bend and by the time I reach it probably have about 40 degrees more shallow an angle to take the bend with than the AI's who sail up to it than turn.<br><br>Unfortunately this narrows the gap for me to sail through and can result in a quick left/right flick to avoid hitting the turn obstacle which wastes the whole effort - but overall the risk is worth taking.<br><br>As I said toward the last turn marker the angle I take is dependant upon my mommentum.  If I have lost mommentum on turn 2 then I aim right of the finish turn.  If I have done ok then I aim directly at the finish turn.<br><br>This is because the wind is 20 degrees or so right of the turn marker so I accelerate faster keeping flat to the wind rather than sailing at the turn marker - but if I already have speed then I save myself more time by sailing directly at the finished line because it is a right hand turn and I want the turn to be as shallow as possible.<br><br>As I get 1/3 to 1/2 way down the strait I tack left and start aiming left of the finish turn.  My speed now will be extremely high even if I lost mommentum on the previous bend as accerating flat to the wind on this part of the course has a huge effect.<br><br>Once i've tacked a little left I begin my turn.  If I am going too fast I let my sail out before I reach the bend and i'll take a very wide exit, loosing a lot of time over distance but saving time via mommentum.  If i'm lucky i'll get the sail position right and not loose too much time.<br><br>If i'm able to turn shallow and head toward the second turn marker soon after rounding the finish turn then I will have made up about 5 seconds on the turn.<br><br><div class="quote"> You like Geoff Crammond so i'm guessing you are / were 'into' driving games - i'm a huge fan of Live for Speed <br></div><br>I'm a huge race fan, it's in my blood.  My family have a line of racing drivers so I suppose you could say i'm a bit like the girl from the new Herbie film - except she's prettier and i'm not reliant on a magic car... ;)<br><br>I like racing games generally, my favourites are those which allow me to do an "event" rather than a quick race.  I like to qualify, I like to feel the atmosphere of a race weekend, I like to tweek setup and I dont like doing laps as the only car on the track so other vehicles have to be out in qualifying - infact finding an empty bit of track should be half of the art of qualifying.<br><br>I like races that are long enough to have strategy, so if I scale the race length back to 30% distance and i'm doing a Formula One game I still want to have to make pitstops - so I like it when tyre wear and fuel rate are also scaled back to 30% to match the race length.<br><br>I think doing an AI for a driving game is much easier than a sailing game because driving games feature static conditions from lap to lap.  Sailing games are reliant on the wind which is changeable... You can teach the computer to sail better to the wind or sail better for the track - but making it do both is a real challenge.<br><br>I have never ever written a "cheat" AI, my AI's always use the same physics functions as my players but in this instance I would be tempted to cheat and just give them a speed boost.<br><br><div class="quote"> I don't suppose you are after huge numbers of AI in Ww but if you did, perhaps some sailing Ai would be useful, any thoughts ? <br></div><br>My current AI is broken, when it worked it was very crude indeed and not capable of racing.  I do plan on putting an AI in of sorts - I have a plan for WW only a handful of players are aware of, a racing and simulator game isn't the final destination of the project - it's simply a handy stepping stone ;).<br><br>I dont think I could write a shared AI though, the way I program is very ungeneric and specifically optimised to the task at hand.  I dont generally write "library" functions and I rarely use libraried functions of other people either - only if I cannot figure something out for myself do I do that.  Which is why my sails work very differently to yours ;)... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's not as if anyone other than Empress Rebecca with have any political power no matter what title they dream up for themselves... ;)<br><br>I think in a real land yachting race you'd probably win though as I probably lack the arm strength to hold the sail on a strong wind, I might have a few traditionally male past times as interests but i'm not butch ! lol.<br><br>I didn't like Grand Prix Legends at first, it took me a long time to figure out that the default setups where so badly screwed up that the reason I kept crashing was because the car literally was undriveable, they'd even set the cars up with toe out which was just rediculous.  Once I realised the default setups had been botched and changed them I found the game more controllable, but by then games where appearing with force feedback and it just didn't have any.<br><br>It's the same reason I went off Geoff Cramond's Formula One Grand Prix games which did have FF support but where so badly written configuring the controller took 8 weeks of persistent tinkering and was still undriveable and felt about as realistic as a Spectrum game.<br><br>For the most part I am with you when it comes to AI, when you are at the very limit of performance the difference between a good AI and a bad AI really shows up, getting a wee bit more acceleration down or achieving slightly more mommentum through a bend and you have a chance to pull an overtake out of the hat - but that level of competetiveness requires a longer race, it's why real Grand Prix run for 70 odd laps and not 15 like lesser formula's.  Are you sure that's where you want to take SimSail?<br><br>I think to achieve that sort of level of competetiveness requires the AI to learn from the player, pre-programmed decision weighting can never hope to recreate the same feel.  Not only does a learning AI help set the difficulty level and negates exploitation of unseeable circuit nuances by having the AI's use the same exploits, but most importantly it gives all players the experience of racing at the very top level even if they're - to put it politely - aweful. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
