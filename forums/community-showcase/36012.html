Now that I'm leaving for a week of vacation and Storm is has skipped pretty much completely to OpenGL (in preparation for BlitzMax), I felt it'd be a waste not to show you people any of the old engine material. So without further delay, here's the goodies, the last shots where taken pretty quickly so if you think they are lacking, feel free to bitch about it and troll all over the topic! ;P<br><br>The first semi-public Storm Engine shot, showing a lake, some trees and a StormTerain (this was taken 4 months ago):<br><img src="http://server6.uploadit.org/files/Helkus-storm.jpg"><br><br>3 Shots taken today from the prototype MapEditor for StormGL, this editor covers a full production pipeline for natural and organic maps, using an intermediate weighted voxel representation to create any 3d shapes required with easy tools. Interface/console are hidden in the screenshots.<br><img src="http://server6.uploadit.org/files/Helkus-canyon1.jpg"><br><br>The editor allows for loading heightmaps, saving final products into several 3d formats and reducing polycount to the exact desired ammount automaticaly.<br><img src="http://server6.uploadit.org/files/Helkus-canyon2.jpg"><br><br>The terrain shown in these 3 screenshots was created in under 3 minutes using only add/substract brushes and configurable soil layers, the UV mapping is 100% automated and virtualy artifact free, using only 1 surface per texture.<br><img src="http://server6.uploadit.org/files/Helkus-canyon3.jpg"><br><br>Due to the responses I've had about the voxel based part of the MapEditor and it's capabilities I am concidering to release it as a seperate tool, should there be enough intrest. So if you like and/or would concider to buy a tool that performs the above functionalities and more, speak up... ;)<br><br>I hope you enjoyed the show, should responses be positive, you may get a deeper peek next week, when I return from vacation. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Should people want the editor (and some seem to) and what they can see/read it will do for them, then I'll turn this prototype editor into a demo and a full version. Which is on the grand scale of things, still quite a bit of work. So if people aren't interested I'll have saved myself some trouble, if they are I'll have some insurance that this is actualy worthwhile to finish before continuing StormGL.<br><br>And BotBuilder, I didn't get your mail, but I'll mail you as soon as I'm back from vacation. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You'll have to wait a bit for that. But due to the reasonably positive feedback I've had I have decided to do the following when I get back:<br><br>-Release a demo of a simple landscape built in the editor, which will feature maybe a few climate settings. (something which takes but a few clicks in the editor) Due to popular request I may add a little sneak peek at the Storm Liquid system to that demo. (the cool looking lake :P)<br>-Build and release a fully functional, non save enabled demo of the voxel map system as well as a save enabled full version. If not in the first release the ability to add models and lightmap the whole level will be added shortly as this tool will eventualy become the main level editor for the StormGL engine. This editor will not only save to the simple b3d format, but also to a more advanced Storm3D format, that upon release will allow it to be loaded into the StormGL engine, which will unlike a simple B3D export allow for complete realtime deformation of your maps (Think Worms3D on a 5x5 square mile map ;), inside the game as well as automated LOD and culling functions!<br>-Since this system will also ship with StormGL, any buyers will be supplied with a UserID that will grant them a discount on their purchase of the StormGL engine of the same amount as the price of this map editor. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In screenshots 3 and 4, for example, why is there that line of light and darkness all the way around the level?  Especially in #3, since the sun (the actual source of light)is clearly visible BEHIND the cliff being illuminated.<br><br>Was this merely an example of the person using Storm not taking into account the skybox when placing the light source?  Does storm even DO the lighting, or did you use a different tool for that?<br><br>I would instantly buy this tool without a second thought, just based on the screenshots, if it cost around 20 bucks.  If I got a demo in my hands and I could figure out exactly what it does and doesn't do, then depending on the functionality and features, I might go as high as 50 bucks.  I'm an independant, spare-time developer and Blitz is just a hobby to me.  There are a lot of tools out there, and I prefer to stick to the free ones, but this one may be worth purchasing for my terrains.<br><br>By the way, if all your artists are clammoring to be the guy working on terrains because the tool is so nice, then you should teach the tool to make indoor maps and 3D models, too. :P<br><br>The indoor maps part wouldn't be too hard... just teach it to use cubes instead of spheres as the basic shape, and add features from there as requested.  Creating a humanoid or monster model with this tool might not be too difficult, either... just add a function that can be used to force bilateral symetry. :)  Of course, animation would be another story... and I'm looking at it from an oversimplified perspective.

Since this is still Blitz3D and thus not a pixel shader, it will look far more impressive in StormGL, but this should still function fine as a fallback system on lower end systems. The storm design aims to offer multiple levels of backup systems for every main component, so when you want dynamic water it'll run on a GF2 as well as on the latest radeon, without forcing you to worry about it! It just changes to cubemap mode rather then a reflect/refract shader. Anyways, I'll be home soon and then things will really get interesting... :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
