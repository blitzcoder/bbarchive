I wanted a cool feeling of speed and movement in a pretty boring realistic space background.  Some systems don't have the clouds &amp; lightning (the nebula).<br><br>Finally, the crash (damn you crash, damn you!) is caused by a redundant call to the BVM beta version function which I started using to add mini-games to the trade consoles.
