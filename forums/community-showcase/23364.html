Simple but very effective and proffesional looking graphics. Takes me back to my ninty64 years ^^ Really I love it!<br>Second, this was the first thing that 'bugged' me. You don't have some options that can say for example adjust the screen resolution and colordepth. And you can't adjust the keys on the keyboard.<br>Third, I might have missed this one so if I'm wrong please don't note this remark. There is only one camera 'mode'. I couldn't adjust the camera to view my character from a little higher, or from further behind or something. You should at least make two views possible. One more close and the other more away.<br>Fourth, where's the music? Might not be in here cos it's a small demo I think ^^ But I really missed a funky happy theme song, could you make another demo with music perhaps? ^^<br>Last but not least. I dunno that's all I quess. It looks good, playes good, feels good, sounds good (the sfx ^^). It's top notch (apart from the remarks above ^^). Great work! This can easily be one of the best Blitz games out there! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I thought the graphics and sound were well done, and the music was just fine. Overall the game had a great nintendo feel to it -very appealling.<br><br>The control is very inuitive, in fact I loved the way you turn round corners and let the inertia carry you round. I also liked the fact that I didnt have to concentrate on braking all the time (well 'at all' actually), it made it easier to get into, but this also left me wondering about a possible lack of depth in the full game.<br><br>I wouldnt say the game is too hard, but I didnt enjoy the way the CPU players seemed to go faster then you. Am I right in saying that if a cpu is abit behind you they get a little extra speed to catch up? coz they seemed to overtake me easily even tho i was going full pelt on a straigt(they werent going booster speed), or perhaps iniertia doesnt effect them as much on corners? I would think many players would consider this unfair.<br><br>I personally find more enjoyment in winning a race because Ive taken corners more efficiently. There obviously was an element of this but as soon as I hugged a corner perfectly the cpu players overtook me straight away and stayed just ahead until the next corner -I felt totally dependant on boosters. Althought this was alot more evident on race2 where I could only manage 2nd.<br><br>In diddy kong racing you could easily lap the cpu, which gave you a nice feeling of dominance :D I cant see that happening here(although admittedly theres only 2 laps on the second race which doesnt give u much chance anyway).<br><br>Also one last thing, I didnt see any race or lap times? One reason I kept playing diddy was so I could try and better myself. I find it very odd that for a racing game it lacks this.<br><br>Still, well done for managing to finish a cool game, something i can only aspire to atm! nice 1. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I don't like the menus.  Too plain, and menu text is too small.  Would look better with a blue background than a white background.  It looks like an application, not a game.  It needs something animating in the background too.  Stuff flying by, or spining lines... anyhting.<br><br>2. It's too hard.  This is not because the other players are too fast, but because you don't seem to have the kind of "drafting" effect that games like Mario Kart have where you go faster when you are farther behind so you can catch up.  In your game if you make one mistake at the start of a race, then you have no chance of winning.<br><br>This is also because the tracks themselves are poorly marked.  The first time I played I got last place because I went off the track into the water right at the start because I couldn't see a turn coming up.<br><br>And this is because the jet boards are much too sensitive to turning inputs from the keyboard.  If I press the arrow just breifly, the board turns a lot.  You need to implemnet accleration in the turning input, so that when you first  start turning it turns at say, 90 degrees per second, and over the course of half a second this accelerates to 180 degrees per second.  This allows for fine adjustments, while not bogging the player down when they want to turn sharply.<br><br>3. It would be more fun if instead of starting out with three nitros, you either had to pick up the nitros, or if you started out with no nitros, but got one additional nitro each lap.  I suggest the first approach though.<br><br>4. The character select screen does not show you which players are not available in the shareware version until you attempt to select them.<br><br>5. The level selection screen does show this, but only with a big red X.  It would be better to tell the player "not available in shareware version"  or "register to get this level".  Because I'm not even positive that those X's aren't there because I haven't completed the test track in first place.  But I'm guessing that's not the case.<br><br>6. You really need more than a total of 5 levels.  You really should have more like 10 levels and give the player 2 in the shareware.  Of course, it would be far better to have 15 levels, 5 each per "circuit" and give the player one complete circuit in the shareware.  You could also offer an additional bonus circuit with 5 more tracks for an additional $5.  People will pay for that.<br><br>7. When I finish a race and press fire I hear new music, and menu sounds, and can start a race, but I don't see a menu.<br><br>8. You need a title screen.  An in game screenshot edited in photoshop would work fine.  You just need to set a camera up from a low angle, pointing up, pointing towards a dfirection which the players will come from and then take a screenshot witha bunch of them and one guy really close.  That would look cool enough.  And as a bonus, you could overlay the main menu over that with a transparent black square and that would look pretty cool.<br><br>9. You've got an awful lot of logos at the start of the game, and some of them go by pretty fast.  It would be better if you could keep the number of logs down to three tops, two would be better.<br><br>10. Providing a little more feedback to the player when turning, by showing little side jets firing would be good.<br><br>11. As epicboy suggested, having jumps would be cool.  You don't need to have the players do tricks of course.  The jumps could provide a short cut or something.  Like in Mario Kart 64, on Koopa Troopa Beach, jumps allow you to grab items in the air (like those nitros I mentioned) or to jump over boulders.<br><br><br>Don't make the mistake of deciding the game is "good enough".

What happens exactly. The race finishes and the screen goes blank?"<br><br>No, I just hear new music and menu sounds.  Everyhting else remains the same.  I still see the course, and rider.  I'm not sure but I might see a thin line appear at the top of the screen too.  Unless that's always there.<br><br>"thats what the trails are there for. They show the actual direction you are moving in."<br><br>That's not good enough.  Obviously the trail shows you where you've been, but it does not instantaneously provide feedback that you have pressed the turn button.  You should get a visual, and a change in sound.  Play F-Zero for the N64 or SNES.  You'll see the rudder move, and the noise the ship makes change.  <br><br>Speaking of the noise the ship makes, do your hoverboards even make noise?  I don't recall hearing any now that I think about it.<br><br><br>"-- Where did you read that? There are 4 grandprixs each with 16 tracks in the full game."<br><br>Well obviously I didn't read it in your game! :-) <br><br>I saw the first screen showed five levels, and I couldn't finish the first race, and I didn't get to see that "you didn't do well enough to advance to the next level" screen.  <br><br>As a shareware game you need to have screens and stuff which say "get all this when you register!"  And you should show that there are more circuits on the level selection screen.  Of course maybe you DO have a screen when you quit the game that shows this stuff but I never got to that point.<br><br>"Although I would have thought the four screenshots of vastly different tracks on each of the four grandprixs would have given you a small hint."<br><br>Were there four screenshots on that first screen?  I thought there were five.  Anyhow, I thought those were LEVELS, not whole circuits.  I don't remember seeing anyhting which indicated to me those screenshots represented groups of levels.  In Mario Kart, you have a circuit selection screen, and then you have a screen where you select the actual track to race on.  Though there is a game mode you can play where you go through a whole circuit so you don't get the individual level secreen.<br><br>"That is there. The further behind you get the slower your opponents go."<br><br>Well it wasn't enough to let me catch up. :-)<br><br><br>"Buy the full game. There are a couple of tracks that involve jumping off of cliffs/ down the side of steep hills."<br><br>I (the consumer) will not buy the full game unless the demo shows me that the full game will be fun.  Of course you are supposed to hold some stuff back, but not major gameplay elements.  <br><br>Your shareware version makes me think that the game lacks any weapons, has no jumps, and no way to gain additional nitros.  The only thing to do is drive around the track with some racing physics which while fun, are somewhat lacking.  Play F-Zero and see how they make the game fun even though there are no weapons.  You take damage when you hit the sides of the track, and can go over glowing track segments to gain back life.  Each lap you get another nitro.  The ships accelerate over time to get moving very fast, and can go over jumps and explode when you fly off the track.  You can turn, but you can also strafe side to side which gives you more control and makes turning more fun.  There are also differences in how fast you go over certain sections of track which makes it a challenge to stay on the fastest terrain.<br><br>I am not trying to detract from your game, I'm trying to help you by offering suggestions on things which would improve it and make it sell more.  Obviously each game is different, and you should not make a game exactly like wipeout, or exaclty like fzero, but you have to have more to the game besides simply driving around the track.  This is clearly not a simulation of real racing. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There is a lot of potential there, you just need to exploit it.<br><br>The graphics are good atm, and nothing needs doing to the basic formula.<br><br>Here are a few suggestions:<br><br>- Weapons or powerups of some kind or other<br>- More dynamic levels<br>- Sort the difficulty out.  There should be a very smooth learning curve in the shareware.  The first track should be very easy to win, the second should be medium, and the third challenging but not overly difficult.  Extreme difficuly even on "Rookie" level is sure to deter punters.<br>- Assume the customer knows nothing about the product before he first looks at it.  Had I not read your worklog, I would have been confused about the Grand Prix / Levels.<br><br>Give the shareware version a good variety of levels too, you may have noticed, but games rarely give you say, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd levels of a game in the demo, they give you the 1st,4th and 7th for example. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Overall, I really enjoyed the game, but I too can't get out of the game screen, and was plagued by all of the other players being faster than me, and unable to catch up. Once I'm in the game, I can't get any other GUI to come up.. I can hear the music change and the sound FX of the menu system, and even somehow managed to start a new game without being able to see the menu screen.

Because it had "Firestarter".  If it had graphics which weren't designed by a well known techno art desgin house and regular music, it would have gotten poor reviews because the gameplay was terrible.<br><br>Besides which, Wipeout at least had weapons.  And you could catch up to your enemies.<br><br>One thing this game has going for it over Wipeout though is that the tracks are really wide.  In Wipeout you would lose tons of speed hitting the sides of the track which was so annoying.  FZero is so much better than Wipeout. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There is nothing more frustrating than seeing the other racers zoom past me without using their boosts when I'm going full speed along a straight part of the track.<br><br>I also think that there is too much inertia on the hoverboard. Sure, the inertia makes things initially interesting, but sliding helplessly into the water or a barrier just adds to the already growing frustration factor. I'm sure that with lots of practice I would get used to the intertia, but I doubt that the average gamer would keep playing this game long enough to reach that point.<br><br>Sorry to be so negative, but the only reason I've even taken the time to think about the problems with your game and post this is because of the fact that there is something about it that I really like.

Binary, i am sure your a great guy  and support your work, but somethings i want to say (but dont take offence).<br><br>The game itself is well presented, your website is stylish and professional in a "modern" way. The demo was a small download but wortwhile. I booted the game, and went to options and noticed limited amount of control over options. A resolution selector might not be suitable as you mention, but at least make the config in an ini file so it can edited if really needed.<br><br>The graphics are clean and well presented but blande. Their isnt anything intresting to look at and i quickly got bored (no pun intended!) of driving round the standard track with no intresting effects to view. While you probably went for the "compatible" with all  option, i believe even the N64 had more effects in DKR than your demo has. The demo track did nothing to intrest me, and i was looking forward to your game. The lack of physics (ramps, etc) also makes things less intresting, again all gameplay aspects...<br><br>The music, shouldn't be midi, were not in the DOS days. Who cares if the demo is 6mb download, with a decent track playing while racing would make it all alot better. Midi Music dosent kick it no more. Its like listening to a polyphonic ringtone.<br><br>Keep at it, i cant say anything because i haven't completed a full game. But just my two cents... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
