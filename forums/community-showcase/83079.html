While this is the 3rd game that we've released, it marks the first one that we've developed using BlitzPlus.<br><br>  BlackJack Dash! combines the simplicity of solitaire with the high stakes action of BlackJack! It's a mad dash to the finish as you race against the clock in each round to win as much money as you can by creating hands that equal 21! And if you're fast enough and good enough you just might make it into the BlackJack Dash! High Rollers Suite! But be careful that you don't go bust along the way and end up losing all of your hard earned winnings!<br><br>  BlackJack Dash! retails for $9.99US. For more info and to download a FREE trial version, please visit the<a href="http://www.tinyfrogware.com/prodBlackJack.htm" target="_blank"> BlackJack! Dash</a> home page at <a href="http://www.tinyfrogware.com" target="_blank">Tiny FrogWare</a><br><br>  As a side note, BlitzPlus made development much easier than any of our previous games and we will be using it exclusively for development of all of our future games.<br><br>Thanks!<br><br> Tony. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

What can I do that my competitors can't do as well?<br><br>There are many many freeware card games out there. Many people's first games are simple card games. I'm not saying don't sell your game I'm saying find a niche and fill it. Do what hasn't been done or atleast hasn't been done at the cost of 9.99 usd. <br><br>Good luck the game has potential. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I appreciate it.<br><br>@Plash: The 1's and 0's concept came from programming...ie bits, binary, coding, etc. But I do agree that I need to rethink the web site design.<br><br>@Sauer: B+ was perfect for this project. Using it made development faster and easier than my other two games, where I used a different compiler. I see myself adding other Blitz products to my toolbox in the future.<br><br>@Jesse: I made an installer so it would be easy for those that don't understand how to simply unzip a file. Perhaps I will make a zip version available. As for the $9.99 price. It's easier to start high and then lower the price and/or run promotions and discounts. :-)<br><br>@Ryan: Thanks for the great feedback. BlackJack Dash! has a lot more potential. I have quite a few ideas on enhancing the game play with a variety of playing styles and options. There will certainly be future versions that implement these ideas.<br><br>Again, thanks for taking the time to give me some feedback. I'm going to rethink my web site design. If anyone has any ideas and/or can suggest a decent web template, then please let me know. As for the game itself, I'm going to keep improving it, but wanted to get it out there to at least get some feedback.<br><br>Thanks. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
