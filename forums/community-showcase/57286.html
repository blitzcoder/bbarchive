Constantly shifting left and right is tiring and makes it hard to focus.   I would do two things to fix this.<br><br>1)  Implement a simple 'push' scroll where the horizontal movement only kicks in when the bearing is in the left or right 20% of the screen.   This means if you simply let go of the controls the screen will stop scrolling where the gap is less than 60%.<br><br>2) Auto-detect the width of the current gap (the two extremes of the bearings horizontal movement)  and set the camera to simply point at the mid-point.   This will deal elegantly with gaps up to a full screen width.   If the gap is bigger then fall back on the push scroll - or simply don't have gaps that big. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Point 2 though is interesting, though and I'll look into it.<br><br>I was also thinking of drawing an alpha line through the horizontal line of the ball to give an indication as to what you'll hit.

I was hoping people might like the simple but unique-ish gameplay (It's from a 20 year old 8-bit game called croco magneto) more so than the visuals. I loved that game as a youngster and thought it would make a perfect pick up and play casual game.<br><br>As for the graphics I've created sets of standard blocks (14 per set), these are then placed in the editor which automatically flips/rotates them together to make the correct look. This means I can just lay a block next to another and those two blocks will combine using the correct basic model. These are also applied to a heightmap which gives the irregular up and down shapes.<br><br>Next time I upload a demo (probably 1-2 weeks) I'll include the editor.<br><br>The level in this demo probably took an hour to lay out.

I would remove the stuff underneath the main plane and add a floor.  Or make the stuff underneath really blurred out, maybe as if the floor was translucent or something.<br><br>-  There's a lot of cool gizmos that would be cool to interact with, rather than just being eye candy.  It's as if the cool things (the spinning cranes, etc) aren't relevant but the boring stuff is (crates).  <br><br>-  The back-and-forth mechanic is interesting, but I'm not sure it fits the theme.  With this kind of level design and the fact that you're a ball really implies that you should be able to determine your own angle.  I would use a more traditional control scheme, but achieve your "mania inducing" gameplay by making cool gizmos that fling you around and boost your speed, etc.  <br><br>- I finished the level, but I never had a good feel for what I was trying to do or how I was progressing (clicking on Instructions in the menu just froze the game.)<br><br>Otherwise, I like the theme a lot and the presentation is awesome so far. I think it just needs more iterating on the game mechanics.<br><br>Good luck,<br>Joe <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The original idea was the screen looks confusing until you play it, when such incidental backgrounds are visually ignored by the player. Bit like Tempest 2000. I have an idea that may work for this<br><br>2 - Most of those moving gizmos will drop stuff, fire stuff or generally harm. The crates are there to block things, and other blocks will be used for other things too.<br><br>3 - Yes the back and forth mechanic was the original game back in the 80's. Changing it to a pure angle rotation thing will cause other issues like losing the player (and ruins the layout of my boss level). I do have an partial solution that may work though, which I will try.<br><br>And yes more I plan more power-ups like speed boosts etc<br><br>4 - I hope that the "knowing what you're doing" part will be solved by easing the player in with simple levels first. Once you know you have to collect the rings and get to the Portal 'Oh my god I ripped off Sonic!' then it becomes more obvious. I also plan an arrow that points to the nearest Ring<br><br>I'll work on this and then put it up in a new thread in a few days. Thanks for your help <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
