I cannot imagine people paying attention whether their payment system disallows payments from special countries. Exception is if someone asks or hints them.<br><br>It is even discussable if one should be allowed to sell amories to certain states (they are sometimes as democratic as our countries - but they are not situated in northern america or western europe - so they cannot stomp with their feets). You as civilian are not allowed to to - but big companies still do it using 3rd party assistants. Secret services use it too to have controles "situations" in other countries... But... I know, as long as you live in a country, you have to accept its rules (or try to change them...uhmmhm yes...).<br><br>So you Americans are proud to are not able to sell a software to a specific country - so to avoid that your old best friends but now most hated people are able to program their own "training software" ... hmm I somehow am getting sick now. Maybe that bad bad terrorists are even illegally copying software...<br><br><br>@game trailer:<br>This does not look "AAA", it looks "A". The graphics somehow reminded me to trailers from the last generations of consoles or GTA4. Especially the shadow of the jumping dude (sun from the top right, shadow down to the left) - why was that so sharp edged? Did one even think about good looking shadows? In reality you only have really visible shadows with a strong shining sun - else you just get up to nothing plus a bit of darker nuances.<br>The environment looks "dull" and uninspired (flat, less details, blocky...).<br>The scene with the top-view on a landscape looked really nice.<br><br>Nethertheless, it looks way more impressive than things I am able to do but it has a taste of "aged" instead of "top notch". Sure you can use that as a reference title but there is surely enough air on top for improvement (games, not your engine which I haven't tested or checked).<br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
