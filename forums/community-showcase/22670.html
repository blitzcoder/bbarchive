I know from experience that sometimes you can get your proportions bang on according to the books and it just looks wrong. I've had to go back and rescale things a bit even though they were anatomically correct before, just to get it looking right.<br><br>In this case ( and you're right it *could* just be perspective ) I would say the arms are a bit too long and too thin. They need a bit more shape below the elbow, and quite a lot more shape between the shoulder and elbow. I know you're not going comic book, but a soldier is going to have some decent biceps.<br><br>Either the head needs to be a bit smaller or the torso needs to be a bit bigger. Particularly he needs a broader chest.<br><br>It's difficult to judge the legs from this perspective.<br><br>I hope that doesn't sound like a lot of criticism for such a great model, but it's actually a backhanded compliment. If I didn't think it was such a great model, I'd just say "yeah, it's nice." It's only because it's so good that I think it's worth taking the extra time and making it perfect. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I sat down with my wife last night and took a hard look at it with her.  We cracked open the anatomy books, and the "how to draw your favorite human figures/comic characters etc... references.

I downloaded Island Storm when you posted it a while back, and was really impressed (you gotta love it when a game gives you motion sickness, but you still churn thru 'cause you want to keep playing)..  I found the vehicles a little difficult to control, and the enemies were a little tough to kill, but overall it was an awesome piece of work!!!  Once completed you should consider publishing!

As for the clothing, I'm going to have a couple of skins I think.  My Dad just dropped by (retired Maj USAF), and mentioned that there are occasions where they will use jungle camo tees, but not often.  Mearrin69's right in that they use a brown t, and actually within the last 2 years have allowed a plain black t-shirt (at least for USAF, I don't know about other services).  So, I think I'll create a few more skins to cover the board.  That should satisfy most. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
