Here are a few thoughts.  I'm a developer talking to you Xylvan, so I won't muck around and give you whimpy feedback.  I'll be straight up with you.<br><br>The good stuff...<br><br>- The music is nice.  It's quite calming... I'm not sure I could imagine anything that'd suit the game more.<br><br>- The soundfx aren't horrible.  There were clicks and a few other small issues, but they weren't irritating.  Well done on that.  I quite liked Candy's squeaky jump sound.<br><br>- There's the makings of a good kids game in Candy World Tome II.<br><br><br>The bad stuff...<br><br>- The gameplay is horrible.  Candy clips through characters, objects... and it's not at all clear what it is you're supposed to be doing.  A tutorial might help here (which lists the controls and objectives), but the game is about as fun as holding down the forward arrow key on my keyboard in every application I have to see what happens.  I wonder if your team knows what fun is, because right now this game is not fun.  The game plays like a bad job.<br><br>- The setup screen is a mess.  It looks nasty and cheap, and it took me a while to work out options could be changed with mouse clicks.  You need to improve how it looks.<br><br>- Whoever is making your menu screen graphics needs to go to design school.  If it's you, then you need to go to design school.  Flouro green, pink, and powerpoint-like slides just look ugly.  If your target market is 2 year old kids then you're doing well... but I don't think it is, and because of that no publisher will look at this game twice.  Some of the 3D models look decent (for a kids game) but the menus and installer backdrop are so ugly I wanted to cry.  If you like the graphics- great.  But, if you're going to sell the game to <i>other people</i>, you need to make graphics that'll appeal to them.  Right now, these graphics will not.  Find out what your target market likes and develop your game to look like that... and please, get some artistic training!<br><br>- Hire someone to fix the broken english in the game.  It makes you look unprofessional.<br><br>- The collision detection method against the size of the map looks ugly.<br><br>- The collision against the bones is too large.<br><br>- Candy's model stops walking every now and then after another animation (the happy spin, or whatever it is) plays.  If Candy sits and then runs, the walking animation doesn't play.  These are basic, basic issues to spot.  You need to learn to notice them!<br><br><br>I could go on, but suffice to say the negatives outweigh the positives.  The game could be good for kids (the idea is really good... I know a few kids that'd get right into it), but even budget kids games have Candy World Tome II beaten.  They look better, sound better, and are more fun to play.<br><br>You need to learn how to evaluate your own game better.  Don't release a demo until the game is of higher quality, and don't work on another game until this one is much improved.  That's my advice.  No publisher worth their salt will consider a game like this until it's much, much improved.  Get a decent artist (or get some proper training) and learn to find the issues in your own game before talking about publishers. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There is absolutely nothing in the bottom 40% or so the color space, everything is shifted to the bright side.<br><br>The practical effect of that is the extremely washed-out look, with little to no 'depth' -- which is bad, especially since you keep touting the 'realism' of your models and world, and the use of color space really isn't helping you there.  But even if you're going for a non-realistic 'cartoonly' look it misses the boat -- it would need to be more vibrant for that.<br><br>I *strongly* suggest that you do a proper calibration of your monitor, because right now I have a hard time believing that you didn't notice that yourself....<br><br>One last thought:it sounds a bit silly to keep announcing 'final' releases of your programs when you continue to change it around and keep milking them.  I'm not saying that you shouldn't continue to work on and improve things (far from it), but maybe more realistic timelines would be appropriate?  No offence, but these threads look a bit like a soap opera these days.... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I also like johnnyfreak's suggestions.<br><br>Now you've posted the list, I'd like you to spend two or more days going through the game.  Take notes, and write down all the problems you see.  Don't worry about new ideas for now... just focus on technical ways you can improve the game.  An example of this might be- the way Candy slides up against the map border looks ugly.  Or, Candy clips through other characters.  Search through the game and write down a long list of any issues you find.  They could be complex issues, or simple ones.  Don't cut the process short- take a couple of days to do it.  Play the game over and over.  Write down the issue, but also how you might fix it.<br><br>Next, load up the beta version of a game like Saqqarah from <a href="http://www.codeminion.com" target="_blank">Codeminion</a>.  It's a <i>highly</i> polished game, full of professional artwork, sound and writing.  It's a simple game, but one of the best made casual games around.  Ask yourself the question- in what ways is this game better technically than mine?  What can I learn from it?  Write down your answers.  If you know of another quality game, take down notes from it as well.  Don't rip off the game's ideas (remember not to worry about ideas for now), but learn from the ways it is technically better... such as artwork, sound and menu design.<br><br>Once you've completed the list, please post it here.  I'll also post a list after yours and we can compare.  If you don't do it, myself (and I think most others on here) will leave you to go about your business without any kind of assistance.  If you do take the couple of days to make some detailed notes, I'll come back and chat to you about what you find.  The key thing is- you have to do it yourself.  No external help... just your own research.  Professional game designers (of the indie crowd) are well trained in studying their own creations.  So, consider this a little training.<br><br>Hopefully I'll see a nice list from you in two days. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Your game is coming along and it's fairly okay as-is but there is always room for improvement. I think that reasonably a game about a dog finding stuff is likely to have a young audience moreso than adults and kids tend not to notice as much things like fancy lighting or advanced texturing or whatever. But the game still needs to be easy to undertand and if kids run into problems like animation stopping working or not being able to move properly etc then they are going to be frustrated quite quickly. If there are technical problems interfering with the gameplay it isn't going to be as popular as it might be.<br><br>I think also that in order to create a good game you do need to be willing to take an *honest* look at your game from an outside vantage point. You have created this game which is close to your heart and you have sentimental attachment to it due to the story about your pet dog who passed away (if I remember rightly). It's fine to make a romantic memorial to your pet friend but people playing your game might not share the same sentiment because your dog was not their pet. This can make it seem a little as though you are making the game for yourself to memorialize your lost family member. That's fine, but for a wider audience it isn't going to make sense. The romantic pedestal that you have put the dog up on isn't going to be shared by other people and that leaves them wondering `what else is there to do in this game`. They don't see it in the same way that you do.<br><br>If you are willing, you need to take an honest look at this game, not as a romantic tribute to your doggy friend, but just as a game, alongside all other games which have nothing to do with your personal story about your family pet. That's how everyone outside of you are going to look at the game. I'm sorry to say most people are not going to `get` the meaning which it holds for you personally. If you look at your game honestly and evaluate it as a game, not as your personal dream about your dog, then this honest looking will show you what you need to do to improve it for other people, so that you can make this a game FOR other people. When people are telling you that various things about your game need to be improved, it can *sound like* judgement or criticism, and it can sound like it cuts down the soft-spot that you have for your dog, but just because you might've made some mistakes or not finished polishing some parts of your game, doesn't mean you are bad or wrong, just that there is still some work to do to make it the best it can be.<br><br>It's important to listen to what people are saying and be willing to accept that they might be right, so that you can be open minded enough to accept useful help. Help and advice doesn't always sound positive and it might not always be something you want to listen to or follow but it's easy to interpret people's comments as criticism when they are trying to help. Of course some people are just being very judgemental and mean and it's up to you to discern who they are.<br><br>Take what you like from what they say, and leave the rest.<br><br>I do think your game needs to be improved in most of the areas that people have mentioned and I hope you will be honest enough with yourself to accept that this is good advice and to take it. It will help you to make a better game that appeals to more people, which would do your dog more justice than making a game that people find frustrating or dull. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

He tells us in the forums, but not everyone that plays his game will be getting it from the forum.  He needs to show us it in the game, not tell it to us on the forums.<br><br>In addition, like most people, I believe a tutorial level is definitely necessary.  With a small bit of work, I'm sure the first world could be turned into one.  For example, the use of a cat approaching you when you first start the game and explaining the controls, setting you on mini-missions to destroy dummy enemies, and explain why you're supposed to collect bones, pastries and whatnot would greatly help out new players and would probably stop a vast majority of the criticisms.<br><br>Well, whatever you do, if it's deciding to fix some problems with Candy World, or just continuing on the way you are, remember to have fun making the game.
