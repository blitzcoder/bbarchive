If you follow my post history on here, I was using an extremely modified version of BPLite, the free version even, as SimpleUDP and other network libs didn't work fopr me. From there I expanded and made it work bigger and bigger. Now it supports a 3D Movement Prediction System, Shared Events, Global Quests and much much more. The Server Binary is going to be replaced with a C++ program later to allow even more, like Shared NPCs.<br><br>Meanwhile In the Client you have a nearly infinite Universe with Hidden Asteroid Belts, Pirate Bases full of AI (Players have not managed to take down a purple base yet.) and soon to mone battlefields, lost resource caches and even comets.<br><br>I've been spending 15 years on this, So I pretty much know what I'm doing ;)<br><br>@Krischan: Its by no means my first project, I dabbled in AMIbasic and QBASIC with a released game and had a series of games in B3D as well. 15 Years of work are included in Sirius, and it went through many names, like "Starradon Online", "NeoCracy Online" until it landed as Sirius Online. I think you might remember me from the german BlitzForum  as Dragon2000X. Until June 2015 I didn't think my project was fit for the public, so I spent most of my time working on this, fixing, editing, adding new stuff.<br><br>EDIT: I've been trying to get your Elite Scanner to work, but, in terms of using it efficiently and performance wise i Created my own solution ;)<br><br>I have added some Images of ingame stuffy mcstuffingtons here:<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/StkxGDh.png"><br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/L3GPCZm.png"><br><br>The UI is still being worked on to transition into the new stly, seen in the Market.

Nonetheless most of the work done was rewriting things as others got obsolete or "this could be done better"-optimizations. Once "game logic" works, it is way easier to transfer to something "new". On the other hand I think "finishing first" might be the better approach to "always strive for something better" (which we developers are often living for).<br><br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
