Was I supposed to be racing against anyone lese, got a bit bored. <br></div><br><br>This game was originally designed for internet play, but for time completion and lack of hosing server reasons, the features had to be cut back.

I'd say go with 1024x768 and let people change it<br>- Car could of used a little more horsepower and the car's suspension is kinda stiff<br><br>The Ugly:<br>- Dark font in menus on dark background<br>- Ground texture is odd somehow<br>- Kinda cheap on the polygons in some places (like the checkpoint circles)<br><br><br>I know, Boiled Sweets said a lot of these but I got the same reaction <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The camera bounces around with every undulation in the terrain which might be what you were aiming for but it just feels wrong. Needs to be smoother.<br><br>The vehicle just sticks to the ground too much and does not get thrown off course really by the terrain. Just bumps along until you change direction. You can pretty much just point it at a checkpoint, hit full throttle, wait til you get there and repeat.<br><br>I dont like hitting invisible walls at the edge of play areas.<br><br>It has great potential, but is not suitably finished to be a completed game that people would pay for IMO<br><br>As said Insane set the benchmark, and still has fantastic playability years on. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Did question why the landscape needed to be rebuilt when re-racing the same level.<br><br>Didn't have problems with the water (NvidiaGT7600)<br><br>Liked the music - suitable and exciting.<br><br>I didn't have an issue with the camera - in fact it got the idea across that it's rough terrain quite nicely. Having said that, I don't play a lot of racing games.<br><br>Thought the controls might be WASD. But arrowkeys ok.<br><br>'Everything menu wise is practically illegible to me, having to press my nose against the screen to read stuff is not what I want.'<br><br>It's not what he wants. Well, f.. , no - the menu text is a little small at the default res. <br><br>Would have liked to have seen a map - particularly for the stunts level.<br><br>At one point in the stunts level, I took a dive off a cliff and my wheels came off. Thought it'd be game over at that point, but I could keep on driving - as though my wheels were still connected!<br><br>The checkpoints are a little characterless - perhaps they could appear as the big red domes they are now from a distance, but a flag becomes visible as you get near. Likewise, when first starting the game, I was confused by the grey bubbles everywhere. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
