Lots of people wanted to see scrolling so here is a vertically scrolling (with variable speed) demo-game:<br><br>[edit] There are two versions.  One rounds to the nearest pixel (but seems a tiny bit juddery as a result) and one uses floating point coords for the tiles (smoother) but has an anti-aliasing flicker on the edge of some tiles.

It was a lot harder to get the scrolling perfect on the Amiga but it was lush and smooth.)<br><br>I'll be releasing this source code with V1.03 of my BlitzMax Game Framework.  It took 4 hours (including 1.5 hours for making graphics, sounds and plugging in some of my music) - so not long.<br><br>If you want to find out more about the framework, please go here:<br><br><a href="http://www.greyaliengames.com/framework/faq.html" target="_blank">http://www.greyaliengames.com/framework/faq.html</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In a strat you may have twenty tanks/swords on one square, so the time you saved in calulating what you should draw on each squre was worth it.

Well it's not doing anything special in the exit code.  Flips from DX to OpenGL fine on mine.  You ever try any of my other games and have problems?

By default these values are set to 0 (normal) but you can boost them to 1 or 2 if you want.  A good setting is 1 on all flags; this will help if other windows programs are hogging too much CPU time.  However, a value of 1 for the PROCESS flags is not supported in Windows 95/98/ME; nothing will happen.  Also a value of 2 for the PROCESS flags may make the OS unstable.  Please see ccSetPriority in CommonCode.bmx for more information.  Note that when the game is paused or suspended (minimised or loss of focus) that the thread priority will be returned to normal.<br> <br></div> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This results in slight unsmoothness (the moire effect) as the floating point values are rounded as the tiles smooth down the screen.  If you don't round the coords before drawing the tiles, the tiles anti-alias at the edge and this gives them a flickering appearance.  I added a 1-pixel empty border to the tiles to counteract this and it looks better but is still flickery a bit - however the tiles DO move very smoothly.  So it was a choice between lush smooth + flicker or not-so-smooth and no flicker, and I chose the second one.<br><br>However, last night, thinking back to my Amiga days, I was wondering about using a pixmap twice as big as the screen and drawing the tile map to that and updating each new row Amiga-style.  Then I can draw the entire texture to the screen at a floating point coord and it'll look lush!  however, the texture would be 1200 pixels tall (bigger thanmany cards' 1024 limit), sigh, unless I had a game HUD 79 pixel tall...This would result in lush flicker free scrolling, really top quality.  But I'm worried the pixmap updating and drawing to screen could be a bit slow...<br><br>Of course I could just look the update to 60Hz and move 60 pixels per second and it would lock very nice EXCEPT that in windows mode it wouldn't be 60Hz so it would look crap.  Also you can't rely on the Hz being achieved, plus what if someone has VSync off?  That's why my framework doesn't lock anything it uses fixed rate logic and delta time.  I could removed windowed mode but no portals would accept the game. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I use BMax at a top level rather than a low level.  I gather UVs are like the top left coords within a texture that it get's drawn from there.  I do have all my tiles in one texture.  The flicker is just at the edge of the tiles which are drawn at floating point coords because BMax (well the 3D card) anti-aliases the edges, and thus two edges together don't look cool as the tiles move down through various floating point coords.  So I'm note sure how your method would get round that. My idea is to draw all the tiles (as laid of for the leve map) onto one big texture and scroll that, but continually update the big texture. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

What I mean is if I lock to 60Hz and run it on a wide range of PCs, it's not going to work well on some of them, i.e. VSync off ones or ones that force a certain Hz in certain screen modes e.g. 85Hz in 800x600.  Plus, like I said, you can't lock to 60Hz in windowed mode and if you want your game on the portals, you need a windowed mode....<br><br>Yes, the scrolling is moving at non-integer amounts per frame and rounding the y coord to draw.  It's not possible to scroll at integer amounts per frame unless you lock the Hz, which you shouldn't really do (see the first part of this post) and so on ...<br><br>It would look nicer if the inital speed on my game was &gt; 1 pixel per frame so at least it's not moving at sub 1 pixel amounts per frame. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Yeah running both game logic and FPS at 60Hz would be nice and smooth in full-screen mode on most PCs (if I only scroll in whole pixel amounts), but not in windowed mode unfortunately as it will most likely be a different FPS.  I guess that'll teach people not to run arcade games in windowed mode ;-).  My framework demo looks smooth on the purple grid because it's drawing at floating point coords and the image is actually one large image not tiled.  Maybe I'll post my floating point version of the scroller and you'll see how smooth it is, but there is a tiny flicker on the tiles...  I've look at lots of pro platform games and shooters on portals and they all have some kind of jerks (unless they are pure 3D), some don't even VSync in windowed mode (or at all!) so there's tearing which is yucky. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
