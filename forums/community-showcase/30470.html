It says you can increase your sales by an order of magnitude by placing your Buy Now button in more places and also by showing off more content that the users will experience (though it doesn't have to be playable).<br><br>I decided that a really easy demo isn't such a good thing.  Marble Blast does very well and I in fact bought it (well my brother did but I would have if he didn't) after I beat the really hard level at the end of the Gold demo.  It seems like a very good thing to have some sort of challenge in the game as it makes people spend more time with it.  As such I added a pretty difficult level which also looks spectacular.  I figure someone may not beat it their first night out, but it might possibly stop the player from wiping it off the hard drive as well. <br><br>In this new demo I've retained the original 5 levels, added a bonus challenge level and then added a non-playable video level showing off a little more of what you'll get in the whole package on top of adding a Buy Now button which is dispayed in the upper left hand corner during gameplay and can be pressed when the game is paused.<br><br>Let me know how this demo makes you feel about the game.  Does it wow you more?  The original demo was pretty tame and in this I decided to show a few of the more exciting moments the game contains.  <br><br>Does the challenge level frustrate you too much?  It's pretty deep into the game but with a gamepad and some patience my mother could beat it.  I feel the last level in the Marble Blast Gold demo is much more difficult.  What do you think?<br><br>So all the questions in line:<br><br>Does it wow you?<br><br>Does the challenge level frustrate you too much?<br><br>How much time does it take you to go through this demo?<br><br>Do you want to buy it?<br><br>If not, what would you like to see that would make you purchase the game?<br><br>If you just don't like it, what is it that you think you don't like?<br><br>We're true indie professionals at Leadfoot who are going to stick with our game until it absolutely rules.  The Blitz community already rules and we really appreciate and need all your support to help us go the distance.<br><br>Play the experiment demo here:<br><br><a href="http://www.leadfootproductions.com/Install-Aerial-Antics-Demo.exe" target="_blank">http://www.leadfootproductions.com/Install-Aerial-Antics-Demo.exe</a><br><br>(It's no longer an experiment, I've made it the normal demo to see what it does as far as conversion.)<br><br>MAKE SURE TO UNINSTALL ANY PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE DEMO! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I would consider fading the level out once the first ball has been hit, and say to the user 'please buy the full version to play the rest of the level'. Otherwise I can see too many people being frustrated by that level.<br><br>Also, I found it odd that you show the buy button while you are playing even though you can't select it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

(I thought so when you showed the pics as a WIP).<br><br>I just played the experimental demo, used the keyboard controls and they worked smoothly. Though I haven't seen the full version, I thought that jumping/flying through targets (tests) might get a bit repetitive. Perhaps promoting your flyer through the course of the game so that the flyer becomes part of a team of flyers (networked version) that go around to rescue cats from trees, babies in burning buildings, de-activating run-away nuclear reactors in military satellites. In other words mission based levels. This would also allow you to add expansion packs (levels/missions/graphics/costumes/settings), maybe a capture the flag level.<br><br>Another option/upgrade would be to allow player to select from different characters (including female flyers), and ability to change suit colors, so that player can customize flyer to suit his/her tastes.<br><br>Don't get me wrong I think the game is fine as it is, but believe that mission based flying and flyer graphic options would be a more immersive game environment, hopefully leading to more sales.<br><br>Any way I think it looks and plays terrific, best of luck!<br><br>Andy <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you really slick up an interface it almost makes you want the game before you play it!  Some games however I think rely on that polish too much.  We've been told to look at Zuma at Pop Cap.

Apart from that though I really admire you for your effort in completing this game. Its something that most of us will never do so a big well done! Every thing else is spot on but if I was making this game I would add a choice of different characters, it needn`t be many, that offered a choice of different play styles. The original PilotWings even did this. That way you could have<br>characters that are very sensitive to player input and others that respond slower. This would keep everyone happy and also add an element of stratigy to each level. Or maybe if you want to stick with the one character you could add an adjustment bar before each level like in FZero that would allow you to choose between speed or accuracy.<br><br>&gt;Bouncer<br>&gt;It did wow me, and I found the controls good.

You could play through the demo 2X easily with some leisure time to just soar.  If that's not enough then I would think they'd want the full version.  Within 10 minutes they should know if they like it and want to play more.  However, we're still testing it and I haven't decided on a final time yet.  15 minutes is a possability also. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

New players I've seen need this much time typically to play it a few times.  I can beat the whole thing in about 5 minutes which would let me show it to someone else, for example if I was a kid and wanted to show it to parents.  However, I'm like the master at the game so others won't be so quick.<br><br>I'm also thinking about the hook, but mainly I'm trying to say here's the gameplay, here's a beautiful preview of some more of it, also there's more in the game that you don't see but you get the idea.  If you like it then buy it quick.  The idea is to get a quick sale.  <br><br>The challenge demo I made broke that law.  A quick sale is the best sale.  Too many people would have a hard time and maybe keep it on their drive till they beat it but the quick sale is gone.  I want these things to convert ASAP. <br><br>The amount of content one needs to add into a demo is very subjective.  If you don't add enough you possibly don't hook the player.  If you add too much you possibly give them all they need.  I've played way too many demos that give me too much content/time and I get bored with it to soon.<br><br>I never registered my shareware copy of Doom!  The shareware itself contained hours of gameplay, it was a whole game in itself.  Sure the concept blew me away at the time but after the 8 levels in the game I was spent on the concept.<br><br>It would be cool to go back and see if the game would have done just as good or better on 1-3 levels.  Well, it's a bad argument anyway cause that was the best selling shareware ever ... doh!  But would it do as good in today's flooded shareware market, I think not ... Yeah!<br><br>I'm just experimenting.  Every game is different in how it will best sell.  I'm simply going to take baby steps with this one until I find the best approach.  For now I'm going to give the new demo some time and see how much better it converts, surely it can't do worse since I improved upon every rule of the shareware demo handbook aka Dexterity lol.<br><br>I might possibly do a more addict players to the gameplay demo with like half the levels and a 30 minute time limit or something.  It all depends.  I'd like to hit a 3 - 5% conversion rate.  With tweaking it's possible to up your conversion rate quite a bit.  You just have to figure out the correct light to show your title in.  First impressions are important.  In fact I think our next change will not likely be demo content but will be the GUI. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
