Sick kids, birthdays, other crazy family stuff ;)  anyway, in all that I managed to debug the particle system and get it out there.  A BIG THANK YOU to my alpha testers!<br><br><a href="http://sites.google.com/site/skullyproductions/Home/downloads/SamahSkully.zip" target="_blank">Here it is...</a> Its a simple demo created by an alpha tester (samah), and expanded by me into a micro-game.  It's just demonstrating the particle system... you shoot the mines, hitting one is big points, but so is pushing them off the top of the screen.  Don't let them past the bottom or you loose big! <b>Point and click!</b> P = screenshot.png<br><br><br>The system you see at work is a combination of particles that can behave like sprites, an Animation control system, a Timing System which includes sequencers, a graphics control system, a math module and I think thats it.<br><br>The documentation is coming along nicely.. I usually hit that for a while each time I get coders brain cramp and need something less challenging to do.<br><br>I'm debating what to hit next... <br><br>The Tile Engine has to be revisted because I'm converting the "actors" to extend particles with parenting.  It shouldn't take long.. all the other code for collisions etc is already there... just needs converting to the particle system methodology.  There were some timing system changes to account for as well which means some balancing... and the anim type changed to TMAnim which means a mass search-replace is in order. Lastly, I will want to add the ability to organize particles using the tiles as cells.. that provides the ability to add very efficient constraints between particle ID's... like verlets for example.  Anyway.. that jobs starting to sound big ;)<br><br>The HUD/GUI needs serious work... the base gadget and button is there and its cool, but I need to expand that now with all the other necessary gadgets for a typical game... sliders, proportionals, blah, blah.. The only reason I am writing my own is that I want one that can move around, rotate and stuff and not just sit in a box.  <a href="http://www.gregory-phoenix.com/" target="_blank">The Mysterious Past of Gregory Phoenix</a> was my inspiration for that.  If you know of a capable GUI I could legally wrap into TileMax with those capabilities let me know.<br><br>So..right now I'm debating whether to get the Tile System out or the GUI... decisions decisions! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's really strange these days.

It's as if it was quantized to integers and too slow to feel smooth. Therefore it's much rather a user choice than a problem with the engine, but at least I had to mention it. I think I'd have to play with it myself to really judge it properly. But then I'm a big fan of small filesizes and this tiny little demo already has nearly 2mb, but the content doesn't suggest to me it was justified. <br>I guess one of the perks of what you've done, however, is that it seems to be rather solid and fast for all the havok on the screen, haha.

I had a couple comments for sure but I'll put those in your thread<br><br>I'll double check that jitter feel your talking about.. that shouldn't be since everything is floating... but I did find one instance (SetAlpha) where I had accidentally put an int in the floats place.  I'll search just to make sure... but there shouldn't be any left.<br><br>Several people have commented about the file size, but you have to remember that this is not just a particle system.. there are a bunch of things at work in there that are used in other areas of TileMax as well.  The animation control system, the timing module, graphics module, media module, etc.. all the media for the samples is incbin'd as well... which is why you don't see any media files in the distribution.. so thats soundFX and png images.<br><br>Maybe I'll compile without the media and see what the file size is.. but considering that you can get a terabyte of storage for peanuts these days I'm not sure what the concern is.<br><br>I code for speed not file size.. to be honest, file size is "bottom of shoe" in terms of priority ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Nowadays it really ain't much trouble, even if downloading can at some point become a bitch. I personally just love the challenge of making small things appear large. If I was brave enough I probably would switch to a lower language to start doing 40k games or less, haha. So, yeah, I'm almost surprised it's not just me, but you are right. <br>Maybe, however, you should do a choice based media implementation, so only the required stuff goes into the file. I definitely hate extra assets outside of the main file, therefore I like incbin very much!<br><br>Thanks again for checking back into my SirPenta! :} <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

However, that was using particles with all sorts of sequencing going on behind the scenes which does add overhead.  I could create a raw benchmark for simple particles (onces that just use the core updates for deltaX,deltaY,  basically without sequencers (which I see others calling animators)<br><br>If you are wanting to benchmark the speed of this I could recompile it with the timing code removed.. I am currently clamping the particle updates to 60fps in the code itself.. not just by flip..  OO...  so even if vwait is disabled it will still only update at the specified frequency.<br><br>I'm also getting close to Beta with this, at that point I will open it up to anyone that wants to try the mod. I'm going to have a freeware/shareware/PD version that just has the quick splash screen you see in this demo (modified for the version of course) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
