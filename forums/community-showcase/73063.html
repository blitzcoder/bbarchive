I was able to actually play the game a it more without worrying as much about the robots. They were still a pain at times, but definately much more manageable. <br><br>I found 2 bugs :<br>1 - when you load the data disk into the projector it used to show a series of images that described the characteristics of the robots. Now the projector came on, but there was no image on the screen or the small television on the side of the projector.<br><br>2 - Enemy bots spawning on top of me, or spawning immediately within a room I just left. The door hadn't closed yet, I just went through it, saw a bot in the hall and backed up right into a newly spawned bot. I would suggest that new bots cannot spawn within a radius of the player. Very unrealistic when they spawn on top of you like that.<br><br>New suggestions :<br><br>Some items are interactable, but you don't know that unless you happen to click on them. This is both a challenge and a frustration. It is a challenge because in life we don't have highlight boxes on the things we do, but the frustration is that in a video game there is so much there that we cannot interact with that important things can become overlooked, especially if important interactive items look like the other common "window dressing" we find in the rest of the game. <br><br>One example of this is when you solve the timer in the Delta section. What you do next isn't quite obvious. Definitely a surprising trap, but I actually reloaded several times to try and see if I missed something before I stumbled upon setting the trap of (don't want to get any more detailed and ruin someone elses play). It just wasn't obvious what to do next. <br><br>The hidden air vent at least had some kind of indicator on the map it was there, but it actually required a hint from you before I found that. Maybe once a specific part of the game has been accomplished a highlighter could appear on those things if they are crucial to advance. With the hidden vent it would have an indicator box show up only after the map was found. In the delta room the an indicator would have saved me 10 minutes of clicking on all the obvous stuff over and over.<br><br>The broken fuse at the very beginning is another example.<br><br>Without indicators it reminds me of playing the very first Doom game. To find those secret rooms you had to face the wall and keep hitting the action button to open the door. This not only got very boring to have to check every niche, wall, painting, plant, etc to find the important stuff, it also forced the player to turn their back to potential surprise attacks.<br><br>Other than these minor quibbles I still found that your project was done very well. The graphics were superb and the play was fun. I think that if you can provide multiple solutions to the same problem then that would increase the range of playability so that players who do not think alike are not stumped so often. A crowbar to break that first lock, a message hinting at hidden air vents, unused computers that provide hint messages to those that care to stand around and look at them, etc.<br><br>Great job, and thanks a bunch for listening to us! I think that you have vastly improved the play over what your initial release provided! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So far, so good. <br><br>But the game is still throwing way too many robots at random at me, and one even spawned right behind me. And they still cause too much damage.<br><br>If I had the chance, I would save the game after each step that I made.<br><br>I think this random spawing is still the biggest issue with the game. I'd pretty much prefer a fixed set of robots on each level. Position them at strategically important points that they defend. Make them tough, if you want to, but once they're destroyed, don't spawn new robots. Spawning is unlogical and I find it very annoying. Enemies have to enter the stage through a logical entrance point, like an elevetar or something, and only then it's ok if a second or third wave arrives.<br><br>Ciao, <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
