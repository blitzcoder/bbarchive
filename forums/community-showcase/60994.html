Unfortunately, like so many other hobby coders, I didn't finish many.<br><br>But some of them are finished enough to be played. You can download them on my website <a href="http://www.mrkeks.net/?show=produzieren" target="_blank">http://www.mrkeks.net/?show=produzieren</a> . I'm sorry, but neither the page nor the games are in English. It's all German. Maybe some of you know some words German, so they can understand, what the games are about and what they should do.<br><br>For these who don't understand German, a short list of the games you can play without understanding German:<br><br>Aliens Exist: It's a little egoshooter. As in every proper shooter, there's almost no text ;). (Don't be confused when you get plenty of health and ammo all of a sudden... I haven't removed the developer cheats, as the development is still in progress and the 0.4.0 version was just a compile'n'zip'n'upload action :)) <a href="http://www.mrkeks.net/?show=artikel59" target="_blank">http://www.mrkeks.net/?show=artikel59</a><br><br>BlitzSnowCraft: You take part in a weird snowball fight.. The game isn't that complete. Though, I know some people, who really enjoy playing it. <a href="http://www.mrkeks.net/?show=artikel58" target="_blank">http://www.mrkeks.net/?show=artikel58</a><br><br>DGX: A spaceshooter... Of course you don't have to understand the story briefings and the chat between the wing men. You usually only have to kill as many enemies as you can. But there's one mission in which you're flying a cloaked ship.. In this mission you are not to kill any enemies! But better try to avoid the suicide enemies! You won't be able to take much damage in this mission! <a href="http://www.mrkeks.net/?show=artikel57" target="_blank">http://www.mrkeks.net/?show=artikel57</a><br><br>WollKnäuelWar: An artillery battle... You don't need to understand the few texts.. But you need a second player. ;) <a href="http://www.mrkeks.net/?show=artikel56" target="_blank">http://www.mrkeks.net/?show=artikel56</a><br><br>Kaobomber2: Muaha, this game is really dumb =). Therefore it doesn't need language. ... I think it doesn't need to be played either - coded and uploaded it just4fun.. If you don't dislike kaos, you'll dislike this game!.. <a href="http://www.mrkeks.net/?show=artikel55" target="_blank">http://www.mrkeks.net/?show=artikel55</a><br><br><br>Thanks for playing! (I'm one of these strange guys who need people playing their games to please their ego ;))<br><br>..I hope it isn't that obvious from my text that English isn't my mother tongue. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I took it as a compliment, but somehow I associate it also with parents putting things into top shelfs in order to keep them away from their children. What exactly do English speaking people mean when talking of top shelfs? :D <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I was the lead coder but many of the cool things aren't by me. Most of the levels, meshs and menus were made by other people. So e.g. our 'theme music' wasn't chosen by me... My co-coder INpac placed the theme in the splash screen. I think it was meant to be a joke. It isn't licensed, but as it is just a joke made by hobby coders in a freeware game, we don't exspect trouble.<br><br>I'd like to credit the Aliens Exist team:<br><br>INpac for the cool menus and the intro. Moreover he created the biggest part of editor and some other minor code passages.<br><br>Vincent: He made the first to levels and some other graphics. He was also responsible for textures..<br><br>Ava: She made some very useful models.<br><br>BrightDevil: The third level is by him.<br><br>MoeRon also made some meshs.<br><br><br>@"top shelf": I somehow would have guessed that top shelf means something like that :D <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
