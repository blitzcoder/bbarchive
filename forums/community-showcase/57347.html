</pre><br><br><br>Notice anything special?<br><br>Parenting!  And it works as better than the parent/child system in Blitz 3D!<br><br>Now, when you hide a parent, the children are hidden as well.  But their state is maintained, so when you make the parent visible again the children that were visible reappear, and those that weren't, don't.<br><br>Alpha is tied to the parent as well.  Fade out a parent, and the children fade with it.  It will even handle cases where a child is at 50% alpha, and you can even set up a case where the parent is 50% transparent and the child is not, because you can set the alpha for the child to 200%.<br><br>Just as in Blitz 3D when you parent a child, and move that child, you move it in parent space.  When you scale the parent up, the child scales up, and the position of the child moves to maintain it's position in the now scaled parent space.  Rotation works as well.<br><br>Each function for getting a sprite's position, scale, alpha, etc, has a global parameter.  Set it to false, and you get the sprite's local state, relative to any parent it has.  Set it to True, and you get it's global state, or where it actually is, and how it actually looks on the screen.  This is all handled through recursion.<br><br>Here's a list of all the methods so far:<br><br><pre class=code>

</pre><br><br><br>Why do you want parenting in a sprite system?  Well, there's a lot of reasons, but one of the best examples would be where you have a menu.  The menu background could be the parent of all the buttons and things inside it.  When you want to move the whole thing on or off the screen, you need only animate the parent and all the children will follow along with it.<br><br>Anyway, getting all that parenting stuff working was a huge pain.  There's a lot of rotation math involved and it's hard to wrap your head around how to invert the transformations so you can parent/unparent a sprite without changing the sprite's position on the screen.  Especially at 4am. :-)  So that's what I'm most happy with here, and what I'm testing now to make sure it all works right. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Take my Lego game for example.  At MOST, there were like 100 sprites on the screen at once.

I don't really see the point in that.  In the Lego game I coded using my AniBOB system, I don't think I ever used the same animation sequence twice in the code.<br><br>So the current plan is to simply have you specify what you want played, when you want it played.<br><br>To give you an idea what the anibob system could do, and what the new system will be able to do...<br><br>For each sprite:<br><br>You can tell it to play a set of frames.  <br><br>You can tell it how long you want the animation to take.<br><br>You can tell it how long you want it to delay before playing the animation.  This means you can chain animations.  Ie, specify a bunch of animations at once, and let them run in order.<br><br>You can tell it what image to switch to when it starts playing the animation.  Again, so you can chain animations.<br><br>Each animation has a type.  Frame, position, scale, rotation, color, alpha.  And using these types, you can query the system about whether the sprite is playing any kind of animation, (or has one queued) or whether a specific type of animation is playing.  So you can make a sprite's frames loop, and have a one shot animation of it moving from place to place, and find out when the one shot has completed, so you can stop animation on it and free it.<br><br>Speaking of looping and one shot, you can play animations forwards or backwards, and one shot, looping, ping-pong, or one shot ping pong.  You can also play them with linear time, or various sine-wave based times, to make the animation speed up, or slow down, or speed up then slow down.<br><br><br>"assuming the src will be public?"<br><br>It's not going to be free, but like all my other systems, you will get the source with it, so you can modify it however you like. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
