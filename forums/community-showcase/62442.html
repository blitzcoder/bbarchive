In hindsight I might have spent more time researching exists physics libraries and modules but all my work is time limited.  As it stands the physics are very basic and work enough to keep the game fun without the flaws getting in the way too much.  I might be wrong of course...<br><br>@Warpy:<br>Thanks very much!  The friction has been kept fairly high to ensure that the player retains some semblance of control.  Some of the unlockable ships do have lower friction and less mass though.<br><br>I'll give your ship control idea a go but I'm already thinking that backing into a corner is fairly cowardly behaviour and <i>deserves</i> punishing with crazy madness!<br><br>@RAM:<br>Whilst I can't deny that looks wise Geometry Wars has had an influence, gameplay wise Fluffoidz isn't even close - it's more like an inverted Asteroids.

There's also one about the physics of billiards which was quite useful.<br><br>I've added quite a bit of fudge though to get it to work as a "one hit" collision in a multi-collision environment.  The SkipMovement flag, which literally causes no velocity to be applied during the sprite's Update() method call, basically means that if an object is involved in more than one collision it won't go anywhere until those multiple collisions have been resolved and one of the objects can escape fom that collision.  There's also a fudge that causes a trapped object to change direction by one degree each cycle to try and force it's way out of a trapping collision.<br><br>Have fun! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Originally, I only had one score table that you HAD to register for.  After a while I began to feel that this was off-putting, uninviting and a bit unfair; so I've recently implemented the unregistered users table.  The "upsell" for registering is that you can store a high score for each of the ships you've unlocked.  Not sure that's much of an upsell really...it's funny how these things sometimes sound like a good idea in your head and then when they're out in the wild they seem a bit, well, underwhelming...<br><br>Anyway, with respect to the slow down issues; cheers for the info.

Unfortunately the score either wasn't submitted or didn't make it to the server.  I've made some alterations to the score submission process - hopefully that will have fixed the issue.

What I was doing was that in a variety of places, including my much used TSprite type, I was saving the current alpha, blend, color, rotation and scale, setting all the above for the correct instance being drawn and then restoring all the above to their saved values.  The upshot being that I could just be basically lazy elsewhere, set the values that I needed and draw whatever I wanted.  This however meant I was making many, many basically redundant calls.<br><br>What I've done now is everytime I make a change to the current alpha, blend, color, rotation and scale I save the value as a field in my TPlayArea type.  This allows me to compare any changes I might do to the current value (thus saving many "Get.." calls) and only change them if the new value is different to the current (thus saving many "Set..." calls).<br><br>I still think I've got too many particles - I've asked about this in another thread though here:<br><br><a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=62943" target="_blank">http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=62943</a><br><br>The new version is in the usual place:<br><br><a href="http://www.buzzardgames.com/feedback/fluffoidz.exe" target="_blank">http://www.buzzardgames.com/feedback/fluffoidz.exe</a> (4.5Mb)<br><br>I've also used UPX to compact the exe - I'm impressed by the 1.5Mb it's lopped off the size. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
