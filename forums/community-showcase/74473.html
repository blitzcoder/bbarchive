Woah and then it just exited.  So I only played one level and it chucked me out.  Probably best to let them try several times and only show that screen when they properly exit after playing.  OK tried again, and this time chose relaxed but after a short time it came up with the same screen.  To have to keep loading the game up just to try it our for a decent amount of time is annoying.<br>- Your tiles are nice and colourful and different but really you're going to need some kind of theme to sell this.<br>- I paused when +1500 was on screen and it appeared over the Resume/Exit menu instead of under it.<br>- The mouse over for the magnifying glass is not it the right place.<br>- What about some kind of penalty for clicking less than 3 to stop random clickers?<br>- When I clicked the rocket (which has a funny mouse over area too) my mouse cursor was sliding left!<br>- I filled the bar up and was then clicking on more shapes but nothing was happening.<br>- It would be much more fun and fast if you could click on groups rapidly one after the other without waiting for the new shapes to fall in.
