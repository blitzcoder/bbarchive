You might better slidly adjust backgrounds (the "panels") if you want to split information into parts. That way you could use "calm" colors for the texts so it does not look that "over-excited".<br><br>There are plenty of possibilities to make it look "sleek" - and of course with creating some reuseable assets (or basic assets to advance from when creating theme specific assets).<br><br><br>Eg. the Images on the top left ("portraits") just look "copy pasted in". Put them in portrait-frames might improve situation - as the frame "unifies" the differences.<br><br>I understand that a single developer gets used to its own food but let it taste others and you might get feedback how to spice it up.<br><br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Heres a tip/thought for you<br>if you didn't know your game - would you have any idea of what it was or how to play it?<br><br>If you can truly answer no - then there is something wrong with the presentation.<br><br>And no - having a black opening screen with 'how to play' is just wrong too. as this says. "this far too complex to be obvious" (people never read instructions - they really just want to get straight into it)<br><br>think about a simple text adventure:<br><br>you are on a windy road<br>exits are N,S,E<br>What do you want do do?&lt;input&gt;<br><br>it's told you where you are and what you can do and now want you to do something. all text and all obvious.<br><br>You could have it as a graphic with NSEW buttons, but how would the user know what to press - see where I'm going here?<br><br>Keyboard controls are another thing. if they aren't signposted (Press U to unlike or press the unlike button), most people will never know that pressing U is the same as pressing the Unlike button. And saying "you could have read the instructions is really saying "I don't care if you couldn't be bothered to find out how this thing works"<br><br>Taking something from just working to being user friendly is a very big step. and in some cases it needs to be the first thing not the last thing.<br><br>As I said. Your ideas and concepts are brilliant - possibly some of the best I've seen. but your implementation of them feels hurried and a bit sloppy.
