I can say that this has certainly sold good numbers in the first few days.  Not as many as PC but *definitely* enough to justify making a Mac version. I'll be watching the sales figures over the first month to compare them with the PC ones to see what sort of % they are of total sales.  Possibly some Mac sales are lost to people who own a PC and a Mac who already bought it on PC, but I doubt that's very many people in reality.  Also I'll be interested to find out if the Mac conversion rate is any higher.  The PC conversion rate was very good anyway.<br><br>BFG didn't want to do a Linux version btw, as they don't sell Linux games on their site.  Perhaps that will change in the future, who knows?  One thing I've recently finished is localised versions in German, French and Spanish.  Apparently these always convert well as people prefer to play the games in their native language of course and BFG have a big German and French site with a Spanish one starting soon.  I certainly advise anyone writing a game to have all the text in a separate file so that it can be localised easily, plus you should leave enough space for the text on buttons and other HUD items for longer words in other languages (especially German). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Naturally there's mine ;-) Then there's Azada which is a very popular selection of mini-"room escape" puzzles and mini-games.  Madame Fate and Ravenhearst are very good hidden object games.  I played Sparkles yesterday and it was well made and addictive. Chocolatier 2 is some kind of strategy/sim which is well respected but I've not got round to playing it yet.  I think Tradewind legends is another strategy/sim.  Apart from that pet game at no.10 the other two are hidden objects games which people either love or hate I guess (I quite enjoy playing the good ones with my family).  There's that's the low down.<br><br>Depending on how you make an in-depth game it could do really well (like Fairy Godmother - great game, and like Chocolatier) or not if it's aimed at techie types who never buy games anyway unless you hit some kind of big time Indie award or something I guess (like Aquaria)... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The game mouse was where it should be, but I could click on anything with it, because the real mouse was hidden and way below the game mouse cursor. To fix it I had to try multiple times to click on options then try and get it back on full screen. After swtching it to full screen, it worked, and when I switched it to window again, it worked.

I used up the demo and had loads of fun every second I used it. Second, yes that's what happened except that it was invisible until I clicked somewhere where the OS cursor would be off the window, then the game would pause, the OS cursor would appear, and the active app would be finder. If I moved over a button with the game cursor, the button would light up but when I clicked on it I would find out that the cursor is actually lower, which is how I found the bug. To get to options to turn back on full screen, I had to find the button with the invisible OS cursor, and click really fast because when I moved over the button with the OS cursor it was only active for a short second before I'd have to move the mouse again and click fast to click on the button. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Once or twice in development I saw something similar but couldn't reliably duplicate it.
