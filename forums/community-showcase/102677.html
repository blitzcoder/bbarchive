I am curious about the procedural building of the levels.<br><br>To answer your survey :<br>A. I say 3/10 because all the meshes do not seem to use the same graphic style (some meshes and textures seems to have more details than others). I think that you don't need to have highly detailed realistic meshes and textures  to make a good game but it is important to use the same graphics style for all meshes/textures or it can break the atmosphere.<br>B. 5/10 why not !<br>C. For me it depends on the subject/gameplay/possibilities so if it is fun and it makes me laugh (which seems to be your positioning) and the price is not too high, why not.<br>D. You only can answer this. Without a demo it is hard to evaluate the game.<br>E. A video describing the subject, the gameplay, the possibilities, and showing the ambiance (and humor) is better than static text and static images IMO<br>F. Unify the graphics style.<br>G.

It's the opportunity cost.  What are we bringing to the table that's new and interesting and compelling enough for a player to spend his time on it?<br><br>If it's a 3rd person platformer, what exactly is the hook?  Why this and not some other third person platformer, or another game style entirely?<br><br>A. How good or bad are the gfx(1-10)?  -9001<br>B.

What would be a reasonable price (Also including<br>free gfx/gameplay expansion packs in the future)?  I would not pay any amount of money for this.  At this point I would have to be the one getting paid in order to get me to play it.<br>E. Are the concepts clear?  Yes<br>F. What would you change about it?  The graphics<br>G. WHat would you change about the style/presentation?  Gouraud shaded polygons are not looking good in 2014<br><br>I think you are biting off much more than you can chew in the art department and it's not just the graphics engine.  Some of the heads you have made that are on display on your site are pretty good looking but I think the body style is a non-starter.<br><br>If you expect people to play this, much less pay money for it, the graphics are going to have to be completely overhauled from models to color scheme to everything.  I suggest that you look at a different style of model entirely-- look into voxel graphics, basically models built up out of cubes.  Even if the engine is not really a voxel engine but just appears to be, graphics in that style are clean and clear and look good even though they are simple (see Cubeworld and Voxatron.)  That graphical style is much more friendly to graphics done by programmers and not artists.  Look at the graphics below-- they are totally rudimentary but the style and color scheme, bright saturated colors, are appealing and eye catching.  I would say the worst thing about the images above is the color scheme and second is the modeling.<br><br>Pseudovoxel graphics will be a ton easier and it will look better.  Also Blitz3D is more than capable of producing good-looking voxel or pseudovoxel graphics.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdRri5jSMs" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdRri5jSMs</a>  &lt;&lt; I don't know what language Voxatron was written in but Blitz3D could do it easily.  <br><br>Then you have the much more difficult to answer questions regarding gameplay and WHY someone would spend time playing it.  Are the puzzles really compelling enough that someone is going to spend time on it?  Combat is a very easy way out, that's why there's combat in almost every game out there, it's an easy and straightforward mechanic.<br><br>But that's all a secondary concern-- you have to make radical changes to the graphics style or nobody is going to play it and you will have wasted a huge amount of effort. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It sounds like a fun game and the graphics are good, as well.<br><br><br>You have to carefully consider feedback you will get.  The Blitz community has a crab mentality.  If you have ever had a crab in a bucket, he will often be able to climb out.  If you have several crabs in a bucket, as soon as one crab tries to climb out, the other crabs will grab him and pull him back in.  It is kinda like that in the Blitz community.  The biggest thing you will get knocked for is your artwork.  There seems to be a concerted effort by people in the community that give the same feedback for every game somebody posts and they complain about the artwork and want the artwork to look like the quality of artwork in other games.  Of course when the game designer makes the changes, the new slam on his work is there is now nothing unique about his game and it looks like every other game out there.  So always stay true to yourself and your goals for this game.  Make the game YOU want to make!<br><br>I like it and I look forward to it being completed.  Major kudos to you for having some originality and talent and not making a match three, RPG, FPS, Solitaire, Hidden Object or any of the other games that get done to death.<br><br>And the image up above in your post (not the images I posted)?  The bottom right screen, where they are on the island with the trees?  That green used for the ground there would look much better in place of the green I complained about earlier.  Also in that pic of them on the island, the waterfall there is an AWESOME touch! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
