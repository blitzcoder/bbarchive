It's based on a game I developed on the Amiga in about 93, and is still a work in progress.  However, before I polish it up and offer up an alpha version for testing on sites like 'Indiegamer' and 'GameDev', I'd like to see what my good friends, the Blitz community think of it.<br><br>Gameplay<br>======<br><br>A combination of Mario Bros and Bubble Bobble, to put it in simple terms.<br><br>It's a single-screen platformer where you use your ice gun to freeze the enemies, then jump on their heads.<br><br>Jump on multiple heads to get combos - this can sometimes open secret doors to bonus rooms filled with lovely fruit!  In this demo it is one player, although it is very much designed as a two player competition to collect the best bonuses.<br><br>There is a boss at the end of each world (8 in total).  The demo includes one world only.<br><br>Controls:<br><br>[UP ARROW / Joystick button 1]              - Jump<br>[CTRL / SPACE / Joypad Button 2]           - Shoot Ice Ball<br>[LEFT + RIGHT ARROW / Joypad D-Pad]  - Move left / right<br><br>Feedback<br>======<br><br>First of all I'd like to know if there's any technical issues.  The game runs in 1024x768 at 60Hz.  I also haven't tested the joypad input, so if there's a problem let me know!<br><br>Second, and more importantly, I'd like to know what you think of the 'feel' of the game, the way the character responds, the difficulty of the levels, are the graphics up to par for an indie title?  Could it sell?<br><br>Let me know fellow Blitz developers with access to an Intel Mac!<br><br><br><br>(Windows version includes a keyboard-only .exe for thos having trouble with the character running left!  Temporary fix until I buy a gamepad.) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Try adding a 1 pixel border round the image, this means the gfx card can anti-alias the edge better.<br>- It would be nice if you can go off the sides, like Bon Bon Quest: <a href="http://www.binaryjoy.co.uk/games/review/bonbon-quest/" target="_blank">http://www.binaryjoy.co.uk/games/review/bonbon-quest/</a> You allow going off the bottom so it seems weird not to go off the sides.<br>- When the music looped back to the start it made a horrible spectrum type loading noise for 0.5 seconds before starting agian.<br>- Death anim needs a noise and perhaps more going on (this is probably on your to do list already ;-)<br>- Died on level 6 I think (The castle)<br><br>btw, I'd like to put this on my site when it's done if you are agreeable to an affiliate program? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I ask because if you are selling it yourself you won't need to add as much "pro-game" stuff to it, but bearing in mind that's what people expect these days you might as well....<br><br>Glad to see you've made the clouds smooth, added a death noise and other things.  The new musical stun items are cool as are the extra weapons, certainly adds variety.<br><br>OK here's my list, it's not exhaustive and may contain dupes from other people:<br><br>1) Are your music and sounds effects original (made by you) or royalty free for *commercial* use?<br>2) Change the name for commercial release on portals maybe?  Something like Little Robots Adventure or something (you know the kind of thing I mean).<br>3) you need a lives icon next to x10 such as a little robot.<br>4) It would be nice to save and load games or resume from where you left off.<br>5) You probably need a plot screen and a map screen (at the very least)<br>6) Icon for the current weapon?  Way to swap weapons?<br>7) in-game Tutorial is required and so is an instructions screen.<br>8) Chest is cool, needs a noise when it opens and throws out stuff<br>9) Need an options screen on the title page (and via the in-game menu) it should include volumes and also a windowed mode.  I know windowed mode won't be as smooth (cos you have set the game to run at 60Hz) but the portals will require it.<br>10) have you tested it on cards with VSync turned (forced) off? Does it run at the same speed?<br>11) Exe Icon<br>12) Man still runs off to the left when my joystick is plugged in, shame :-(<br>13) Escape in-game should show an in-game menu with one of the options being quit.<br>14) Game over screen appears for a fixed time so button pressing doesn't do anything (makes you think it's stuck until it disappears), it should stay there until a button is pressed.<br>15) Mouse should be usable on tht etitle page to click menu items<br>16) Menu items can only be clicked with Ctrl (why?) and , .  Really you should allow Space and Enter.<br>17) How about default shoot and jump keys are Z and X? Because , and . make me hunch up funny as I am forced to sit non-centred at my keybaord.  Or Ctrl + Shift but you may run into trouble with StickyKeys etc...<br>18) redfine keys options for sure.<br>19) Still think if you can go off top and bottom you should be able to go off the sides too ;-)<br>20) Oh dear, the game crashed on me on level 4 (I think) I was using the lightening on some robots on the right hand side of the screen and the screen went black with the music still playing then it crashed to the desktop after about 2 secs.<br><br>I expect that you've already got some of those things in your list.<br><br>When you've got all the extra stuff done like menus, map/options screens, tutorial etc then it's ready for beta release.  This stuff normally takes quite a while!  You think you've finished a game then you have to do tons or boring menu stuff to make it ready for commercial release.

This was just a working title, taken from my Amiga version of the game when I was 17.<br>3) Lives icon - def.<br>4) I am still thinking about restart points. I know it's a big issue, but part of the thing I loved about for example Bubble Bobble, even Jet Set Willy, was that you had to work hard to get to later levels.  Perhaps it would be possible to save with your lives saved too, so that it's just like an extended pause.  But that also makes it easy to repeat until complete...  Really unsure about this tbh.  I want the game to have some longevity...  Anyone else have any thoughts on this?<br>5) Map and plot screens in the works.<br>6) Icon for current weapon for sure.  Still toying with weapon ideas.  At the mo, ice is your main one, and the others are powerups, however they all are pretty balanced, and I was thinking of adding, say, fire blocks you can put out with ice, ice blocks you melt with fire etc to open secret areas.  For this it would be nice to change between weapons.  In this case it might be nice to have ammo for each, so that you have to learn where to save your fire ammo for the big bonuses locked behind ice doors etc...  I'm really open to any ideas about this... Anyone?<br>7) Tutorial for sure, not sure whether to integrate it into the title screens as a sort of demo, or to do it ingame.  Thoughts?<br>8) Chest noise yes.  Need to redraw chest too, looks cheap.<br>9) Options for volume + windowed mode for sure, still haven't looked into the Hz issue, but it seems to perform the same in Windows and OSX, no faster or slower.<br>10) With vsync off the graphics tear quite nastily, so not sure about that.<br>11) Icon goes without saying!<br>12) Ah the joystick bug's crept back in cos I never actually removed it when I switched back over to Mac for development.  I just cut it out of the 0-14 PC build.  Ooops.  Must buy joypad.<br>13) Agreed about Escape to quit.<br>14) Again, agreed.<br>15) Mouse will be usable on the title screens for sure.<br>16) Menu items will be tidied up a lot.<br>17)  The keys are set this way to accommodate two players on one keyboard, Shift and Control is another option, but there's no Right Contol on for example Mac laptops.  What are the standards for two players on keyboard?<br>18) Redef keys high on the list.<br>19) Hmm that old chestnut.  Looking at the maps I've done so far it wouldn't really hurt, on the next stage I do I'll try it out and see how it feels.  I wasn't sure about it in Superstar Chefs and Bonbon Quest tbh.<br>20) Yep there's def a crash in there somewhere with one of the new powerups, hasn't happened too often, a combination of factors I think, I will track it down next time it happens.<br><br>As for beta release, I wouldn't even call this an alpha yet, not until I've got all the gameplay I intended into it (eg level timers, a few more bonus types that you get for completing the collections that appear that give you one of the bonus effects for, say, two levels permanently , a boss secret exit, which is what the gems are for, much like Rainbow Island) and I was wondering if I should wait for that before uploading it to Indiegamer?  Long sentence I know, sorry!<br><br>I'm still entertaining your framework, but also thinking about just sticking to 1024 * 768 for the game (although it works happily in any res) cos I don't think it will limit the potential customers too much.  Who really has an 800*600 display these days?<br><br>Anyway, thanks again man, be glad to do the same for you.  You got anything up your sleeve?<br><br>Jasper <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Thing is that casual games (which include some very good "cute" platformers) never punish the player by making them restart etc so being able to carry on from any of the levels would be essential imho.<br>6) It's cool you've added more weapons but it starts to make the game non-"simple" which is again what the portals would want to sell it (up to you if you want to use portals but you *will* make a *lot* more money).  If you add in ammo and other perceived "complex" weapon factors then it may put off some players like little kids.  Btw, level 1 is too hard for my 5 year old son, the platforms need just slightly too perfect jumping to get to the top so if you could ease the player in with a really simple level or jumps which require less accuracy, that would be cool.<br>7) Instructions screen is always useful and an in-game tutorial as well is the norm.<br>10) I wasn't suggesting using VSync off permanently, I was just saying test it to check that the game runs the same speed and not super-fast.<br>17) Ah yes I see. Here's the thing though, is one of your *main* marketing points going to be that it's a two player game?  If not and you expect that 95%+ of your players will be playin gon their own, the keys should be made easier and more normal for them.  Perhaps when two player mode is selected a different key set could be used?  I'm not sure how other games do this, worth some research?<br><br>I wasn't trying to sell you my framework ;-) With how far you've got you might as well finish it otherwise integrating with my framework now may prove a bit longwinded...<br><br>As for me, yeah the framework is being converted to Mac this month, then I'm making a game for 2-3 months for a very well known big portal.

In a way, you don't really need to understand the weapon/powerup system as it is, you just pick em up and sometimes become more powerful or your weapon changes... although it is quite deep, and experienced gamers can potentially have a lot of fun trying to max out your score by combinations using combos, things like flying where you can do an unlimited combo if you know how (until your wings run out), and getting fast level times to open the bonus rooms and chests.  Also trying to always do at least x2 combo will get you more gems, if you get all the colours of the rainbow it opens a 'super bonus room' which contains a huge item, million pointer or whatever.  So I quite like the weapon system as is, with ice as your main, and the others as little fun ones to vary the gameplay without you having to think about it too much (ie change weapons).  Hopefully this doesn't make it too complicated. One thing I should perhaps do is make the 'alt' weapons more powerful than the ice one, rather than balanced with it...<br><br>On top of this, two-player is a big factor, as anyone who's played Bubble Bobble will attest - it's all about grabbing those big bonuses before your friend who becomes increasingly riled - adding a whole new slant to the game.  This was one of the things I really felt made this kind of one-screen platformer special, hence the huge emphasis on collectables.  I will def. look into similar games approach to the controls though.<br><br>On a tech note, I think the game does run faster with no vsync, quite a lot in fact, is that a problem? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's pretty interesting. I played it on a PC and it was, I think, running at 30fps, then played it on the Mac and it was 60fps. Everything was a lot faster, all objects moved around quickly, and the timer seemed to be counting down faster than one count per second. I don't know what your target fps rate is, I presume its 60fps? Thing is, it doesn't always run that fast and when it doesn't that really changes the gameplay, which is why people use delta timing and the like. At 30fps the fruits that are revealed when you jump on an enemy take much longer to settle before you can actually collect there, whereas at 60fps you seem to have the timing about right. Also the player movement is very sluggish feeling at 30fps. It's a pretty good game, but in some ways I also felt it was a bit `safe`, and not really anything new. Indeed what I saw so far did not really seem original at all? I don't mean to be harsh, it's actually pretty nice to see a platform game written in BlitzMax running on a Mac, but I didn't find it very original. I think it would definitely be a good idea to put in delta timing or similar for when the framerate is lower, unless of course you're aiming at a specific hardware requirement. It looks nice overall, but I think it needs something extra special. (really nice smoke and lightning effects, though!) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
