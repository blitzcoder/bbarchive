I'm looking for beta testers to test this game and tell me how good it is!<br>hack3r is an arcady action game. You control your avatar (cube) and shoot at the incoming bots (cones) for as long as you can hold out. The game has several different enemy types, ranging from standard bots that try to ram you to advanced bots that shoot back! To help defend yourself, grab the power ups that randomly appear for bonuses, ranging from invincibility, increased shooting power, to homing bullets and speed boosts!<br>The zipped game, along with all necessary files, is available free for download at <a href="http://www.sharebig.com/share.php?id=s10bmqknlfj9HAhyO" target="_blank"> this link! </a><br>It is a demo only, and stops working after 10 games. Of course if I update it, more demos will be posted with reset timers.<br>Please post here with comments, reviews, bugs, ideas, and anything else you can think of to help improve this game!<br>You'll need this password I (accidentally) assigned to it:<br><b>firstupload73</b><br>Thanks! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
