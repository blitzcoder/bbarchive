I have a long view distance and to avoid polygon tearing, I have to set screen depth to 32bit and the card slows down for that. I wouldn't be surprised with a card upgrade I'd get a big boost in speed and could lower my minimum spec accordingly.<br><br>The other thing the screens don't really show is that the level contains about 80 computer controlled actors (tankbases/turrets + bullets and explosions) and there's a lot of AI/pathfinding going on in the background. I've been pretty stringent in not 'cheating' with the AI and that adds to the loads.. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Of course, if the enemy tanks just know where you are without seeing you and actually *act* on this knowledge, that would be bad cheating. Often much (quadratic) time is lost with every object checking the location of every other object, but again often it is enough to have the enemies check only the location of the human player (however, to have team-play they would have to do more). And a shortcut I used in some experiments (otherwise known as unfinished games) is to check which objects could be spotted by the player (potentially), and to mark these objects right away as being able to spot the player (if they were to look in a certain direction). Well this is probably not relevant to your game, the AI you are talking about may already be a bit more complex!<br><br>edit; indeed, your game looks like it has teams fighting each other, so just taking care of "the" human player will not work, in that case... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I don't want the player to be the 'centre of the world' in that there can be events going on that are completely separate to the player.<br><br>However, there is a fair amount of cross checking going on - in fact too much and come to think of it, a not inconsiderable amount of duplication. Need to look at perhaps keeping some sort of visibility check table. The other possibility is doing some terrain height preprocessing to create a height table (which includes walls), and use that for coarse entity visibility checking (I don't have any arches or covered areas in the game).<br><br>Finally, can someone give me an idea of upgrading options. I have a P3 660mhz, Matrox G400 32mb, 128mb mem, running windows 95 (yes, W95). If I were to keep the CPU but swap out the vid card for say, a geforce 3 and upgrade the op to w98, what kind of an fps increase might I expect? Small, big, medium? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This is a BIG advantage, even for Blitz3D apps which is only DX7. And upgrade to W2000PRO if you want to upgrade the OS - but anything is better than W95! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
