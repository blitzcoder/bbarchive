Music is NOT something you do for a target audience.  Music, like all forms of art, is an "expression" and is something that should be shared, but not critiqued.  Music is an art form and something you do because you love the "art" itself.  What others think of it doesn't matter.  Critiquing music is just as big of a waste of time as critiquing poety or classic literature.  Trying to second guess what the artist "means" accomplishes nothing.  Its a shame people cannot learn to appreciate all forms of art for what they are.  Unfortunately the world is filled with a lot of untalented, jealous people who exist simply to criticize the hard work of others when they see them achieving things they cannot.  Criticizing the art of others is the only way these folks can feel good about themselves.  <br><br>Example:  Earlier this week I wrote and released a song I wrote for my daughter Sariah Renae who died in '98 and has been on my mind a lot more than usual.  So far I have only shared it with close friends on an email group of writers.  Although I have received a lot of positive comments and I appreciate them, the opinions really mean nothing to me.  I like the song and it conveys what I intend it to, and I simply was sharing a part of myself with some friends.  I could care less if others like it or not.  As long as I like it is all that matters. ;c) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
