Also, all entities are rendered, even if they are outside of the camera view: this makes updating easier (in minib3d/openb3d, every command that affects an entity must act recursively on all its children; in bogl that's not needed, since a simple glPushMatrix does the trick), but the rendering might be slower, because you have to render entities that does not need to be rendered (and you can't avoid to do that, because they might have children that need to be rendered, even if the parent doesn't)<br><br>The way you used stencils is similar to what I used in openb3d... we worked in a different way, but we come to a similar solution.<br><br>I liked your idea of event-based control... looks really simple and intuitive.

(Looks like I forgot the EntityAlpha 0 optimization... I'll add that next time I'm near the machine.)<br><br>bOGL actually does maintain independent global transform information for each entity - it doesn't stack glPushMatrix calls (I'm not sure that even works for an arbitrarily-large hierarchy - isn't it limited to about eight or something?). I think the main difference from miniB3D is that it waits to update child entities' global transform until something actually wants that information, so that if you put e.g. three separate movement calls to the same entity in quick succession, you don't end up actually traversing the child tree three times. (Having a "isGlobalPositionValid" flag and updating only when queried-and-false has been heavily criticized as "typical C++ bull****" in other engines though, so this may have been a bad idea.)<br><br><br>The event-based control is indeed an awesome idea. I don't deserve any credit for it though! You should take a look at <a href="http://brenwill.com/cocos3d/" target="_blank">cocos3D</a> and their CCAction class, which is the original, and copy them! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

On Windows (the home, for now, of BlitzPlus), that ABI is limited to OpenGL 1.1. Language limitations of BlitzPlus make working with function pointers near-impossible, which in turn means the dynamic function loading required to use OpenGL versions beyond 1.1 is rather difficult, in a way that you wouldn't experience in BlitzMax or C++ (where language-level support for function pointers makes this completely transparent to the user). This isn't specific to GLSL, it applies to the entire OpenGL API above version 1.1.<br><br>I can think of workarounds, but I can't think of one that would be suitably fast without needing to use at least a very thin wrapper DLL.<br><br>(What I have done is <a href="https://github.com/Leushenko/Taranis" target="_blank">publicly committed to developing an updated Blitz Basic</a> with support for, among other things, function pointers. That will solve this problem in a different way, without compromising the original goal of language purity.) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
