The model is nice and <br>the texture needs work :)<br><br>The idle animation isn't too bad, although it is rather unnatural. No-one stands and breaths like that despite what video games tell you. <br><br>The run animation is robotic and un-realistic. The main problem is the leg swinging forward, if you ran like that the foot would hit the ground as it swings under the body (from the back). The foot should be higher to give some ground clearance.<br><br>The rigging could be better as well. I have been playing with rigging recently and have been using more exagerated poses with better deformation of the mesh I'm using. For example on the top of the leg if you add an extra row of verts to the leg bone you will get the leg going inside the hips but the shape will hold better and it will hide the crease. The same goes for the upper arm. Add more verts at the shoulder and it will look more natural.<br><br>You use max don't you? How did you get the model into blitz? I assume it was through unwrap3d?<br><br>Oh well... lets hope Mark sees this and adds blended vertex weights into blitz. Its not like no-one has asked :D <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'm not sure I actually exported the blended vertex weights correctly; I have reason to believe they aren't normalized (ie. weights on a vertex add up to 1) which would screw things up.  You probably shouldn't go ahead and try to get this working as is.<br><br>This was just a quick and dirty export test I thought looked kinda cool and I figured people would like to see it.  The ultimate purpose is to show Mark what blended vertex weights are good for, but for now I'm just doing a little show-and-tell.  I wanted to have something uploaded before I move (my computer will be in boxes by tomorrow afternoon.)  As you note the animation is very rough (eg. the robotic look is largely because I've not done any slow-in/slow-out to the movements) and the texture is non-existent (I setup UV coordinates but threw on flat colors for now; if you want to try painting her let me know and I'll send you the UV template.)  Not too shabby for a day of work (other than the mesh) but that's all this is, a day of work.<br><br>Oh, and this was animated in CharacterFX.  I haven't used 3D Studio Max in almost a year now.  Right now I'm really looking forward to purchasing Maya. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Don't bother holding space for the run animation, just examine the shoulders in the standing pose.  Notice how the shoulders peak sharply (as opposed to rounding over naturally) and the polygons on the sides are stretched out (as opposed to the nice uniform vertex density on the rest of the model.)<br><br>BTW in the standing pose the arms/shoulders are the only part which are moved from the pose she was modeled and rigged in.  I modeled her arms out so for the standing pose I rotated her arm bones down.  Since everything else is pretty much unmoved from the modeled/rigged pose there is no stretching or buckling of polygons anywhere else in the standing pose. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
