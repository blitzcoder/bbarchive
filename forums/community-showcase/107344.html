The shadow should be "retro style" so a semitransparent black 2-3px border, no "fade out" needed<br><br>- the inventory (right sided white-rounded-rectangle) just looks not like an inventory. Or is it some kind of "chest, weapon, shield, spell"-thingy (normally with a "body-shape" in the background) ? In all cases: make it occupy less space, make it look more "self describing", so eg. place a light rectangle on each spot, so people know: ahh you could place something there (or collect it somewhen)<br><br>- make the text on the "control rectangle" look a bit more fitting: better font choice, text align and especially MORE GRAPHICAL.

If you don't have the graphics chops - DONT ADD SOMETHING YOU RAN UP WITH A LAWNMOWER!<br>Enlage the main figure and just use a darkened gradient<br><br>Here's the best tip.<br>I'm a customer. I've seen loads of crap all day. and I'm going to look at your stuff for about 3 seconds and not read anything apart from a few words that take my interest.<br>If it looks like crap or things don't sit well (scifi font for a dungeon crawler for example) you've just lost me and I've moved on...<br>;)<br>look how it sits with the tiles - nicely positioned and sized<br>Also note that the new background is faded black - it's much better to have black as a null background not other colors. black look visually better<br><br>and finally:<br><img src="https://vjointeractive.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/5c.png"><br><br>this is now bigger, simpler and more phone friendly. you have the ability to move in half jumps which is more interesting in terms of game mechanics.<br><br>next up would be to twerk the color of the walls to be more harmonious. and we would need to stretch the door over 2 cells:<br><img src="https://vjointeractive.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/5d.png"><br><br>you could then have your items as single cells and they look right too...

So a left-right-positioned health bar is a "free space"-optimization. <br><br><br>@ weapons in pixel art<br>While animation of pixel  art is harder (you have to redraw many portions instead of just moving some bones and render the automatically tweened frames) it is easier to replace weapons and armor, just because there are less details (only if pixelart is "scaled" and not also in "4k" ;-)).<br><br><br>@ sorcerer<br>you know a "typical" sorcerer cannot wear shields but wears magic bulbs, lanterns or whatever. So you might introduce class-specific weapons/armor.<br><br><br>If you are interested we ("community") could surely help creating some assets or ideas. Thinking of "spikes out of the ground"-spell-effects, Frozen cones, ...<br><br><br>As I did not play it yet: hope you introduced traps already, or holes in a level (first hit on a ground: breaking more and more, second move over it, first holes and last move: hole and dead).<br><br><br>Introduce different doors: wooden ones could be opened with enough attacks (warrior) or spells like "fire" (mage).<br><br><br>Introduce lighting: torches and fire places in levels (which you can light up). Light removes some power / harmfullness of the "dark powers coming from hell".<br>(while I of course also like the opposite dungeon way: you have to defend the invading knights who want to steal treasures for their kingdom - and this "view to dungeons" allows for really filthy and dirty traps, jokes and gameplay options).<br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I suggest to add a help screen with instructions (maybe it already exists)<br><br>The combat system is ok but too primitive imo, maybe add a way for the user to increase its attack value (critical hit) or defense value (dodge) by pressing a key at the right time ?<br><br>The blood animation is rather cool but i suggest to make the blood spreads only on the cell where the character is.<br><br>A big improvement would be to create different bodies/armors/weapons and to build each character shape/colors depending on that. (since your characters are not animated, it would be easy to do that)<br><br>The screens where you mix your own drawings and scaled up "pixelated" characters are not consistent with the graphics style of the game. I suggest to modify them in order to keep the same graphics style.<br><br>These are just some critics/suggestion after a quick play, do what you want with it... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
