For those of you who downloaded the game earlier and it would not run, it should run fine now, I'd be interested to read from you whether it works now (97% confident that it should).<br><br>The new download link is (19.6MB) shown below.<br>I've not updated the screenshots but the graphics in the version below differ a fair amount.<br><br>For those who haven't tried it already and don't know how it plays the basic premise is as follows:<br><br>Run the game - select from 1 - 6 heroes to fight with through the dungeon, select a dungeon to fight in.  When the game first loads you can simply press play and it will default to the 1 dungeon included so far and all 6 characters.<br><br>In the game - take a turn with each of your characters in moving (press cursor keys to move to the next grid square, moving into a door will open it, moving into treasure will pick it up.)  Press TAB or the "X" button in the lower right to end that character's turn.  Left clicking on an enemy when next to them (not diagonally) will activate a melee attack (wizard has no melee attack).  Left clicking on an enemy when not adjacent will activate a ranged attack (paladin, monk, barbarian do not have ranged attacks).  Each character's actions are shown as icons, they may be used a certain number of times per turn and recharge at varying rates.  A description of the action will appear in the bottom right console window when the mouse is placed over the action icon.  <br><br>The objective is to find the big bad boss monster and kill him, usually by fighting through a number of lesser enemies first.<br><br><br>Known Issue:If you have difficulty activating an attack by left clicking  try right clicking once then left clicking on your target.<br><br>As the characters kill monsters and collect treasure their experience increases, at certain points they will 'level up' giving them added combat ability, increased health and usually some new abilities.<br>Abilities marked with two ^ arrows are 'upgrades' that cause permanent changes to the character, usually better combat performance.  <br><br>New features included in this version are:<br><br>Display all enemies visible to the characters by holding down  "Enter" on the keyboard - any that are obscured because standing too close to a wall will become visible.<br><br>Save Feature - press Escape in game to bring up the in game menu, you can save the game, and give it a specific name.  Games can be loaded from the front menu.<br><br>Save &amp; Watch Replay - if you wish to record a game then you can do so once the game is over.  They can be reloaded at the main menu.  This may have bugs in it - if you find creatures behaving in an unusual way then something may have gone wrong with the replay feature.  I'm not 100% sure what causes this but have some ideas.<br><br>Lighting - each of the characters has a light radius which is simply a visual effect, torches on the walls do so as well.  Spell effects also have a light radius, for example the fireballs emit light as they move from start to finish.<br><br>Screenshots can be taken by pressing F5 in the game itself. (will save as bitmap, until I work out how to save as JPEG).<br><br><br>Please note, although the graphics have improved there is still a long way to go.  <br><br>Download link here: 19.6MB<br><br><a href="http://home.swiftdsl.com.au/%7ETmalcolm/tom/ADG_B.zip" target="_blank">http://home.swiftdsl.com.au/%7ETmalcolm/tom/ADG_B.zip</a><br><br><br><textarea class=codebox name="code" wrap=OFF readonly="true" rows="15" cols="80">]Hello again,

I've been working on a game for the last few weeks and thought I'd show where I'm at with it.

The game is a turn based game.  It is NOT an RPG.  It is more of a fantasy tactical game although the 
characters do gain skills with experience.  Each gameplay experience is a short half hour to one hour
affair through an environment filled with monsters &amp; treasure.  The objective is to eliminate the 'boss' monster,
who is identified by the glowing red cloud billowing about his feet.

There is a lot of place holder graphics &amp; sounds in this version.  The icons in the menus and in-game especially placeholder.

**	If anyone wants to help me by creating some decent icons for the menus/in game icons then I may be interested  		**

I've included some screenshots below.
I've also included the link the a download of a ZIP file containing a playable game.  Instructions are included in a text file
within (should be fairly easy to find).  

Download is 18MB.

**	I feel a little lost when it comes to completing game projects, I'd love to hear from anyone who has completed a game, and I 
know there are a few of you on this site, how you can tell when your game is complete as well as what essential features there are
for a game to be considered complete.  	**





The level included with the game is able to be completed, I'd be interested to hear if you found it too easy/too difficult. Instructions in ZIP file.

It's tricky because you can't work on an image and copyrect it because copyrect doesn't copy the alpha, if I recall correctly.<br><br>I don't know what the problem is. Certainly I never used to get this behaviour, but I've not used B3D in a few years now. Possibly a bug in B3D or some recent drivers? I'm using the latest Nvidia drivers with an 8600 GTS. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
