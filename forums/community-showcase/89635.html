I made a demo media pack (demopack) and a silly demo map called "demo" that you can load straight away through the file menu.  If a map is currently lightmapped, the lightmap is saved to the file.  Lights aren't saved to files.  Didn't get 'round to properly managing lights.  I was going to have all kinds of things.

Jesus...  Look.  Look how old the video is.  I made it to show to mathmaticians (that my brother knows) who are more interested in the 3D engine maths than the final result, long before I realised I could showcase it here to my PEERS WITH THE SAME INTERESTS.  I am not ashamed to be a Blitzer.  If I was I wouldn't be on the forums and contributing like 5 things a week to the code archives.<br><br>In my life I've been on 4 forums, and on every single one I've been ganged up on after my FIRST POST over a misunderstanding, some of which I can't even blame them for.   I swear to God.  Can that not happen here please because Blitz is like my only hobby?  I want to get along with everyone.<br><br>And yeh, Romanski, thanks.  It IS my decision to release the code or not.  I said it was intertwined with other code that I don't want out there but some people think its as easy as "just remove it".  That is a huge job.  And if I don't do it properly then the code I release will need a LOT of rewriting and filling-in before it'll even do anything.  I don't even know if I have the original meshes etc so I might even have to remake them in a format Vanilla blitz can read without my lib.<br><br>However I AM going to try to work on the code to make it releasable, even though I'm busy with a commercial project, because I've practically decided that I'm not going to do anything commercial with this code anyway, so it should be out there, really.  If I do release it, it will be an archive of several files (includable libraries etc).  Can anyone tell me how to make that archive available and where to post it?  Cheers.<br><br>Edit: Meh, screw it.  I'll just release it as-is, media libs and-all.  But you'll need FMOD and that zip lib to run it.  My media archiving uses FMOD because it does extra things and, most importantly, lets you load samples from memory instead of only from file =D  I think the media lib itself will prove more useful than the mapper :P ... ALSO I was gonna use the media lib in commercial projects so it's a big deal for me to release it.  If you do use FMOD commercially you'll need to buy a one-off indie license.<br><br>Now please.  I come in peace.  I LOVE Blitz.  That comment was out of context.  It REALLY was.  Can we start again? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

At the start of the code there's a constant called BuildMode.  if its 0, it uses the basic media files.  If it's 1, it uses the all-in-one compiled file.  If it uses 2 it compiles the all-in-one media file and runs in compiled mode.  If it uses 3 it compiles and quits (so compiling is as easy as changing the value of BuildMode and pressing F5 :P .  And it's all driven from a media list file that looks like:<br><br>[TEXTURE WALL2]<br>Filename=Media\textures\wall3.png<br>Mask=WALL2MASK<br>Flag=11<br>Group=Industrial<br><br>[SOUND MOO]<br>Filename=Media\sounds\moo.mp3<br>Looped=yes<br>Preload=yes  &lt;- means load it when the program starts instead of when it's called upon<br><br>[MESH ROBOT]<br>Filename=Media\meshes\robot.3ds<br><br>And when you want to use one in your project you just use:<br>tex=Texture("Wall2")<br>snd=Sound("Moo")<br>Mesh=MakeMesh("Robot") (i THINK its makemesh!)<br><br>Plus other media types.  When you compile it, every file is compiled into one media file.  There's also a language file that's compiled so you can easily add new language options.  There's a config file that sets graphics mode (0,0 means it finds the highest mode available) and language file.<br><br>I can't remember if anything else is compiled.<br><br>Oh... and projects with my media lib use every media file in the data folder.  So its easy to add "modules".  Lets say you have media.rcf in the data folder which is your main module with all your media in it.  If you copy addon.rct (or whatever) in to the data folder and run the editor, you'll find all of it's content is available.  Or .lst if its the uncompiled equivelent.  I had modding in mind.<br><br>Also like i mentioned earlier the sounds are driven with FMOD, and the media is handled with a zip lib.  I think it was zlib.... I won't be able to suply those with the source code but I'll supply my .decls files and hopefully links to where you can get the 2 dlls.  I'll suply a few textures and maybe a demo map, and the sound effects the editor uses.<br><br>OMG there are 17 libraries in this that I have to sort out and tidy up a bit.  I better get my due acknowledgement if someone uses this or one of its libs :P<br><br>And yeh, I might have been overly defensive.

Sorry, but I'm getting comments that require defense.  I'm trying to just wrap all of this up.<br><br>At risk of turning this thread in to a flame war, your comments (Plash) are pedantic and provocative.  <i>"Then just remove it."</i>  Jeez.  Do you pick apart what everyone says or just people who have offended you at some point?  Oh, wait.  I didn't offend you.  I'm confused.  It's like saying "My roof is broken" and someone going "Well, fix it, then." as if it's that simple.  Rude.  In real life you wouldn't dream of talking to someone like that.  I know I wouldn't.  That's how you respond to people who you have a grudge with.  If you don't have a grudge with me then I'm sorry.  But it really seems like you do.  Not saying it's the drama of the century but I'm just addressing how you seem to percieve me.<br><br>My comment on the video is still being talked about.  Fair enough.  The fact that it's still there proves I don't censor or backtrack.  I don't take it back.  But, again, it was meant in a specific context.  It was misunderstood.  I've done nothing wrong and so I find myself compelled to explain it.<br><br>I love Blitz3D (and have done since it's release), I appreciate all the contributions to the code archives - some of which have made a big difference (the YAL lightmapper blows me away!) and I really admire some of the contributers, I like the people on the forums, some of their showcases makes my jaw drop, I'm proud of my projects and achievements in B3D.... But guess what.  When talking to people who make 3D engines from scratch, I am embarrassed to be submitting my work as "a 3D engine" as I did not make that aspect of it.  Doesn't mean I'm ashamed of Blitz.  It just means I'm embarrassed to be submitting a project made in it as something it isn't - a personal fete of DirectX technology interface.  Having said all that, read the comment again.  "It was made in Blitz3D which is slightly embarrassing."  Does it make more sense now?  This was talking to people who showcase their assembly engines and explain it in algebra (or something) that looks like arabic to me.  Then I come along and go "Uuhhhh.... Yeah I make 3D engines too."<br><br>And if you think I'm being overly defensive again, I'm just explaining myself as best I can.  I waffle on sometimes.  I just don't want to have a bad start on the forums because I plan on being here a while. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
