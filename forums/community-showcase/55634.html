Because it is easy to code, fun, and I have pretty much all the graphics and sounds I need for it at hand.  The only thing I will need to do is hire a musician to write some XM tunes when the game is near completion. <br><br>It's coming along pretty nicely so far.  <br><br>The sprites were low res originally but I used a Photoshop trick I invented that produces results similar to those of Gameboy emulators to increase the resolution by 3x.  (Scale by 300% using nearest neighbor filtering and apply a 1 pixel median filter.)<br><br>Since I'm working with what I have available for graphics, the game will be a bit wacky.  The powerups include things like watermelon, a turkey leg, a sneaker with wings, and an umbrella.  <br><br>As you will see, each enemy will have its own specific attack patterns, and issues a "battle cry" when it appears on the screen.  The demo has three enemis, though only two have a battle cry at this time.  Many of the enemies will fire bullets off at random to create a little more chaos than there is right now.  The control is with the mouse to make it more accessable to the casual gamer, but I think you'll find even with the mouse, when an enemy is moving in a sine wave it's kinda hard to hit, and you will have bullets and more enemies to worry about in the final version.<br><br>Another interesting thing about the demo is the scrolling star background.  I found that even at high framerates, you get a "strobing" effect on fast moving objects.  This is a condition where you see an object in two locations at the same time, and flickering.  Apparently this is an optical illusion caused by your eyes when an object does not overlap from one frame to the next as it moves.  So your framerate dictates how fast objects can move, and if they move faster than their width allows and you don't have motion blur, then you get this strobing effect.  So that's exactly what I did... Implement a cheap sort of motion blur.  I basically just render a line from where a star was in the last frame, to where it is in the current frame.  Thus stars that move faster get stretched out more, and if the framerate is lower, the game compensates with more of this fake motion blur.  The results are pretty impressive, as the scrolling is much smoother this way than how it was without the stretching.<br><br>Anyway, here's the demo.  It's fairly basic.  There is a tile screen which you press any key or the mouse button to skip, and in the game you move the mouse and press the mouse button repeatedly to fire.  The game does not yet spawn enemies automatically, so you will need to press the buttons 1-4 to activate the various attack patterns.  If you want to see the other enemies and bosses, and the powerups, and hear the various sound effects that will be in the game, they are included in the zip.<br><br><a href="http://www.seamlesstexturegenerator.com/asb/asb.zip" target="_blank">http://www.seamlesstexturegenerator.com/asb/asb.zip</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This looks okay in some cases, but because it has a hard cutoff point rather than smoothly transitioning between blending and not blending, you get these sharp transitions in the middle of some gradients.  It looks better and more retro to just have the gradients all be stepped than to have these blurry portions mixed with these sharp transitions.<br><br>I also tried another util which was made by the author of one of those graphics enhancers, and that too did not produce satisfactory results.<br><br>Of course, the results I get with my own method are not perfect either, but I thought they looked better than the other methods.  I think I could write a function to do a better job than the ones I found and this photoshop method, but I really don't have the time to waste on that.  You can't even really see the detail when the enemies are moving about anyway.<br><br>But the main problem with these setups is detecting the curvature of edges.  If you have a shape like this:<br><br><pre class=code>
 #
# #
 #
</pre><br>Then that needs to be translated into a circle, but my median methods and the other methods turn something like that into more of an octagon or diamond shape.  I think maybe you need to do something similar to metablobs to get the best shape. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Link is the same as above.  This version will give you around 500 fps in windowed mode (no vwait) and whatever your screen refresh is in fullscreen mode.  Press F to toggle between the two.<br><br>I tried erasing the stars by drawing over them, and I sorted the stars as well to get rid of the readpixels, but it turned out that this was not the real bottleneck.  I only got perhaps 3fps more using that method than by simply clearing the buffer each frame.<br><br>It turns out that what I really needed to do was use image flag 2 on the star backdrop image.  See, I haven't been drawing the stars to the screen itself.  I have been drawing them to an image which I could then blit to the screen with my BOB system.  This was probably a bad idea, but I did it because I thought it would be faster for some reason I no longer remember.  I think I thought it would be faster to erase individual stars from an image in video memory and then draw individual stars to said image than it would be to clear the screen.  <br><br>Anyway, flags 1 and 3 keep a copy of the image in main memory so it won't get corrupted when you switch from windowed to fullscreen mode and back.  2 does not do this.  So I have to clear the star image each frame to account for that.  But even with that, because flag 2 keeps the image only in video memory it's not copying all the image data over the agp every frame, so it is much faster.  I guess the card can clear the image on the card which is fast, rather than sending the data to clear the image over the agp.<br><br>I might now try simply clearing the screen and blitting the stars to the screen which is what I should have done in the first place, being the most obvious and simplest solution. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This keeps the game from hogging all the CPU resources and also keeps the mouse movement smooth.  If the game is allowed to run at 500fps then the ship will move really fast when the mouse is moved because it is simply checking and updating the movement so often it is not calculating the mouse speed accurately.  However, in the interest of people being able to check their true framerate I have added a hotkey, V, which toggles both the framerate clamp and vwait check off.

This (as I'm sure you know) means a value of 3.8 goes to 3 instead of 4.  Why do you want that kind of rounding?.  Adding 0.5 to it gets rid off the effect of bankers rounding but still rounds perfectly (i.e. 0.5s always go up instead of up then down then up then down etc. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
