We look forward to your new batch of critiques! :)<br><br>History:<div class="quote"> Dated May 31st, 2007:<br>Chris:<br><br>Let me first start out by introducing Hopping Stone Games. HSG is a fledgling company, named so because the games we are making are our 'stepping stones' towards bigger and better things. For now, we are focusing on making many small productions to expand our horizons and increase our understanding of BlitzMax, and possibly other languages as well. HSG currently is Mike Wojtkowski and Chris Arendt.<br><br>Now, the game...<br><br>Metalord is a small two-day project that was officially the first Hopping Stone Games production. Because it was written and playtested in only two days, of course some things may be lacking here and there. The point is that it was made in two days, and that we were, at the time, trying to make as many games as possible. However, I think it's a fun little game with enough gameplay to keep you occupied for a half hour or so, and a good addition.<br><br>So, more on the game. It's a top to bottom space scroller, wherein the objective is to earn points. The player earns points mainly through avoiding asteroids, but is capable of earning through breaking up the rock formations with their trusty laser cannon. There are a total of four different pick-ups to be obtained, each with a unique result; A health pickup repairs/upgrades your ship, therefore increasing its lifespan, a cooldown pickup reduces the amount of time between shots, a gun pickup increases the number of shots fired each time, and a whipeout pickup explodes all nearby asteroids.<br><br>Please visit our website, www.HoppingStone.com for download, screenshots, how to play, system requirements, etc. We thank you for the support!<br><br><br>On a side note, I would appreciate if you guys could answer a few questions for me:<br><br>A) Is it legal for Mike and I to share one account (to use on the forums, get updates, etc.)? If so, do we both need seperate copies of BlitzMax?<br><br>B) When we post a game, should we include a copy of all the stuff (stuff about the game, screenshots, how to play, system requirements, etc.), or should we just do it like done here?<br><br>C) What license are we required to use when we release games? I just used the "Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 United States" one provided by CreativeCommons.org. Is that okay?<br><br>Thanks for all! <br></div> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'll complain more today and get him to fix it.

I figure that if most people were actually able to search the site, there might be more people that could, but we'll still definately take that into consideration. However, are you sure that it wasn't the puzld1 game that you were trying to download? Puzld1 isn't available at the moment (hence the x through the download image...).<br><br>About the questions, thanks! Though of course I still need the last question answered, I was wondering... can we get 2 copies under the same name?

I'll disable it for now to make things work, but this really is quite ungood :'(<br><br>I tried fixing how the image backgrounds aren't matching up with the site bg in IE, but it'll require us to fill in the images and upload them and stuff, so that'll be done later on after I get out of school.<br><br>Now, to the person that said screenshots didn't work.

That's interesting...<br><br>About the controls, I wasn't under the impression arrow keys were considered odd for movement. I guess I can change it to support WASD as well, but usually WASD is used for fps games. Still, not to hard to do. The mouse I used for shooting probably because I play fps games a lot, and heliattack had it like this, too. I understand that shooting upwards would be possibly easier, but it would just be too unoriginal. We're trying to remake games that are already out there, with special twists. Obviously, using the mouse to shoot instead of te keyboard or ctrl isn't much of a twist, but you get the point.<br><br>As for the chance or skill, actually, if you play the game for more than 30 seconds, then you'll realize that you can actually get better. My friend actually doubled his points each time he played. At first he complained that it was too hard too, but neither of us actually expected him to bet the best the first time.<br><br>About the uininstall not removing the folder, I'm hoping you mean the startmenu folder. If so, then I can understand, because I altered where the icons were put, and must have forgotten to change where the uninstaller removes them from too.<br><br>Edit: <br><div class="quote"> As far as I know, there is nothing to stop someone from purchasing as many licences of bmax as they please.
