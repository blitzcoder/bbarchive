We make high quality custom arcade consoles.  I have also posted my info at GarageGames.  If you have any questions at all please contact me at ed.farias@... or post in this thread.<br><br>My plan is to get a good list of games that would work well with an Arcade style control set, and would bring that arcade feel back most of us had in our youth.<br><br>We are not really in the business of producing games, at least not yet.  What I want to try and do is get more of these great game out there, and the only way I know how is using my Arcade Boxes :).  Below are a few simple guidelines that are important to the success of a game in this type of setup.<br><br>First, the layout of the controller: ([url]www.arcadeinabox.com/paul1.jpg[/url] this is an example of common arcade control panel layout)<br>1 and 2 player 8 way joysticks (non analog).<br>6 buttons per player<br>1 and 2 player start buttons<br>1 and 2 player coin in buttons<br>ESC button to exit game and return to the game list.<br>3" Arcade Style Trackball with 3 mouse buttons (LMB, MMB, and RMB)<br>Arcade Spinner.<br>All of these parts come from Happ Controls, the leader in arcade quality controls and buttons.<br><br>The buttons interface to the computer with a keyboard interface board.  These boards mimic keyboard presses, but at a much with a higher throughput and no chance of ghosting.  The standard button layout is as follows<br><br>Player 1 Joystick uses UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys for directions.<br>Buttons 1-6 uses  Left Control, Left Alt, Space, Left Shift, Z, X (In that order 1-6)<br>1p Start uses 1 (normal keyboard 1, not numpad)<br>1p coin in uses 5 (normal keybard 5, not numpad)<br>Player 2 Joystick uses - R (up), F (down), G (right), D (left) for direction<br>Buttons 1-6 uses  A, S, Q, W, I, and K (in that order 1-6)<br>2p Start uses 2 (normal keyboard, not numpad)<br>2p Coin in uses 6 (normal keyboard, not numpad)<br>ESC is used to exit the game.<br><br>One big draw of the Arcade-in-a-Box is the ability to plug the box into any TV via Composite or S-Video, although VGA is also an option, but we want to work with the lowest common denominator here.  640x480 is the best with those TV connections, although 800x600 will work pretty good as well.  The game should be locked into one resolution.<br><br>All options screens should be removed as the game should just start right up.  Having the user insert coins would be a great addition, but not needed at all.  Just helps add to that arcade feel.<br><br>You know all the buttons (keypresses) you have to work with, so you could do anything you like.  If you want the player to have the ability to save, you could have a quick save on one button and quick load on another  Just remember, that the whole purpose of an arcade style game, is there is no keyboard hooked up except for initial configuration.<br><br>I am also looking for ideas on designing a way, in windows, to make these game available via download from the game menu itself.  Sort of like Xbox Live Arcade, any ideas or help with that would be much appreciated.<br><br>I don't want to put out the impression that I am a large company, that simply isn't true.  I do the construction of all the boxes myself (with the help of computerized routers).  I've been doing custom arcade cabinets and boxes for about 5 years now.<br><br>I take great pride in my arcade boxes.<br><br>Thanks for reading all of that :).<br><br>Ed <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Couple questions:<br><br>- Presumably the trackball works off the mouse controls, but how would we read the spinner input?<br><br>- Are you only interested in old school, 2D (sprite) type games, or flashy 3D ones, aswell?<br><br>- Got any examples of the type/style of games you're after?<br><br>- Presumably, most of your customers are only interested in running MAME etc. Do you think there really is a big enough market for new, custom games written specifically to run on your system?<br><br>P.S.

The trackball and spinner both work off mouse controls.  One is plugged in via usb, and one with the ps/2 port.  The trackball, by default, has 3 buttons that act as your standard 3 mouse buttons in windows.  The big difference with the spinner is windows still sees it as a mouse, but it only moves on the Horizontal (X) plain.<br><br>2.  If a 3d game can be worked out with the control set, then I say go for it.  Just remember that the player joysticks are not analog, only 8 way directional.<br><br>3.  Nothing specific really, I'm leaving that up to the individual developers.  Remakes of classic games are always a good way to start, of course with a different name and mondernized graphics.  :)<br><br>4.  Yes, MAME is the big draw.  Problem is the copyrights to the roms, and I am tired of trying to deal with a way around it.  I don't provide any roms, so having a turnkey type setup is pretty much out of the question.  Except for the few roms from www.starroms.com that I can provide legally.  As far as a market, I don't really know.  I'm seeing the success of Xbox Live arcade and thinking there must be a market out there for this.  But if a developer is a making a game anyway, it probably won't take a lot of work to change it a bit to be arcade controls friendly, so the time and effort put into should be worth it, hopefully.<br><br>What I am thinking about is designing a sort of webportal where users can either purchase games on CD and install them on their arcade boxes/cabinets.  Or if their box is online they can download the games directly.  The back end of the website will have an area for each developer where they can upload their games, set pricing and manage the tech support aspect.  Whether a small amount of the purchase ammount will go to the site for bandwidth and maintenance will be determined by the one doing the site.  I have a few friends in mind that are extremely good at doing web stuff, so we'll see.<br><br>I hope I answered your questions. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I could really see that working great with a spinner, but having the joystick work as well is a great idea.  That way if somone opts not to purchase a spinner with their unit, they can still play the game.<br><br>As far as units sold, there not many of my units out there right now.  Even though I have been doing this for a while, I've stayed relatively quiet it about it until now. There are probably around 20 of my all in one units out there right now.  However, in the big picture this could be something that anyone building arcade machines would be interested in.  There are lots of companies out there that make and sell full size arcade cabinets as well and we would try to bring as many in as possible.<br><br>I'm launching a pretty big marketing pull here very soon, this is why I am trying to get as much coordinated as possible.  Attack of the Show on G4tv has shown a lot of interest in checking out one of my boxes, so if I can have this setup by the time that happens, that would be a huge plus not only for me, but for all your developers out there.<br><br>I am also working on a deal with an arcade shop in Canada that will possibly be requesting 5-10 boxes per month.  We'll see how that pans out.  Most of this stuff is happening now without me even doing a lot of marketing. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

(And this is not the current website you are seeing, that site is old looking and a new one is being designed by a professional as we speak).<br><br>Remember, this will be setup specifically for games designed to run on arcade style setups. I'll link a tech sheet to the bottom of this blog that you can download. It will give you a lot of information about what the system can and can't do.<br><br>The plan right now is as follows.<br><br>Developers will be able to create an account. From their admin page they can upload games, set pricing, and manage their tech support inquiries. The admin page will also include stat tracking so they know exactly how many times their games were viewed and purchased.<br><br>When you upload your game there will be some options like Game Type, Controllers used, 1p or 2p etc. Plus a little section for you to write a nice summary about your game.<br><br>Your games will not be available right after uploading them. They will be briefly tested on a working arcade cabinet, and setup with a custom install that is compatible with the system.<br><br>The site owner (me) will then send payments via paypal at the end of each Month to each individual developer.  I can send checks as well. <br>I chose to do it this way for a few reasons. 1. You know exactly how well your game is doing, sales wise. and 2. You know I didn't just buy copy from you and installing on every arcade box I sell. 3. Having the money sent directly from paypal was a good idea, except if more that one game was purchased from seperate developers it gets pretty messy. <br><br>I want to support the indie community as much as I can. I am not looking to make money off your hard work. With that said, a small fee (probably a dollar or two) per sale will go to me for server maintenance and bandwidth. If that fee turns out to be more than needed, then we will do stuff to get more people to the site via advertising, contests, etc.<br><br><br>I have a few thoughts and questions though, as I am sure all of you do.<br><br>Are you comfortable with a plan like this? If not, why not?<br><br>How do you currently restrict piracy with your games? I have a few options I am thinking of, but just <br>wanted to get your thoughts first as some of you might have a great way of doing it already.<br><br>Is there any other feature you would like to see?<br><br>Thanks again, and here is the above mentioned tech sheet.<br>www.arcadeinabox.com/games/aiabtechsheet.doc<br><br>One side note, I am not looking for exclusive rights to games.

I could probably get my project in gear, even tho it's a 2D game with 3D polygons used throughout, I do have plans to get my game looking widescreen soon.  Hope that I can be a third-party game developer, but to have someone publish a game of mine to get it onto that console, that may take some thinking.<br><br>One thing's for sure tho, porting a game from Blitz into your console would be a lot easier than porting to an XBox, Pocket PC, or a PS2.

(Different versions of the game, depending on your joystick that you're using), and since I do have a 32" widescreen that's attached to my desktop, I usually go for the gusto, and go all out to 1280x720 (which is mainly the resolution that X360 uses for their high-end games).  <br><br>I usually use my laptop to develop the 4:3 versions of the games around a keyboard, and maybe a regular PC game controller.

You'll see what I mean, "When It's Done."  Doesn't that "WID" line sound familiar?  If you've been hanging around the 3D Realms forum site, it should sound VERY familiar...  Hehe, different topic there, sorry.<br><br>Back on the topic at hand, seems like this may look like a great idea for a revival of the arcade as we've known it, and this seems like something for you to test out.  I'm probably pushing for an Easter completion on my original Beta version of Plasmorg with the keyboard and mouse version.  The joystick/gamepad versions may come out towards May, possibly, to give you an idea, my game's going to be programmed around this joystick:  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=3504720" target="_blank">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=3504720</a> (The Logitech Dual Action), that, and maybe a second XBox/X360-style joystick version.  Not too sure if I'm gonna port this to any game console, that would require converting the code to C++.  I'll see how far I get with this.  Thanks for your enthusiasm. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That is the business plan for the future, but hopefully not that far into the future.  <br><br>If I can keep the cost of the units to a reasonable price point, I'm hoping restaurants, bars, etc. might take the risk to try them out.  Maybe even drop a few into local places here to get a feel for the cashflow they would bring in.  <br><br>There is a lot going on in my business plan right now, but a lot of it is centering around the indie development community.  If the games are not there, then their really isn't a point.  But I have been very impressed with arcade style games coming out of blitz and dxgame engines, that I figure why not give it a shot.  Plus, give these smaller developers a shot.  <br><br>You figure, if a place of business bought a full size cabinet unit from me (say 2,000-2500 for base unit) and an exclusive license to one of your games.  (200- 1000 dollars or whatever).  <br><br>Now, if that machine brings in only 10 dollars a day, it would take a year to pay it off.  10 dollars a day doesn't seem like much to be in a high traffic area.

Should be interesting having two different versions of my game.  Actually, the Revolution wouldn't be a hard console for homebrew games, since the SDK is gonna be rather cheap, just like the console itself.  Nintendo's not nearly as money hungry as Sony and Microsoft are, so that'll be good.  Highly doubt that Blitz would work on game consoles, but with your arcade cabinet, I'll most certainly provide you with my original release, which will be sometime, hopefully Easter, maybe later, depending on how the game looks.  Maybe have you as a beta tester to see how it would work, and how the game would sell in your cabinet (hopefully you or I won't fluke like Atari did in the 80s).

</pre><br><br>I'll just write the code in small batches for different functions.  That's the way I always programmed.  I usually write one part of the game, and then another, then I just do final program code assembly at the end, and make it all come together.  Seems like this may be the best way to start.  <br><br>The WaitKey function sounds somewhat generic, not too sure if there's a better way to lock in the start and coin-in functions to make the program only respond to those keys at all.<br><br>Also, I know that the keyboard control map is in there, you can replace that with the diagram of the arcade control map. I just used that, because most of my game programs are influenced by XBox games that use the controller map to tell you how to play the game.  I've been trying to get into console programming, but unless I know about the arcade controls, there's really no way to tell the player what buttons to press to shoot or move about.  There should be a way to tell the primary fire vs. the secondary fire buttons on that arcade control panel.  The D-Pad is the way to move about, obviously.  That, of course the coin drop, and the button to continue to the next screen, pause the game, and everything else.  The Start key is the continue and pause button, as we well know (just like a home game console).  This may not be a hard task, just need to know how to make the computer only respond to the "5" key or the "1" key during those "WaitKey()" commands, and not any of the other buttons (don't want a glitch that lets the player play without paying).  There's gotta be a better way around making the PC only let you play when the 5 is pressed or the coin is dropped... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
