Ever try it yourself?  It's not nearly as simple as the game might look in comparison to more "modern" offerings.<br><br>Among the real challenges was creating an AI player that was challenging, but not impossible.  Variable deflection angles off the paddle, calculating destination for the AI, limiting velocity to avoid unplayable volleys.  It wasn't a "single pass" kind of thing.<br><br>Also, preserving the look and feel - the charm - of the original game wasn't as automatic as it might seem.  I went first with "green" elements and tried a big, custom coded retro font.  It lost a lot until I just went back to the original style elements.  And I see this mistake made almost invariably by other developers.  They open up a paint program and create colorful raster images for the paddles and ball.  They use realistic sound samples of clanks and clunks for the audio.  But in the end, it seems to make the game feel...cheap.  At least to me.<br><br>Finally, creating responsive UI, even one as simple as this, takes multiple iterations; at least it did for me.  Little things like the space-bar pause, "Get Ready" after score but before serve, exit confirmations.  They all really add a lot to the experience, but are overlooked by eager "Pong Clone" developers.  <br><br>As you see, I have a long way to go to get where I want to with it.  What you see in the video took me about 20 man hours, all things considered.  I expect it to take at least another 100 or so to get it to Version 10 and maybe another 100 after that to port it to Monkey and get it on mobile. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

SetPaused() would run SetGameState(STATE_PAUSED) or SetGameState(STATE_RESUME)). <br><br>@AI:<br>Calculate distance to the position the ball will have when the players side is reached ("target"). If the distance is not reachable within time (maxDistance = availableTime * speed) then eg. the AI could have a text bubble or sound like "arggh / oh nooo!!!"). If the distance can be moved within time, you can decide how to play the ball (angles).<br><br>In all cases the AI would play "perfect" (regarding "accepting" the ball). To make difficulty less, you have to make the ai doing wrong things (by a random chance). This random chances could be lower - according to the current score. Playing the ball to the opponent is purely a matter of doing the same thing you did when the ball came to you: calculating distances. So if you know, that X is the impossible to reach distance, you try to play the ball towards this or even further. Using simple math you will get the needed angle (take into consideration playing on the sides to reverse the angle) so the player is not able to reach the ball.<br>If there is not such an distance - just play the ball with a random angle (you could of course do some prediction but this is not hmm that simple and wont improve AI that much).<br><br><br>@networking<br>When writing the code, check that you have functions doing specific actions, something like "MovePaddle(plusminus)" so you just have to call the same function when you receive specific commands via networking. What benefit do you have from this? You can have "local delay": you send your movement as soon as you pressed your key, but the local paddle is moved some milliseconds later - so it will hopefully be "executed" simultaneously on local and remote. Of course you have to execute things without delay as soon as you get the command via remote.<br>Another option is to let the remote verify certain thigs ("did not hit the ball") but this is then not the nicest visual representation as you locally see the ball not getting hit by the paddle, while the remote sees that hit. After verification failing, the ball will suddenly be bounced by the paddle.<br><br>As ping between ween LAN is &lt;20ms this wont be recognizeable, during online game the latency will be higher, the ping (a-&gt;b + b-&gt;a) doubled. Such an "speedy" game wont be nice to play with a ping of 150 or higher as you then have recognizeable local lags.<br><br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It might be an eye opener.<br><br><div class="quote"> the AI could have a text bubble or sound like "arggh / oh nooo!!!" <br></div><br>This sounds like a good idea and it is the kind of modernization that PONG cloners often code in.  It has been my experience, though, that things like this actually take away from the quality of the development.  "Tropes" are a real psychological phenomenon when it comes to game development and PONG is, in total, its own trope.  Any variation from the original has the potential to "violate" player expectations.  These kinds of things must be done extremely well to be effective.<br><br>Thank you very much for your advice regarding AI and network play.  I think you have some well thought-out plans here and I will definitely keep some of this in mind when I am developing these components in my game.

I lost many things that time (asset originals - psd/psp files - and sourcecodes, and of course many photos).<br>Todays sudokus provide way more features than mine did. Albeit I thought my "swirl" was also a nice bonus: there was a sand clock ticking and after acertain time numbers got "exchanged" ... so 2 got 9 and 9 got 2 etc. While this does not change game logic, it puzzles the brains :D - especially if the symbols were christmas items or famous persons ("arghhh Beethoven just got Brahms").<br><br>@Images/Themes<br>You have to take care, not to violate copyrights. Older pictures might be PD'ed, your own pictures are useable for sure - and numbers, yeah ... think nobody claims rights on them (yet).<br><br><br>@non-game projects:<br>They got used to make hardware useable. The hardware existed and generated output. I was reliable to make the output somehow "viewable" or "processed". Eg. were was the functionality to analyze incoming data and categorize them according to some kind of bayesian rules, it was an analysis of poo running through a tunnel to generate fermentation gas - and the analysis was there to measure humidity and so on. The system has to automatically recognize incorrect "mixture" (there is some kind of perfect mixture for that poo :p) so another automatism could correct things. Next to it people needed a "viewer" to visualize what happens there and to manual mark things so the filters could improve.<br>That tool was an inhouse production and is not sold outside.<br><br>The benefit of producing something in BlitzMax: there are not that many persons in a company able to modify your code that easy than it would be with C or Java. So you have a fertile future with supporting that apps. But this is also a disadvantage as you might not be the one they choose to write a little support tool.<br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
