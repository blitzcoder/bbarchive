You give away 13 puzzles out of 40. Now, After playing the 13 puzzles.. why would anyone pay 19.95 if they have completed a little more than 1/4 of the game for free? My first suggestion is to only show maybe 5 levels perhaps. Of the five, only the first 2 easy, then the other 3 get a LOT harder to make you want to buy ;)  <br><br>Also I do not believe 40 levels is nearly enough for $19.95 since I beat the first 13 in less than 10 minutes. Therefore in less than 1 hour I can completely beat the game. <br><br>Is there any way to add many more levels or have a random level generator? Also, I think you could make the puzzles even more challenging by adding additional features like magnets or something that operates on a rhythm, so not only do you need flipping skills but also timeing.<br><br>EpicBoy, I believe you have a potentially good game for puzzle lovers, but a real puzzle solver will beat this far to quickly. If this game was 4.95 I think Id say what the heck. But for $20, you better give a bang! For instance, I recently bought a puzzle book that contains 1,000 puzzles for $14.95 ;)  <br><br>Good work on gfx, sound, and playability. It just hasnt pushed its envelope. Hope you take this in a positive way. That is how it is meant.<br><br>-lucid <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's not flashy enough, nor is the demo limited enough.<br><br>Did you put it up on Download.Com?<br><br>Did you try time limiting the demo by allowing them to play the game only X number of times, rather than playing X number of puzzles?  This depends on whether the puzzles are fun to play more than once of course.  <br><br>Did you have butons to encourage registration in several obvious places in the program, rather than just at the end?<br><br>Did you accept multiple forms of instant payment/download?<br><br>Was the demo under 5 megs in size?<br><br>Did the demo run on lower end PCS, or only high end?<br><br><br>Lots of stuff that could make a game fail, not just poor marketing.

If you look at your download demo -&gt; sales conversion rate that's when you start getting into the nitty gritty of what you can do with the game to make it sell better.  I'm finding that there's a lot you can do to make or break a game's sales.<br><br>One thing I've been thinking of is increasing the number of levels in AA actually.  We've been using 5 levels and that sells ok.  I read a statistic that said that 86% of gamers who rent games also buy the title afterward.  That says to me that a gamer wants a big chunk of the game and then if they like it they'll buy it.  With AA we've sold a lot more then 1 copy but I know from my stats that it's not doing as good as it could be compared with similar games, thus I keep experimenting with new demos.<br><br>I think through all of this that I'm not actually a gameplayer anymore.  I don't think many of us are.  Sure we'll play a game occasionally but we're more about making them then buying them and we tend to just want to get the idea of a game, not to actually play it through.  Gamers are a different breed, they want to be completely absorbed into a game and then if they feel absorbed they'll spend the money.  <br><br>My advice is to find the right balance between too much gameplay and not enough.  That's where I'm at right now.  I think my next attempt is going to be a 60 minute demo with 15 - 25 levels.  At 25 levels that's half the game (well if you can beat that in 60 minutes), but back in the day Doom was the king of Shareware and that demo took forever to beat, yet it sold extremely well.  I know for a fact that Real Arcade does very very well by giving the whole game away with a 60 minute time limit.  So it doesn't seem so bad to give half the game away with the same time limit.  Mix and match time limiting and feature limiting can be good. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

One site said they sold more copies of their games to users who were not offered a demo on the website, than to users who were offered a demo.<br><br>Popcap's games, like Bejeweled, only offer you something like five plays of the full featured game and then it won't let you play again.  I plan to limit my own puzzle game in this manner.  <br><br>Of course the way in which you limit a game depends on the type of game.  <br><br>And if you don't offer a demo at all, then you'll have a hard time finding websites to offer your game and get the word out, since there will be no game to offer at all.

The buttons always appear in the same spot on the screen so you don't have to move your mouse up and down the screen to click the arrows in each window during cut scenes.  That would get highly annoying.<br><br>I could have positioned them halfway between the two or something, but even that looked weird.  In the end, this seemed to be a decent compromise.<br><br>As for the icons, well, originality isn't the goal.  Functionality is.  Is there any question what that red X button does?  No, everyone immediately knows. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

And that makes it look like a flaw. it's merely suggestion that that is the only flaw with the game design other then that i love it....And functionality is 1 thing but it's eye candy that sells. Now i personaly would be like "Hey thats from M$, what a rip off..." but thats just my opinion i could be wrong...<br><br><br>EDIT: I forgot to mention that i played out the demo in 3 mins... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
