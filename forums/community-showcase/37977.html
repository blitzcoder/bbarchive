Because you can't remove bad deals from the play field without buying them, the game board will end up clogged up with high priced items if you only go for the good deals.<br><br>When the average market value of the items on the game board is high, the best strategy is to simply buy everything. You make an incredible amount of money by simply diregarding price and buying random items as fast as you can.<br><br>When the average market value is similar (or a bit less) to the price of the items on the game board, you have to play tactically - and the game board will soon be clogged up with overpriced junk.<br><br>When the average market value is less - you're screwed. The only thing to do is hit the skip round button.<br><br>Market Value needs (in my opinion) two things:<br><br>a) A visual indicator of the price of the item with respect to its market value.<br><br>b) When you buy two items, instead of the items inbetween being purchased as well, they should be taken from the game board - *without* being purchased.<br><br>This will mean you can spot the good and bad deals easily, and tactically remove the bad deals. The market values would have to have a higher median and range to compensate, but you will end up with a much more enjoyable game. Right now, it is just a question of buy everything or buy nothing. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

What you said could work ... but then there's no loss (or way to fill the board and capitalize on them by waiting and strategically keeping them around) and in business you have to take calculated losses sometimes.  For example if the board is filled with books that are a bad deal but there is a good deal on sporting goods ... take the loss on the books to make room for other items. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This particular version Adrian was keen on using the lighting and 3D gamepieces.  The original prototype was 2D in 3D but then we moved to full 3D.  The game seems to run fine though even on the humblest of video cards (my cruddy 16 MB laptop's s3 handles it) because there's only the rendering and I don't think it ever goes beyond 50,000 polygons.  It's requirements are less than those of AA.  Of course doing it  in 2D would have been the optimal solution for sales but ... then there's the artistic essence ... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I doubt if I'd have made the game it I didn't have fun doing it, and the extreme low end takes all the fun out of my work. When we do a 2D version, it will take a couple of hours to render the current objects onto a texture page and a 2D backdrop to replace the 3D UI. could probably just take snapshots of the game rendered in blitz for the final 3D graphics, so long as antialiasing is on.<br><br>I think this is probably the lowest spec 3d game I would want to make, as I'm not really in it for the money, even though I do need the money, I'd rather to some hard labour than a game thats not fun to make. This one was a bit borderline as far as fun factor in development, but I believed in the game concept.<br><br>If it sells quite well in its current state were both quite willing to make a dumbed down graphics version. probably our first cross platform blitzmax game. Either that or have both a 2D and 3D version in the same EXE if Bmax gets a 3d module pretty quickly. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Some have problems with brush tiniting, vertex colours, 2X multiply, additive textures etc. <br><br>My guess is that the intel graphics chipset isn't 100% DX7 compatible. we noticed on some really early cards, lighting is different pre Geforce1 and comes out washed out. also the various methods of tinting we used don't seem to work, vertex colours or brush colours.
