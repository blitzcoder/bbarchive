Problem is how can I best accept credit cards. If you can get me some sites billing the credit cards (or semiliar paying methods) for me (preferably from the Netherlands, but the US is also fine) I'd be grateful.<br><br>Second, the game is yet in English and Dutch (as those are the only languages I speak fluently), if you like to make a translation in a language I don't know, then please do so. You can find the files with all the text the game contains in the "Lang" folder of the game, and I do believe experienced programmers like you won't have any trouble in figuring out how the language files work.<br><br>And of course tell me what you think of the concept. It's a simple concept, but I got the feeling it can be pretty addictive nevertheless. The game is practically finished, but if you got any advices for improovement, I'd like to hear it.<br><br>So far my questions. I hope you like this simple game ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Shareware games *can* sell with graphics like this, though.<br><br>2) I don't see exactly how you can have load times as long as you do. They should be just about instant, and anything over 3 seconds or so is an annoyance, especially in a game as simple as this.<br><br>3) The menu has keyboard control while the game uses mouse control.<br><br>4) The background in the menu is completely and utterly annoying. Use a full screen image instead.<br><br>5) Your Terms of Service as completely laughable. Leave them out.<br><br>6) Never, ever refer to yourself as "Tricrokra", and you will probably want to leave out your full name (instead only leaving the name of your company) as well.<br><br>7) The loading screen is big, bloated and uninteresting, and the splash screen at the start containing text should definitely not be there.<br><br>8) The game doesn't instantly hook the player, mostly because the game board is WAY too big. The board shouldn't even be that big on any insane difficulty mode. It should start out at about 4x4 and then work up.<br><br>9) You don't state your price from within the game.<br><br>10) You don't push the full version at all - you don't state its benefits, and that is what you are selling.<br><br>12) There is no purchase option, only a link to your web site.<br><br>13) Your web site is extremely cumbersome to navigate.<br><br>14) There is no score, or sense of reward on completing a level or any small tasks. This is IMPERATIVE to making a puzzle game enjoyable.<br><br>15) The sound effects are completely and utterly pathetic. I would definitely turn them off - but then the game would be soundless!<br><br>16) The download size is excessive to say the least. It's bigger than my <a href="http://www.mking.com/juno/" target="_blank">Juno Nemesis</a>, which contains lots of sound effects, music, graphics etc. ~2.5mb isn't *bad*, but I can hardly see why it has to be as big as it is.<br><br>17) The game isn't difficult enough at the start - and it doesn't accelerate in difficulty nearly fast enough to compensate for good players.<br><br>18) The game flat out crashes when you run it from the link on the desktop.<br><br>19) You haven't gotten a proper icon for your game - it *really* doesn't suit it.<br><br>20) You shouldn't use a password system for saving games. People that forget their passwords or lose them will lose all incentive to play. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

While Quake3 is impressive, it's clearly not yours.

Nothing related to BrickyPlay may be sold, without Tricrokra's permission. (Under selling I do not only count in charge of money. Charging in the form of goods or services is also prohibited). When including the demo version BrickyPlay on a ShareWare CD-ROM, only the costs of creating the CD-ROM may be charged.<br><br>4.<br>Translations.<br>In the LANG\ directory of BrickyPlay you can see the Language files. You are free to use those files to translate the game in your language, and you are free to distrubute those translated files, as long as no form of charge (as described in paragraph 3) is in order. <br><br>5.<br>Puzzle Editor.<br>People who have the license to run the full version are also licenced to use the puzzle editor. Basically you own copyright to your puzzles however, the puzzles may only be distrubuted free of any form of charge. <br><br>6. <br>Disclaimer<br>I hereby disclaim all sorts of warranties. When any product created by Tricrokra damages your software, hardware or anything else, there's no way to claim it, not even when Tricrokra is aware of the possibilities of such damages. Not agreeing to that rule in any way, makes that running BrickyPlay is strictly forbidden.<br>(I however have taken great care of BrickyPlay. I don't deem any damage possible, and BrickyPlay was scanned for all known virusses before its release).<br><br>7.<br>Nothing of the BrickyPlay package may be modified in any sort of way except for the Language files and of course the puzzles you create yourself using the puzzle editor.<br><br>8.<br>None of the included files may be decoded, decompiled, disssassembeld or whatever.<br><br>9. <br>Tricrokra keeps the right to change these rules or to take in license to use or distrubute this software without obligation to give up reasons for it.<br><br>10.<br>When you don't agree with any of these terms using this software is strictly forbidden and then you are required to remove it immediatly.<br><br><br>And when you do agree I hope you have as much fun playing BrickyPlay as I had creating it for you ;)<br> <br></div><br>I didn't intend to blurt out laughing, but needless to say it is incoherent and rambling. It doesn't matter if English isn't your first language. Make an effort if you intend to sell it to English speaking people. Find someone or an EULA you can use. This is just rambling and any court would probably let a warez user off on the basis that it's dense and confusing.<br><br>Onto loading the game...<br>It took longer to get into the game than loading Unreal Tournament 2004 -and- playing the level. So you need to do something about that. I took a look inside your source folder and it appears you've packed up your media. Perhaps you're clearing the media after loading each one? if it's  by terabit then there's tips.<br><br>The main menu: butt ugly and without scheme. I suggest that you make it entirely menu driven with large blocky colourful buttons to be used with the mouse. Help screen is unhelpful because it doesn't even tell you how to navigate the help screen let alone anything else. A rethink is needed there.<br><br>It also has a disturbing lack of timing, running too fast or too slow.<br><br>Onto the game...<br><br>Visually I quite liked it. The mandlebrot fractal in the background wasn't too imposing and actually looked rather pleasent. Your control method truely sucks though, with the user having to travel the mouse all the way over to the other side even if they make a mistake. A TERRIBLE control method.<br><br>To fix this, I suggest you have a row and column drag system. This means all the user needs to do is click any row or any column, then hold the mouse down and drag either left or right or up and down. The mouse will lock to that AXIS and then allow free dragging along that axis. It's intuitive and you can pretty much control it with the mouse WITHOUT any of that silly clicking the arrow business.<br><br>Thanks to your current control method, I completely lost the desire to play any further and quit the game.<br><br>I hope you will sum up the points I've made because I know that deep down in here, there IS a GOOD little puzzle game - you do need to make it a lot more friendly to play though. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Shareware games *can* sell with graphics like this, though.<br><br>I used simple graphics on purpose indeed. I don't think a game of this fashion needs more, and for Shareware it all it's needs.<br><br>2) I don't see exactly how you can have load times as long as you do. They should be just about instant, and anything over 3 seconds or so is an annoyance, especially in a game as simple as this.<br><br>That is something I may sort out in updates. The backgrounds are the evil ones here. The encryption engine used for that isn't that fast. I'm considering to try it out with Terabit's packer.<br><br>3) The menu has keyboard control while the game uses mouse control.<br><br>Good one. I mustn't be so damn lazy. I'll fix that up.<br><br>4) The background in the menu is completely and utterly annoying. Use a full screen image instead.<br><br>Hmmm... That could be an idea, but such images are not my forte, so I solved it this way. I could give it a thought if I can get somebody to design a good picture.<br><br><br>5) Your Terms of Service as completely laughable. Leave them out.<br><br>What exactly is so funny about it.<br><br><br>6) Never, ever refer to yourself as "Tricrokra", and you will probably want to leave out your full name (instead only leaving the name of your company) as well.<br><br>Trust me, I was never intended to explore the internet as "Tricrokra", but that name made me famous (that and much other things). My company name is not fully protected (yet), and therefore I use those names to make sure nobody can ever try to rid my products my stealing my names.<br><br>7) The loading screen is big, bloated and uninteresting, and the splash screen at the start containing text should definitely not be there.<br><br>The loading screen was supposed to be as simple as possible, in order to surpres the loading times. The "splash" screen is more a leftover from debugging routines. I can remove the  text or prevent it from being in the screen too long. The screen itself however is something Blitz does automaticly, so I cannot get rid of it for 100%. 98% should do...<br><br>8) The game doesn't instantly hook the player, mostly because the game board is WAY too big. The board shouldn't even be that big on any insane difficulty mode. It should start out at about 4x4 and then work up.<br><br>That's exactly the opposite from the criticism I got from the 1.0 version (never released and written in the good old DOS era). There I got the criticism that the boards were way to small. I had to pick a size to work with in the end, because the size is always to be put into discussion.<br><br>9) You don't state your price from within the game.<br><br>That's because the price is not yet decided. That will be done once the actual full version is released, but for that I need to get the transaction partners in order.<br><br>10) You don't push the full version at all - you don't state its benefits, and that is what you are selling.<br><br>I should check out the site for that once again.<br><br>12) There is no purchase option, only a link to your web site.<br><br>Will be there once the full version is released (when I have a good transaction partner).<br><br>13) Your web site is extremely cumbersome to navigate.<br><br>The link only leads to a fraction of the website. In fact, I only placed that code there to keep Geocities satisfied. <br><br>14) There is no score, or sense of reward on completing a level or any small tasks. This is IMPERATIVE to making a puzzle game enjoyable.<br><br>I personally didn't think it would suit THIS type of game. And is that the key to make this game enjoyable. In "Lemmings" or "Clockwiser" to name a few commercial puzzle games, I also didn't miss the score. But who is me. You're not the first to suggest this.<br><br>15) The sound effects are completely and utterly pathetic. I would definitely turn them off - but then the game would be soundless!<br><br>Do you know a place when I can find better ones?<br><br>16) The download size is excessive to say the least. It's bigger than my Juno Nemesis, which contains lots of sound effects, music, graphics etc. ~2.5mb isn't *bad*, but I can hardly see why it has to be as big as it is.<br><br>I don't know where the evil one lie to make the size *big*, as I have written more complex games with smaller sizes. But I do think the size is acceptable.<br><br>17) The game isn't difficult enough at the start - and it doesn't accelerate in difficulty nearly fast enough to compensate for good players.<br><br>I wanted to start as easy as possible, to get people to know the rules of the game. Balancing out the difficulty is always hard, but there are some hard ones in there, trust me.<br><br>18) The game flat out crashes when you run it from the link on the desktop.<br><br>It does? Strange. I'll try to find out how that happens.<br><br>19) You haven't gotten a proper icon for your game - it *really* doesn't suit it.<br><br>Ideas for a better one?<br><br>20) You shouldn't use a password system for saving games. People that forget their passwords or lose them will lose all incentive to play.<br><br>Okay, savegames a better idea then? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So you need to do something about that. I took a look inside your source folder and it appears you've packed up your media. Perhaps you're clearing the media after loading each one? if it's by terabit then there's tips. <br></div><br><br>None of terabit's routines have been used, but I am considering it. The base is the same though. The temp files are removed after EVERYTHING is loaded. I hope Terabit's can make this faster, but the main reason for me not to use Terabit's packer was because it misses vital featues. At least for me.<br><br><div class="quote"> Visually I quite liked it. The mandlebrot fractal in the background wasn't too imposing and actually looked rather pleasent. Your control method truely sucks though, with the user having to travel the mouse all the way over to the other side even if they make a mistake. A TERRIBLE control method. <br></div><br><br>Drag &amp; drop? Hmmm, I gotta say that method has never been used before by me in any production (never needed it so far), but I'll take it into consideration.<br><br><div class="quote"> I hope you will sum up the points I've made because I know that deep down in here, there IS a GOOD little puzzle game - you do need to make it a lot more friendly to play though. <br></div><br>I'm glad you see it that way. I'll try add a friendlier method of controlling, next to the controls it already has.<br>I have a few ideas, but I need to see how to work them out.<br><br><div class="quote"> I'd rather you changed them to something more suitable. A game with no sound is as bad as a game with poor sound.  <br></div><br>Suggetions where I can get better? <br><br><div class="quote"> I don't really disagree with anything Michael has said, except maybe number 20. I kind of like password systems myself. But to single out one point he made regarding the terms of service. I didn't read it all (who does?), but I have to say that the first page (the one with your date of birth and everything on) did bring a smile to my face. Nobody cares where and when you were born!  <br></div><br>My birthplace was merely put in there because I found out that there are people having EXACT the same name as I do, and spelled the same (I mean my real name, not "Tricrokra"), this was the only way to make sure we got the right person. It was a silly method, but it should work.<br><br><div class="quote"> Something like this would suit you better.

I kind of like password systems myself.<br> <br></div>That's personal. The chose for passwords or savegames is for me always pending on the type of game. I'm normally not fond of passwords myself, but I found it better for this game. For "The Fairy Tale" I would DEFINATELY not use passwords (that's an RPG, in case you didn't know).<br><br><br><div class="quote"> Nice constructive reply GFK, I hope he uses that EULA.
