They are trying to claim ownership of something that can't be copyrighted.  Since it can't be copyrighted, they will never sue you for copyright.

(Page 7, Heading "Copyright Registration", Paragraph 3.) <br></div> There's no stooping here... your quote is not complete.  While technically you are correct in that the work needs to be registered in order to bring an infringement suit, registration can actually be done at ANY time.  This includes after the infringement actually takes place.  The wording in the actual law is thus <i>"no civil action for infringement of the copyright in any United States work shall be instituted until preregistration or registration of the copyright claim has been made in accordance with this title"</i><br><br>As I said above, a persons work is under copyright protection once that work is put to permanent form.  Now, there are big advantages to copyright registration in a timely manner and before infringement... the first is that one can sue for statutory damages and attorney fees.  you can only sue for actual damages if registration occurs after infringement.  Further more, registration *already proves* that copyright protection was put in place by the date indicated. proof of ownership is also very handy when a cease and desist letter is issued on the owner's behalf. but the point is, even without preregistration you WILL be able to protect your work through litigation and possibly collect actual damages.<br><br>that's very important... think about it, a magazine author or blog author is not going to register each one of their articles.  that does not mean, someone can copy them. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
