Nice moody graphics &amp; style.  I agree the controls are very unintuative and the turret control is too drifty for precision shooting.  As controlling the tank is the main part of the game it really needs some work. <br><br>What would make more sense in the control is that you move forward in the direction the turret is pointing, maybe with 30 degree tollerance   .. e.g. the chassis turns to meet it's general direction and when the angle difference is below some threshold goes in that direction.  I think it's unlikely you'll not want to be looking where you're going, unless reversing - could be a nightmare with alot going on.<br><br>Stevie <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
