I found the first one a bit simple (though enjoyable), but things really take off in the next two.  Plus it's a good set of stories with interesting characters.  If you like atypical, thought-provoking fantasy/SF, then you should like this series. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I agree with you about the value of "oracles", Mr. P (I sometimes find the runes helpful, myself).

You should be able to scale among 100%, 125%, and 150% with main +/-, keypad +/-, and PageUp/PageDn.  If you scale larger than your desktop size, the window will be cropped, but it shouldn't crash.

Once I saw that it was a pretty decent hack, I thought that other fans might enjoy it.<br><br>As it happens, I just finished submitting it to the two websites mentioned earlier, so feel free to send it to your friends.  As for official interest - my only thought there is that I hope I don't get one of those "cease and desist"s that fan creations sometimes do... :)  Hopefully Mr. Pullman will like it if he ever happens to see it, and the lawyers can stay out of it.<br><br>Heh, I know what you mean about getting suggestions after a release :).  But I'm used to it, and yours are decent ones.  <br><br>I like the tooltips one - that'd be a handy way to view the meanings.<br><br>I'm not sure about turning the hands by direct dragging (not for the technical difficulty, but because IIRC that's not how they work in the book :) ).  It might be a useful alternative, though.<br><br>Another thing that I'm half-considering is making the symbol file user-editable and extendable.  That way, you could add your own, personal meanings to the symbols (though the needle might need to speed up if it could potentially go around a dozen times for the 12th meaning, etc.).  While I'm at it, I guess I could open up <i>all</i> the files, so that you could use your own, customized background and hands.  But that's really going out there and would require installers to set up the various folder(s)/files (right now everything is neatly moleboxed or incbin-ed).<br><br>We'll see.  This was originally just intended as a brief diversion from more "serious" game creation (where I <i>do</i> try to anticipate player needs and build in expansion capability for future features).  But maybe there'll be more to do with this alethiometer than I initially intended (which would be appropriate :) ). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
