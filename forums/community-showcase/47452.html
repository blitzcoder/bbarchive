Sounds are bad and dull. The game goes too fast and I couldn't really play it because of that. Collisions with the walls are awful and VERY annoying, the cart just stops or slows down too much. The gameplay is bad as the cart doesn't feel like a car(t). You should at least do somekind of basic physics modelling. That would help a lot.<br><br>Just honest opinions. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Basically, you should either decrease the speed of driving or increase the speed of turnning of camera and kart. Maybe even put the camera to be firmly fixed towards the kart, not smoothened like it is now.<br><br>No kart engine noises?<br><br>Some trackside objects would do, even simple cubes with stuff on them, maybe?<br><br>Its great that you made it this far, and you did more and better than a very large majority of blitzers did. It's always nice to improve tho, so maybe you can make it a better next version. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You can pick up (and use) a shield, smoke generator and the wheel blades and then a laser but not if you had the laser first. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The camera follows the kart a bit faster now. I agree that there need to be more objects around the track, and maybe some background music. The ballon should perhaps not fly that high, and you should probably be able to pick up powerups when you have a laser or a mini gun as Perturbatio suggested.<br>Anyway try the new demo, to see if it is easier/better to play. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You should allow the player to run off the track slightly - maybe half a track width, before they hit any barrier.  Obviously going off the track should slow the player down.<br><br>In all fairness, I didn't like Mario Kart either, and Mario Kart-a-likes really aren't my bag. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The presentation is top-drawer but it is let down by how incredibily difficult it is to control the kart - there's no physics (at least I didn't notice any) to give any feedback to the driver and steering is a nightmare - I found myself travelling the wrong way all the time - I think its been mentioned that you cant do a 180 without colliding with the barriers.<br>If you moved the barriers out a little as GFK suggested this might help. Make the steering a little more user friendly too.<br>I must stress that I only played using the keyboard so it may be that with a gamepad its different.<br>With the control issues resolved I think you would have a mighty fine little game there ! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It has a lot of potential. What I think would be cool is to add different engine speeds ala MarioKart. I found the controls a little over sensitive but if you play it for a bit you soon get used to how the karts handle. I would love for there to be engine sounds. No racing sim is complete without engine sounds.<br><br>Overall I liked it. Good work.<br><br>:) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I think a lot of it has to do with the speed of the game itself.<br><br>The game does not need to be so fast, slow it down and give players the chance to play the game with the other competitors not racing off too quickly making it seem like an impossible task.  Taking part is not fun at the moment.<br><br>Developing a game is an organic process, with iterations - each getting tighter, better and more enjoyable... this game is no different.  Just now it needs more iterations, tweaks, additions, balancing and it will be GREAT!<br><br>You need to get the controls working far more in the player's favour... at the moment they feel out of control, which is unfair.  Give players the control to keep their kart on the track and able to compete with the computer karts, as that is a major part of a racing game!  At the minute it feels very unfair, players are fighting with the control system which is wrong.  BUT there's nothing to prevent you from adjusting it to improve it enough to make the potential of this game emerge.<br><br>Introduce kart engine sounds, get some bouncy music in there and more sound effects, on the buttons and everywhere.<br><br>Amon and Smiff are both right - the potential for this game is there - it could be a FAB game if you can get the balance of the gameplay right.<br><br>I love the track designs and colours, I think the graphics style is fine, I just want the game to emerge from what looks like a project which has been a long time in the making.<br><br>KEEP IT UP Jeppe!

At slow speeds, steering should be fast. At increasingly higher speeds, steering rate should decrease. Another thing which would perhaps make the driving a bit more realistic is to use lower acceleration. Of course you are aiming at a fun racer, but even then it's important to get a driving feel. In this respect I like the original Mario Kart on the snes, it is fun (throwing bananas etc) but also a real racer, screeching down the track at top speed and throwing the kart into a corner while skidding (at the same time trying to avoid the banana).<br><br>Still, it looks great.<br><br>Oh yes, another thing which would make driving more realistic/fun is a bit of skidding! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I got few comments..<br>-You should make the car control easier, specially when turning left or right, I think by making better/easier car control can make the player enjoy picking power-ups or attack other players, instead concentrating controlling the car ( which is frustrating)<br>- Music is ok, SFX need improvement.<br>- GUI need to be more interactive, i.e. animated buttons and mouse cursor<br>thanks<br>&lt;EDIT&gt; you can learn more about car control by playing similar games <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
