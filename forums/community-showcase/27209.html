And in the next version of XP (It MIGHT be in MCE for that matter), the .NET runtimes will be included with the OS.  At the latest, they will be included with the OS by next year.  And I *think* they are included in SP1 for XP now.  Certainly they will be included with SP2.  So you are going to get them irregardless of whether you WANT them or not if you are running XP.  <br><br>"Bloat because you can" mentality comes from a lot of things.  Compilers that no longer optimize size as well as they should...  Blitz includes a whole crapload of "runtime" in it that isn't needed.  Good lord!  1.8 meg for a 20 line program?  Outrageous.  Frankly, I couldn't care less.  Any recent (within the last 3 years) system is going to have enough disk space that a few extra meg here and there is immaterial.  And any modern game is going to have 50x more disk-space requirements for it's media than the executable and runtimes.  It seems to me that Ultraedit's install is around 14 meg (I might be wrong, but that's what I recollect).  And that's not even a .net app.  And it does less than protean does in some areas.  <br><br>Some people just need to crawl out of 1987 when the largest program out there was Willy Beamish on what?  7 floppies?

If anyone hasn't noticed runtime "bloat" has been increasing at an exponential rate for some time now.

If you don't like the program they created, you don't have to buy it, thats how the free market works. So I don't see why anyone would even waste their time arguing about something thats full of "bloat" when they aren't even going to use it. I'm only even writing this because it seems that arguments of this type are getting somewhat prevalent on these forums. <br><br>Hell, if someone releases something for a price and you don't like it, big deal, don't buy it. If it's for free and you don't like it, don't use it, or if the author was nice enough to provide the source, change it. <br><br>As far as people wanting free software, I'm one of them and I'm proud of it, I will and do pay for software if I feel it's worth it and I can't find a simpler solution for what I want to do or am unable to do it myself. Another thing to consider, some people have no choice but to want free software due to their financial status.

I fear the you may be very very narrow minded when it comes to the current state of affairs in the linux world, and the whole IT industry as a whole. I feel obligated to inform you that your "ideas" about the propagation of linux in the IT industry are a bit faded and old.

I alos realize that this information shows very diffrent market segments, but its this diversity that makes linux a powerhouse. I will admit that Linux is not for everyone, but it gets better every week, which is more then I can say for windows. Feel free t email me at the address listed below and I would be more then happy to talk with you, or you can visit me on irc at, irc.blitzed.org, channels #blitzbasic, #blitzcoder, #binarypeople. There are also a few other people there that would be more then happy to enlighten you. I didnt write this to be mean, but a large amount of windows users have had never tried linux or they had a bad experience with it. But they forget the frustration they had when they first used windows, all it is is a learning curve. Have a nice day. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It also gets more unstable.  I have LITERALLY booted into some debian iteration and had it lock up totally upon doing nothing but clicking the "start" button in KDE.  I have seen similar crashes in other x-win stuff.  <br><br>Which brings up another problem with linux.  Standardization.  The only thing that's "standard" with linux is the kernel.  And even that can be tweaked and modified by the end-user if they really want to do so.  Each distro of linux is different and not even the executables are totally compatible with different flavors.  You might have to recompile a program to work on your particular version of linux.  That is a LONG way from being user friendly enough for the average home user.<br><br>Drivers.  LOOONG have drivers been a thorn in the side of the linux community.  Go grab a driver if one is available and you might have to tweak a half dozen different text files in order to get it to work the way it should.  RPMs go quite a ways to simplifying this, but you STILL might have to tweak those text files.  And that's only if you can get a driver for your particular device.  You MIGHT have to go attempt (no guarantees) to find some open source driver that may or may not work.  And certainly isn't supported by the manufacturer.  It took YEARS for the linux kernel to even support USB after it became standard in Windows.  That was sad indeed for proponents of linux.  "Will my flatbed scanner work in linux?"  "um.  No.  Nothing USB will work."<br><br>Linux is indeed getting better.  But it has enough drawbacks that it's got a number of years to go before it reaches desktop usability for the vast majority of non-computer literate drones...<br><br>Kanati <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
