There should be a fun mode.  Basically, it will be an easter egg that creates crazy stunts for you.<br><br>Set it for yourself versus an unsuspecting friend in 2 player mode.  Then, start missing shots left and right as your friend is about to win.  When you get your 'last chance', you open the english screen and click the dot in a special order, that actually triggers an easter egg without your friend realizing it.  Next, right as you shoot, the stick is corrected to be perfect (and the friend will think you were the one who moved it), then shot, and creates a crazy chain reaction that lands all the balls in :)  Where the balls do some crazy physics to make it happen, of course, but it will be fun with a lot of acting by the player about how he didn't expect that to happen :)<br><br>Another feature would be a Stress-Test mode.  Have the computer player do the kinds of shots that at first look like he missed.  This will make one start laughing, until they realize the ball kept moving and hit three or four of his balls and they went in.  Oh, and when YOU are the one shooting, have the balls do weird stuff like slip out of the pocket at the last second, or have balls fly off the table, and when you think you are about to win, if you miss, have the computer shoot every single ball in and finish it off. :)  Just a crazy and very stressful mode.  The review sites will find it hillarious and will say, 'hmm, that might actually be useful for a real tourney player'.  And then you get that quote, that it would be really useful for a tourney player, and you're all set !   :)<br><br>There should also be a 2D mode like Yahoo pool.  Did you use takoma physics engine?

Did you use takoma physics engine? I like the game very much! <br></div><br><br>There is a 2d mode like Yahoo pool. If you select manual camera in game options and press F12 to switch to top down view only, it's exactly like Yahoo pool.<br><br>No, I didn't use Tokamak or any physics engine. I wrote all the physics myself.<br><br><br>I may schedule another MP test night later this week if I can't find the problem in the meantime. I had another test last night and there is definitely an occasional problem, but I can't see any logical reason why it would happen. Must be some packet loss issue I haven't accounted for. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I started with a cubemap and then used a little program I found somewhere ( maybe on the Unwrap3d.com site? ) to convert cubemaps to spheremaps. <br><br><br><div class="quote"> <br>wanna see swerve shots and screw shots too. <br><br>In fact , the ability to strike the ball anywhere to impart the appropriate spin would be cool. <br><br>suppose that would create a bit of a headache though <br> <br></div><br><br>Sctew shots ( aka spin, english ) are already implemented in a basic fashion. Hold E and move the mouse to choose where the cue will hit the cue ball. <br><br>I don't know how hard spin would be to implement. My physics code is very neat and readable, so if there are good references online, probably not too hard. It was never my intention to make that kind of game though. There are already commercial games out there which have wrapped up the ultra-realistic market. I wanted my game to bridge the gap between Yahoo Pool and those commercial games. Easy to pickup and play, lots of fun, addictive, nothing complex like jumps and swerves and bouncing off the table to worry about, but better graphics, better physics and generally more polished than Yahoo Pool ( which is insanely popular but a bit rubbish. )<br><br>Basically, I wanted to write a pool game I'd enjoy playing. I find Yahoo too basic and unrealistic, but I find Cueball World and recent Virtual Pool outings too intricate and it's far too easy to lift the ball right off the table. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Blitz seems to be a bit weird in Windowed mode ( which is why I usually avoid it, but it seemed useful for this game ) and the menus slide in from offscreen at the beginning. If the window does not have focus or if you drag the window even slightly while the menu is sliding in, it will stop the movement from happening. Haven't figured out why yet, let alone worked out a solution, but avoid letting the window lose focus or moving it while the menus are open. It shouldn't happen at all in fullscreen mode ( though you actually need to see the menus to enable fullscreen mode. )<br><br><br><div class="quote"> Only problem I had was I could not see my shot take place in action after I hit the cue ball.

There are a few zbuffer quirks, most of which don't seem to be important. It could be a driver issue since most GF4TI's seem to have no such problem, but I will see what more I can do to optimize Z-buffer usage. Also, try 32 bit fullscreen and see if that helps. ) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
