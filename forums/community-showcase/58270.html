It really isn't a problem - even if we could somehow translate BlitzMax code to Java it would take forever to cut the game down to mobile phone size anyway. The mob version will be VERY basic.<br><br>Quicksilver:<br>As for problems with BlitzMax, well you might find like to know that when I started Inca it was early beta, nearly a year before release, so I had plenty of problems. It didn't have EachIn or Include and SetColor took a TColor (module doesn't exist anymore). There are a few gems in the Inca source. When the beta broke array allocation, and I wanted to do this:<br><br><pre class=code>Levels = New Int[ 10 ]</pre><br><br>It would give a parser error... so for a while there was a much more offensive version of this there as a workaround:<br><br><pre class=code>Local StupidBlitzMax[ 10 ]
Levels = StupidBlitzMax</pre><br><br>The real problems that someone starting today would go through are:<br><br>1) Sound - need an FMod or equiv driver<br>2) Mouse lag<br><br>Fixing those wasn't hard. The only problem that I think remains is the video memory usage, it's not efficient - exactly one 1024x1024 texture per 640x480, and there are a lot of full screen images. I would like to see that improved with some kind of a packing algorithm, you could at least halve the memory usage of those screens.<br><br>Plus, there are still crashes on some computers. And no software mode of course. But I think in this day and age, the compatability isn't too bad (no software would have been terrible a few years ago).<br><br>The hard part of all of this will be creating something good - if you can do that the rest will follow. You can sort the kinks out for the PC release and your publisher will pay for any porting (mobile, xbox 360 etc). BlitzMax isn't a bad choice to create something good - if you can do it and are determined to, it won't hold you back. If you can't nothing will help you enough. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I've played Bust-a-move 4 to death on the Dreamcast and a version of it on my phone quite recently but it still managed to bring something a little fresh to it that kept me playing it.<br><br>There's the different styles of combos (especially with the rebound thing where the balls head upwards after you match them to combo with other sets, which tbh, I didn't completely understand on my first go), the whole 'swap' thing which isn't in Bust-a-move (as far as 4 goes anyway), and the different powered bubbles. I don't think it actually is a done to death genre if you actually look around. Maybe you could call it a 'match-three' game to put it in that pigeon hole but nah, the gameplay isn't quite that static. Plus the little bonus Parachute-esque game adds something different, with all of this within the first 15 minutes of playing the game. The level of polish and presentation is a bonus yeh, but it's sort of a requirement for it to get on to the Yahoo! rostrum. You can't just dismiss the main game as tosh because on the surface it is a remake of another game...<br><br>But then again, it's only Amon saying that, so I guess there's no trouble here... ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
