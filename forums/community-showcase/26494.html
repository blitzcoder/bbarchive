Even Red Faction 2 (PS2 oriented from the beginning) have worse texture than the first one for PC. I also started to think that in some way the standard set for the PS2 reduced the quality of PC games, at least for the economical and time-wise interest of keeping a PC conversion to console limits.<br><br><div class="quote"> Don't forget these are tiled textures.I have tried them all at 256 and 128 in blitz and they look fine close up.  <br></div><br>I would be way more interested in having also to have a full set of unique textures - as your doors for example - rather than only rock/grass/etc. ones, and not tileable textures are the ones which would be better to have at a higher res. I agree that for tileable ones 256x256 with multitexturing is often *still* fine even for high-detail stuff though.<br><br><div class="quote"> he he its easier to create 256's then 512's though, you need way more detail.  <br></div><br>I take your point, though there is a reason because you don't see a lot of high-quality textures packages around. :)<br><br>Anyway, good stuff Ruz: I suppose that high-res versions for 'unique tiles' and mostly 256x256 for tileable textures would do the trick for a basic package.
