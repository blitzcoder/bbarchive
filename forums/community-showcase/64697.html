This issue has been fixed.<br>+ Miscellaneous cosmetic re-touch<br><br>Now I need some suggestions about the following topics:<br>? Is the game too easy or too hard to master ?<br>? Gives the game fun or is it boring ?<br>? Is the game too fast/too slow ?<br><br>For the Robots behaviour, I've thought the following:<br>1) they should damage the astroship<br>2) when a robots is destroyed by the player, it should release an Energy Bonus<br>3) if a robots is not destroyed, and enter in its self-destroying mode, then the robot explosion should damage the Astroship.<br><br>What do you think about this concept ?<br><br>New "weapons" are also under developing, and will be probably activated in the next version, as well as the suggested "wrapping line" which will also be a container for a new energy bar.<br><br>Thanks for your attention,<br>Sergio. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
