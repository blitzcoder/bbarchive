Lets not be sexist) in my view.<br><br>If we are blunt, portals will probably not take up PPB, I've been there and its a git when the 'we are declining your game' emails start rolling, so without them, where do you stand, well, unless your marketing skills are above and beyond your average developer, you stand pretty much in the middle of nowhere, because:-<br><br>- It takes a lot of time to get your game out there, to the masses, you have to cover a lot of area, you need to put in a good few hours hammering sites and its a very labouring monotonous process, and sadly, if you match up sales to the work that goes in, your gonna lose.<br><br>- There are pong clones kicking around all over the shop, from funky full downloads to in-browser affairs, so in reality, your game will have to be super duper good for anyone away from these programming walls to take yours instead.<br><br>So, taken into consideration about everything, my advice is to not rush into releasing it commercially, but take your time, if it was me, I'd buy a domain called PingPongBattle, glitz up a page and provide a 'full' version with a $1 minimum donate button that allows people who have donated access to some extra snazzy content, like extra characters, access to a online high-score table, even online play. [I wish I did, lol]<br><br>As I said, I do like the game, and I hope I havent put a downer on anything because I dont intend that, but, if you do continue to publish it on your own, then I'll be the first to say good luck, as I know you've worked a lot on this! :)<br><br>Dabz <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Here, you don't have paddles, but characters, and they are not<br>restricted to moving just up and down, but all over the field depending on what<br>powerups\special abilities they use. There are often more than one ball flying around,<br>and with all the powerups, standard attacks, and special attacks, the game often<br>becomes much more about those while blocking the ball takes a back seat.<br><br>I have tournament modes, Vs mode, stage select, and a story.<br><br>Now if someone would please answer, how the heck does that become a pong clone?<br>(Sorry about the slight rant, it just annoys me ;)<br><br><br><div class="quote">  So, taken into consideration about everything, my advice is to not rush into releasing it commercially, but take your time, if it was me, I'd buy a domain called PingPongBattle, glitz up a page and provide a 'full' version with a $1 minimum donate button that allows people who have donated access to some extra snazzy content, like extra characters, access to a online high-score table, even online play.

Unfortunately many people now judge games on graphics (too many people expect 3d stuff or hd everything) more than gameplay or effort put in to the actual game, not just the graphics.  I wish you the best luck but it just doesnt seem to meet what the market is after these days... I fear that many 2d games miss out simply because they are 2d, many of my friends actually refuse to buy any 2d games because they consider them outdated even if they are recent games.  I guess I am beating around the bush telling you that you game simply wont be a top seller, you may sell 10 copies or even 100, I have no idea and it really depends on your marketing skills but unfortunately the people buying games are really shallow (judging by whats on the surface - graphics)  Its a good game but trying to put it up there with the big guys (commercial games) is a bit of a leap if you ask me.  Good luck in whatever you try to do and I hope this wasnt demotivational, you are one of few people that can actually finish a good game around here :)<br><br>^^^<br>based on my opinion and experience however limited and sheltered it may be <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
