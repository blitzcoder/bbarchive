However, some people find this unintuitive.<br><br>Right now we're thinking WASD for pitch/turn and Space for boost, J for stabilize, K for bomb, and L for camera.

We want to know what others are mapping their controls too.  We're having a debate.  I think the controls suit the game.  As the character in the jetpack has one hand on each control so does the actual user.  Still if you don't like it you can re - map it.<br><br>I mean we're talking about hardcoding the cursors for movement and then allowing for optional pitch/turn to be mapped by default to WASD and then be able to be changed to whatever, but the cursors will then be hogged, so someone who likes the default controls (me) wouldn't be able to use them.  But at least the default settins would allow cursors or WASD for turn/pitch.<br><br>I think that someone who doesn't find the game premise interesting enough to re - map the controls to suit themself would never click the Buy Now! button anyway.

Pilotwings uses the same control mechanic.  <br><br>If I pick up a few users that would be good as well.  You can't please everyone, I'm really sorry that you can't come to grips with the control.  <br><br>Think about this, Halo has sold about 3 million copies and I had a debate with quite a few  Blitz users as to whether that was a good game.  A lot of people disagreed with me on that too, yet that game has it's niche just like AA will.  <br><br>Thinking about this I feel comfortable making the above assumption.  Not everyone's going to like the game, but the people that do will change the control to suit their needs and they will enjoy it.<br><br>Selling software like this is a numbers game.  No one selling shareware gets a super huge purchase to download ratio.  It stays right at about 1 - 2%.  If I don't get that then I'll have to reconsider the play mechanics more.  So far all is well though. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I started playing with that new control scheme and it made the game difficult for me to play.  It made me feel like I was just learning to play for the first time.<br><br>The problem with the game is that the jets pitch too slow.  I remember when comparing it to Pilotwings that they turned slower but it seemed to be a non-issue at the time.  I have uploaded a new demo and they pitch faster.  The result is maybe what you were talking about.  If you're not holding forward or back you go up.  If you hit forward you get almost instant forward motion instead of moving up a lot before getting the effects of the jets in a forward motion.  Please check this out.  It's probably not the best fix but I think it helps. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I would suggest that you limit the rotation of the thruster so that when it is completely forward it thrusts up just enough to fight gravity (ie not a straight 90 degrees).<br><br>Of course, the controls could still be improved a *lot*, but this is definitely a step in the right direction. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I think it rotates at a good speed so you don't fall too quick when you try to go forward but you also don't go straight up because the jet's don't react fast enough.  It's more balanced now and I won't have to change the entire game.  I have play mechanic called the juggle ball which requires you to fall with the ball while boosting forward to complete goals.  It wouldn't work properly without the falling you get after a while.  But now at least you don't begin to sink right away.<br><br>Thanks Michael! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

When I continue rotating clockwise it also returns to normal when passing the 90 degree border. So between 0 and 90 degrees the textures are not displayed.
