Right click selects weapons.  (Most weapons are test code, so they don't work right.  Use the lasers to kill the aliens.)  Middle click spawns aliens.<br><br>Spacebar switches levels.  You can now see a bunch of the planets.  Work on those is still ongoing, so I'll be fixing them up a bit and adding atmspheres and shadows and things that might be missing.  <br><br>The levels will have something like three parts flying through space and then a couple sections with the planet.  But right now you only see the planets except on those levels where the planet image is missing and then you get to see the flying through space thing.<br><br>There's some neat particle effects when the various types of enemy bullet hit you, but the egg splat and sound need work, and there's no sound for when the purple psychic waves hit you.<br><br>You can now move the ship around freely.<br><br>When you shoot enemies they will spawn powerups.  Right now every kill will spawn one.  <br><br>I'm probably going to make the powerups still images because we made a few mistakes making the animations and there's not enough frames and some speed up and slow down as they rotate.  I'll add sparkles and make them glow.  It'll still look good.  The aritst lost a bunch of the models in a hard drive crash so he probably couldn't rerender them without redoing them and I'm not gonna have him do that just for a spinning animation.<br><br>If you look at the stars you'll notice they sparkle now.  And they're drawn behind the nebula/space dust which uses alpha so it looks nicer.  And when the enemies spawn initially they're behind the nebula.  I changed this cause I noticed when the stars sparkled while you flew through space it suddenly because really obvious they weren't behind the nebula.  They looked like snow instead of stars.  So changing the draw order solved that issue.  I just hope using a big alpha object like that won't slow the game down too much on low end systems.<br><br>You can press tab to see the fps, but it won't exceed the monitor's refresh rate.<br><br>Anyway lemme know what you think. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

With masking, a pixel is either on or off.  <br><br>But I hired an artist who rendered all the characters in 3D studio Max, and BlitzMax uses 3D acceleration.  <br><br>So the artist rendered each character with an alpha map that specifies how transparent each pixel is around the edge of the character.  That means the pixels in the character don't have ot be on or off, they could be 50% transparent.  And varying the transparency allows you to get smoother edges.  And BlitzMax, being 3D accelerated, allowed me to display these images with this antialiasing just as fast as they would be displayed in a 2D game without it.<br><br>If you imagine drawing a circle over a grid, then if you just colored in each pixel that the circle passed through it would look blocky.  But if you colored each pixel by the amount of the circle which was covering that pixel, then you would get a smooth looking circle.

For simple animation like this, it would probably be a lot easier to just move some vertcies and have two morph objects, and then have the program morph back and forth between them.  But that would not have allowed certain things like wings to avoid being distorted, so either he animated those seperatey, or he used bones for the whole thing.<br><br>Anyway, I don't think you understand how bones work.  <br><br>A bone is not for moving an object.  A bone is for moving the vertices in the object.  So if you put one bone in a character's arm, you would weight all the vertcies for the lower part of the arm for that bone, and them gradually reduce the vertex weights up at the shoulder.  Then when you  rotate the bone the arm would rotate, and the vertcies near the shoulder would rotate less so that you get a smooth transition into the non-rotating chest there.<br><br>That's what he would have done here for many of the characters, if he used bones.<br><br>Oh and you might be wondering about the squash/stretch.  That too can be done with bones.  If you just stick a bone in the middle of the model and weight all the vertices to it to some degree, then when you scale the bone vertically the whole model will squash vertically.  Of course you could do that same effect just by animating the model's vertical scale.  <br><br>But that's where the vertex weighting comes in.  The red bouncing alien with one eye for example... His eye and head doesn't deform as his lower half squashes and stretches.  So that was either done with a bone, or the artist moved the vertices manually to make a morph object. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I can have a screen full of enemies and still dodge every bullet and diving enemy!<br><br><br>As for repeat firing, I'm not sure that would work so well.  If I had a slow repeat rate to mimic the speed at which you can press the button, you'd miss a lot of enemies when they fly by.  And if I had a fast repeat rate, then it would be much too easy to kill the enemies.  This is not a fast paced shooter with hundreds of bullets on the screen at once.<br><br>That said, I'll consider it.  I'm sure just as many people would request that as requested that the ship be able to move freely about instead of being limited to the bottom of the screen.  <br><br>But just because a lot of people ask for a certain feature doesn't mean it's a good thing to add.  Something like that can change the whole feel, balance, and difficulty level of the game.  I think Platypus has continuous fire, and as a result, every enemy takes hundreds of hits to kill, and you have tons of bullets flying on the screen at once. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There's only so many ways that you can punish a player, and punishments are what create the risk in a game.  <br><br>In super-gerball, the punishment for falling off a ledge is being forced to restart the level from the beginning.  If someone requested that you be able to save in the middle of a level because having to restart it from the beginning was annoying, or that your ball be placed back at the point where it fell off, would you implement that, knowing that now you've greatly diluted the risk factor, and the player won't be nearly as concerned about falling off the edges?<br><br>Taking the "lazy" way out is exactly what makes a game like super-gerball fun.  It makes the game difficult, and if the levels are designed well, then the player always feels they are at grave risk, (because of the treaded annoying punishment of having to restart the level) but still manages to make it through about half the time.<br><br>Reversed controls ARE "annoying".  But that's what makes them a good punishment.  And if I don't have the powerup that reverses the controls appear very often, and I limit the amount of time that the controls are reversed to a few seconds, then I can induce panic in the player that accidentally collects the powerup, without forcing them to play in that manner so long that it becomes irritating and boring.  <br><br>It's just like the flashbangs in counterstrike.  Is it fun to be blinded for 10 seconds?  Hell no.  It it "annoying"?  Yes!  But not so much that I would remove them from the game.  That they are annoying is what induces the panic in you when someone throws one at you, and that panic causes your adrenaline to flow, and that's what makes most games fun.  <br><br>Of course constant adrenaline isn't fun so you have to throw in some rest periods, or else the player will just get fatigued.  But this isn't game design 101. :-)<br><br>In short, if you take all the annoying things out of the game, then you've taken out all the risk, and the risk is what generates most of the reward.  <br><br>You can say "Reversing the player's controls for 30 seconds is annoying." but saying that you should never reverse or take away the player's controls is silly.<br><br>Zelda Ocarina of Time took away your controls completely when one of the zombies screamed at you, and those were one of the scariest and best enemies ever.  So there, you're both wrong! :-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I do want feedback.  And I changed the way the ship moves to reduce the amount of inertia greatly, and to allow it to move freely as a result of feedback.<br><br>But saying that X feature is annoying and you should do it differently is silly.  It's not an absolute.  <br><br>I can say that sticky powerups in arkanoid games I've played haven't been much fun because they just stop the gameplay whenever the ball hits the paddle and stays there, but that doesn't mean it's not possible to implement such a powerup in a way that would be fun.  I know that there have been a lot of reverse control powerups in games that have been done badly.  But I've played games where they were done well, and I think that if implemented sparingly in a limited manner, it can improve the game.  <br><br>You might disagree that that's possible, but you really should wait to see how I've implemented it before making such a determination.  If it's not fun after I've put it in, I'll take it out.  It's not like the game design is set in stone. :-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
