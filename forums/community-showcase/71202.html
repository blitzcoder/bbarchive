I know some of you would expect a w,a,s,d and mouse to shoot setup, I did have this but found that the game was way to easy, something i might look at again in the future tho.<br><br>Anyway. thanks in advance for looking at this. its one of those life long projects you can never seem to finish so would be good to finally get the book closed on it.<br><br>oh and pls don't post about the file size. ;)<br><br>::edit::<br><img src="http://www.coreillusions.co.uk/e107_plugins/autogallery/Gallery/PDS/ScreenShot_007.jpg"> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I love it. The best asteroids game i´ve ever played. but i dont really understand the HUD. the indicates right and left beside the fire-energie indicate.

Some work is required in the gfx, in particular in background. I would like to see some spinning planet, stars, and nebulae for example. I really liked the glove effect you apply to the firing bullets.<br><br>Quite frankly, I'm not a fan of the mouse-driven control; but that's my personal opinion, and perhaps I just have to be accustomized to it. I guess that you can control the ship to move or to fire at the mouse position.<br><br>Note that I'm speaking only about the video here, because the download size has quite scared me :-/<br><br>Which software did you use for videocapture ?<br><br>Regards,<br>Sergio.<br><br>P.S.<br>If you fancy, take a look at my asteroids WIP.

There will be 1up's floating around but yeah you will start with only 1 ship. any more will be gained through a score bonus or one of the mentioned 1up's that you can find.<br><br>As for the hud, I still need to do some help screens but it should be prety self explanatory, your ship bottom left, shows 3 rings around it, these are your sheilds.<br><br>The 3 main powerbars next to your shield are your left,mid and right gun cells, when you start only your middle gun cell will drop in power as you fire. as you power up to shooting two bullets, your left and right cells will degrade and then when your on full gun power shooting 3 bullets all 3 cells will degrade.<br><br>Your power cells can be recharged faster by collecting more batteries, which you will see floating around.<br><br>Quick Tip, any drop with a green indicator is safe. anything with a red one is deadly. an orange one shows items that could help or hinder your progress.<br><br>@Semar : yeah the video is a bit old now, and I agree the one thing I hate the most at the moment are the back grounds, having said that the backgrounds in the demo are better than those in the video, but even saying that they are still not exactly what I want.<br><br>Yeah checked yours out , really cool I love the 2D feel to it. really nice particle and bullet types as well.<br><br>Don't let the download size scare you, its that large because while I am working on a project all media is exposed and in its raw formats, I will compress everything down once Its finished.<br><br><br>Thanks for all your feedback. need more tho.. I will upload some screen shots later I know people avoid downloading stuff unless they can actually see what it is they are downloading. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
