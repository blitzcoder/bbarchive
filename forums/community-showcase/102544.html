Whether blockbuster or trash-tv - you decide what your audience can watch - but if they want it?<br><br><br>Languages: English, German ... language files<br>Website: <a href="http://www.tvgigant.de/en/index" target="_blank">www.tvgigant.de/en/index</a><br>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/GWRon/TVTower" target="_blank">github.com/GWRon/TVTower</a><br>Licence: Open Source, restricted libpng/zlib (no commercial usage without permission)<br><br>-&gt; Instead of just playing, I strongly invite you to join us coding the game, improving basics or extend the abilities of our AI (written in LUA).<br><br><br><br><a href="http://www.tvgigant.de/files/media/screenshots/screen_chef.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.tvgigant.de/files/media/screenshots/resizedheight400/screen_chef.jpg"></a><br><br><br><br><b>Information - What is TVTower?</b><br><br><div class="quote"> If I was head of programming, everything would be better... <br></div><br><br>That is something all of us thought some day when feeling annoyed about the current programme. Now you have got the chance to change it.<br><br>TVTower is kind of a remake to the ancient but still brilliant game MadTV and therefor the concept of our game is closely based on it.<br><br>Within the game multiple players compete in real time against each other. Objective is to manage a tv station. Therefor it is required to place advertisements to finance your programmes and to broadcast movies and news shows to reach a bigger audience. But your rivals never sleep. If you do not pay attention you will rapidly have no great movies, no audience, no money, no future.<br><br>The audience is splitted into target groups/jobs and genders. All of them have different needs regarding the broadcasted programmes. Also they have different times to watch tv.<br><br>So you have to reconsider if broadcasting "Manager today" monday 11am is preferable to "Having fun being unemployed".<br><br>Movies - like already mentioned - are needed to attract audience. But you should be aware what target group you gear towards. So fans of action movies and advertisements for detergents are a rare minority.<br><br>Maybe the movie "Sissi" would fit better.<br><br>Or are series a way better idea?<br><br>Naturally your audience is not interested in watching the same old movies over and over. That is why you need to collect a bigger and bigger getting archive of movies and series. Why? So you can give your programmes a breather. Or is it a better idea to invest in your own productions? And... where to get all the money for this plans?<br><br>For sure, your audience has to stop for a pee - so take the chance to send advertisements. But to have advertisements to send you have to sign some contracts in advance. But you are wrong if you believe that advertisements is a source of never ending money.<br><br>Because the advertisers have nothing to gift and if you are not able to broadcast all needed ad spots within time or with less audience than needed you will have to pay a big penalty instead of creating a nice income.<br><br>One possibility to increase audience is to produce a news show. Theay attract audience and some of them keep watching your channel for the next programme.<br><br>But who is interested in things already happened 5 minutes before?!? The most recent news are important and these are only ... like everything in life - available for a higher price.<br><br>But how to get more money? Logically with a greater audience. This literally cries for expansion. To increase audience reach it is possible t make new broadcasting areas available. The less players are broadcasting in such an area the less players are sharing that audience. So roll up your sleeves and get to work - before the others approach too...<br><br>So, Mister programme director, show us your stuff!<br><br><br><br><a href="http://www.tvgigant.de/files/media/screenshots/screen_hochhaus3.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.tvgigant.de/files/media/screenshots/resizedheight400/screen_hochhaus3.jpg"></a><br><br><br><br>If you watch one of these reboots and remakes of your favorite movies you often ask yourself: "Why all those remakes if there is an original which is much better?". And it is exactly this question which some of you might ask themselves.<br><br>The answer is shockingly easy: Our remake is 1000x besser than the original. And this is because of:<br><br><b>Features</b><br><br>* It is free of costs. Yes, freeware!<br><br>* There is a multiplayer mode. Now you can play with your mates over LAN or internet. Show them how to win.<br><br>* Playable with Windows, Mac and Linux. (currently we only offer executables for Windows and Linux)<br><br>* Higher in-game resolution: instead of 320x200 now 800x600 (more is planned with a different image set). Effects like alpha blending allow smooth shadows and other things for hovering etc.)<br><br>* New music and soundeffects with higher playback quality.<br><br>* All movies, ad contracts, story books, ...are available in an editable text file.<br><br>* The calculation of the audience quotes/ratings is much more realistical than in the original game. <a href="http://www.tvgigant.de/en/pages/features#quotenberechnung" target="_blank">-&gt; Details</a><br><br>* Like in the original there are stations which you have to place to increase the area of broadcasting. Here we use a population density map to rebuild real regions in Germany.<br><br>* Now we broadcast 24 hours a day.<br><br>* The production of shows is more advanced thanin the original game. It is even possible to produce a surprising success. The cast you chose are connected to trends and popularities. You are the forge of stars. (not yet included in game)<br><br>* News agencies provide you with news. Depending on level of abonnement they deliver the news earlier or later to their clients - you and your rivals. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So you buy broadcasting "antennas" to increase your potential range (we start in the 80s :D).<br><br>The whole calculation of the audience is something more advanced compared to the original game. If you buy an antenna where no competitor has one too, you do not share the audience living there (for coders: a pixmap describing bitmask encoded share states). Also seniors have other interests than teenagers. Unemployed enjoy the more simple movies/shows etc.<br><br>The most complicated thing is to do as much as possible in a "mod-able" fashion (configure things with XML) without making it to complicated for the players.<br>Maybe we just should "finish" an 1.0 ... game is planned / in development since 2002 :p.<br><br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It features custom movie/series/show production.<br><img src="https://abload.de/img/eigenproduktionl2l3g.png"><br><br>So instead of buying ready movies or series, you are now able to produce your own (with custom setups for production focus like VFX/SFX/costumes).<br>If you think a sex-comedy-movie needs VFX, why not, maybe you create the next block-buster :-)<br>And because you all need nerd facts: each cast / crew member gains XP for productions which makes that person better and better - and it also gets more firm with that movie genre.<br>And production companies of course also gain XP for assisting you in the production. Better companies provide more focus points to spend ... I think you got the idea now.<br><br><br>Next to this really big major feature there is so a huge changelog (just have a look at the github commit log) that I cannot write down what has changed or got introduced over the months.<br><br><img src="https://abload.de/img/eigenproduktion2zuah3.png"><br><br><br>Do not hesitate trying the game out - many texts are translated into English (am just to lazy to do more screenshots with the English translation enabled).<br><br>And do not forget: the game is open source, so if you want to code on a bigger BlitzMax-project: <a href="http://www.github.com/GWRon/TVTower" target="_blank">http://www.github.com/GWRon/TVTower</a> .<br><br><br>If you prefer having someone playing the game for you (to save some time).

"Sports" react to sport matches having taken place - so they get information from the match (final score, teams taking part, overtime, ...).<br>Then according to who won (team 1 - or others) a random text from a "localization file" is taken - and potential placeholders ("%TEAM1STAR%", "%TEAM1KEEPERNAMESHORT%" and so on) are replaced.<br>My Localization system allows things like this:<br><br><pre class=code>
SPORT_SOCCER = Soccer

SPORT_SOCCER_TEAMREPORT_MATCHWIN_P1 = and forward %TEAM1STAR% win %MATCHKIND% against

...
</pre><br><br><br>So when the first team (team 1) is winning, "MATCHWIN" is used. The localization system is able to iterate through a list of options - so "MATCHWIN_S1", "MATCHWIN_S2" ... are all collected into one "bag" and then a random one is used.<br>S* and P* is a special thing, as I needed some kind of simple grammar. S is singular and P is plural. So if a team name is defined as singular ("Soccer Club New York") S is used and if defined as plural ("Berlin Sharks") ... think you got it :-)<br><br>If you want to make it more advanced, you could of course go further and make things like "MATCHKIND" depending on final score (draw game - "doubtful", 6:1 means "not exciting" ...and so on).<br><br>Then my localization system has the option to search for a "key" and use an alternative "key" if nothing is found.<br>I use this to allow for "sport specific" localizations - so if "BLA_SOCCER_X" is define, it is used rather than "BLA_X". So I am able to use some generic phrases - and some texts only fitting to that given sport (eg. ice hockey is not played on lawns ;-))<br><br><br>So for "sport" I tried to make it really simple.<br><br><br><br><br>Ok ... now to weather:<br>these news provider uses the WorldWeather-simulation running in the game (I have a day-night-cycle and also weather simulation over the year - so it rains, snows, ... and temperatures rise and fall. Clouds depend on air pressure - which also influences rain, thunderstorms etc., clouds and "foggyness" define whether one could see the sun this day or not).<br>To allow weather forecasts I needed to cheat a bit - and to simulate weather in advance. So at 12:00 I simulate 20:00 already, store it and once the world wants to know the current weather, it just uses the precalculated value.<br>So the weather news provider is able to see how wind / rain / sun ... will behave the next hours. It then uses texts which fit to the scenario.  It rains within the timeframe? Mention it. If sun achieves to shine at least X hours in the time frame - mention it. If it rains and then the sun shines? Use a different text ("sun wins against clouds" or so).<br>Temperature is the most easiest part: Check min and max temperature end write that.<br>If temperature is below 0 and it rains, it does actually snow - mention that.<br><br><br><br>For terrorists: each party has a very simple simulation running in the game (aggression level based). News are predefined for each level - and are just the according news events (the thing "really happening" - not the "ticker") are created.<br><br><br>Values of a news (topicality, quality ...) just depend on eg. the aggression level (so the "danger"). Weather news are more random - and sport news base it on the league of the match (premier league or just two villages trying to play soccer?).<br><br>All News events (and programmes and ads ...) are able to trigger other news or to modify the environment (so a "snow storm" might lead to more people at home - and therefor higher audiences of your broadcasts. A power outage might decrease audience for X hours, a "peace agreement"-news might lower the aggression level of the fighting parties).<br><br><br>On my todo is to have "singers" or "musicians" releasing new albums or going on tour. For now the musicians are just there to be used in custom productions (to create the music there).<br>Oh ... and there is another simple news provider: creating news for upcoming movies (these "actor X is totally proud of his new movie Y"-style news).<br><br><br><br><br>Hope this already answers your question - if not, just ask and I will try to explain.<br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
