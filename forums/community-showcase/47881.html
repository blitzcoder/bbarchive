A couple of days later we had everything up and running. For the next couple of months we refined the technology and came up with what has turned out to be a really nice racing demo. 8 player single player or 4 player multiplayer with up to 4 AI cars using the old Arkon ODE wrapper.<br><br>We have both been itching to show everyone the game, so here's a 15mb video in WMV format. We may release screensaver a little like the old leadfoot GT one, not sure yet, but it would be good to test compatibility on older hardware.<br><br><img src="http://s93153354.onlinehome.us/Mini.jpg"><br><img src="http://s93153354.onlinehome.us/Mini2.jpg"><br><img src="http://s93153354.onlinehome.us/Mini4.jpg"><br><img src="http://s93153354.onlinehome.us/Mini5.jpg"><br><img src="http://s93153354.onlinehome.us/Mini3.jpg"><br><br>here's the video:<br><br><a href="http://s93153354.onlinehome.us/newest.wmv" target="_blank">http://s93153354.onlinehome.us/newest.wmv</a><br><br>Currently Cygnus is working on Engine 2 which uses JV-ODE  wrapper which is far less CPU intensive. Currently we are forced to use a maximum of 8 vehicles in order to run the game on broad range of systems. The New wrapper will allow 48 cars running at the same speed as the current 8 with the Logic FPS locked down at 30fps... insane!!! :)<br><br>Should be able to improve the graphics considerably then too. In tests with our debugging tool, on my computer with a geforce 3 we can render the entire track 3x at 60FPS and on Cygnus 6800 a whopping 11x. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Kind of funny. <br><br>I think we will be releasing a self running compatibility test demo soon that has the AI racing itself with various camera changes. That would be a better opportunity for people to see the physics in action, and for us to be sure that the graphics and engine are stable. So far we have only tested on a handful of machines. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'm still plugging away at it and it looks totally different now (well, a bit different at any rate). I'll get around to a new demo or video clip soon. I've got a decent Tokamak driving model finally that's pretty smooth and has controllable power oversteer, which is good fun to drift around the long banked corners on the track. I need to build a few more test tracks and see how it copes with tracks like the SkiJump and Drawbridge, but I hope it'll be OK. I'd also like to get some AI racers in there, but I don't know how many Tokamak cars B3D can cope with before it slows down. I might just settle for multiplayer with each PC simulating a single car.<br><br>Are you 'cheating' with your game and reducing the physics level on distant cars, or do they use full physics all the time? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
