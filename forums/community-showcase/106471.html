The layout of the range/attack-indicators is not the best one. it looks a bit "squashed" in the  bottom.<br><br>So let's brainstorm a bit about potential ideas:<br><br>Numbers:<br>- range and attack are low numbers (0-9)<br><br>- you need to see them "at a glance" (which makes [xxxx---]-bars useless] - - they only work nicely/similar effective (imho) for less high numbers, eg. 0-3) <br>- - if all units of the same type have same attributes, players could "learn/memorize" them during playing, means the importance of a big "attack number" gets lower and lower during playing<br>- - once people do not need to see the big numbers in the game, they would also might be okay with a smaller "5" and a emphasized "+1" or "+2" to show the difference of a special unit incarnation to a normal one<br><br>position: <br>- players need both information, the Text of a unit is later on unimportant as people only need to read that until they recognize the icon/unit image. From then on, they only pay attention to: range, attack, special-attributes<br>- things like "you have this card because you won last match" things are less important - and could be placed in a less prominent spot (and smaller sized - so maybe you could vary the bottom-rectangle - left and right a small rectangle-border in a different color, or "Sniper {small star}". This would allow for a more "centered text" (consistency!) approach<br>- if you only present one number per "attack" / "range" I think they would also be readable if the unit (the soldier) is overlaying them a bit (as there are only 0-9 as potential numbers). This would allow that "diamond" to be cut by the card border (aka be below thw card-"border" - the green border line). It also allows to have one attribute on the left, the other on the right.<br><br><br>color:<br>- green red: I always assume the "red" things to be something like the wax seals of a letter ... or a seal on a old diploma. This is not a rant or so ... just what came into my mind when checking above's thoughts against the screenshots<br><br><br><br>PS: you didn't update the zip-file to represent latest incorporated features/changes ;-)<br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
