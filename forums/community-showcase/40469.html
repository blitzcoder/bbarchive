I now need to make the default objects use it too and I think that'll be done.  There's a few improvements that I could make to it, but I'd rather stick them as TODO's and get on either the animated / sound emitting stuff or level objectives.  I quite fancy the former, and don't think it'll be that nasty.  It'll also be my first real contribution to the game engine, rather than just editor stuff and moving existing stuff into scripts!<br><br>I'll probably wait until Rob's post and add my bits in over the weekend, rather than try to squeeze them in before.<br><br>Regarding level objectives, I'm wondering if this is another script, albeit defined for the level, not an object.  What I'm thinking is back to the idea of having if and setvar constructs in the scripting.  This could provide a powerful means of defining level completion criteria, without reinventing the wheel.  It might look a bit messy, but if we need to define through files what the completion criteria are, we need some kind of 'script' anyway...just a thought...and another reason for holding off on that to think a bit more! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Get to location A, get device, destroy power unit.<br><br>Here's my current thinking:<br><br>For each level, a certain number of objectives (with ids) will be defined against the level.  These will be primary or secondary.  Some will be automatically assigned on starting the level (but not all).<br><br>Various objects around the map will then include a command along the lines of "completeobjective(id)" in their scripts.  You'll also have access to a "addobjective(id)" and "deleteobjective(id)" to do funky stuff like re-assigning objectives mid-level.  The game engine only needs to monitor the objectives that are assigned and see if they're all complete each game loop.  The idea being that the game ends when there are no primary objectives left.<br><br>I think that works for most things, apart from a primary objective of "blow up power unit and get to exit", as the above would allow you to get to the exit, THEN blow up the power unit.  So we need an equivalent to onover() of onoff() that allows us to reset stuff when you move off an object.  This will also be useful for pressure pads.<br><br>An alternative is to put the level completion criteria in the objects themselves.  For example, in the example above, the ondestroy() script for the power unit would include "setvar(powerdown,true)" and the object at the exit wold have an onover() trigger of "if(powerdown,true,exitlevel())".  I'm not keen on this as it makes objectives harder to understand when editing and playing a level - it would be very difficult to list current objectives.<br><br>Not entirely convinced yet, but something along those lines... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This will work straight off as the message library I added works in this way. Maybe add a colour too as we've got 3 colours of text now. I think this will be handy for objectives etc. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Changes are:<br><br>- Fully introduced separation of default and level specific objects<br>- Added object / script editor<br>- Added ability to create objects within the editor<br>- Added scriptref.txt, this is used by the editor so that it knows what triggers are possible.<br>- Added opendoor(x,y) support to enable simple switches and traps<br>- Added remove(nearby) to allow one off events that need to cover a wide area (to ensure the player activate them) get run just once<br>- Updated map to include a switch to unlock door (second door)<br>- Updated map to include a neat 'trap' event using the above scriptng.  From the start, go out of the second door, up and left... ;-)<br><br>A note on the objects in the editor.  You'll see DEFAULT objects and LEVEL objects intermingled in the palette.  They're separated by a NEW item.  Click this and place it to create new objects.  Or place existing ones (and remove them from the map) as per normal tile palettes.  RMB to edit on the palette.<br><br>Hope you like - now I can get into some neat gameplay stuff like the two examples in the new map.  Hopefully they'll give you an idea of how to create more clever stuff! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But if I do a new game, it doesn't work, I have to restart completely.  It's probably worth sorting this lot out now before we get into objective / multi-level territory!<br><br>Rob, looking back up at your comment about creating alien spawn points, I see this as being as follows:<br>For each new map, you will have to create a level specific object for your spawn points that you need in that level.  (Remember that you can edit files directly, so you can copy and paste if you want to reuse any), and then just splat them onto the map as required.

Simply create a new object in the editor where you want the switch.  Set the image to be the 'off' switch, and make sure it is marked as 'visible'.  Determine the x,y location of the door, and in the onaction script for the switch, just call opendoor(x,y).  You'll also want to set the switch to the 'on' image as before.<br><br>The 'scripted event' in the cells is neat because it's exactly the same idea, apart from the trigger is onover, and it opens 6 doors.  The other part of the trick here is that once an object is created, you can place it again and again, hence you'll find that object exists on four tiles in a row (to ensure you can't sneak past it).  The only extra bit needed then is to add remove(nearby) to the onover script which ensures it only gets fired the once.  (nearby means remove all adjacent objects of the same id).<br><br>Hope that helps, it's really not that hard, and now they're in I can start working on more script commands / triggers to really liven things up!  ;-))) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Rob, please feel free to pop this on the web site.<br><br>After much thinking about (and talking about!) game / level structure, and objectives, I have made a solid start on this aspect today.  I'm building this with a view to ultimately being able to "skin" the engine and create completely new games using the engine without changing any code.  Okay, so in reality you're likely to want to tweak some code, but you get the idea!<br><br>The engine now looks at a "game" file, which defines basic stuff like the imagery for the main menu, the world map, and the first level.  When you select "New Game", after selecting a character, you now select a level from the world map.  I'm an appalling artist, so for now I'm just using a real world map, but this could  be as zoomed in or out as you like.  For example, a really complex base, a country, a world, a star map.  Each "level" then has a file defining it, including the x,y on the map, a small image to display when selecting on the world map, and a descriptive text.<br><br>On selecting the appropriate level, you start on a "map" file of the same name as the "level".  This is where I've got to, the remainder is to be coded over the next coupld of days.  From each map, you could move to other maps through a new script command, but you stay within the one "level".  This allows complex levels with buildings to enter, stairs to climb, etc.<br><br>Objectives apply to the level (not to an individual map!).  Again this will allow for some neat level design, especially when you include plans to assign primary and secondary objectives at the start *and* partway through a level...<br><br>All of this is currently just using handcrafted files, eventually it should move into the editor.  But it's always so much easier to just get it working in the game engine, rather than ending up having to rewrite everything over an over! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There's so much stuff hardcoded as sci-fi style that I can't really see the point of softcoding stuff like title screen art etc. After you change the art you'll be wanting to move where the menus are and stuff, do you not think this is taking it a step to far?!<br><br>Anyway, don't get me wrong, I like the idea of it, I'm just not sure if it's worth the effort involved.<br><br>The problem with the weapons is that some use particles others don't, they have different fire spray, etc etc. On top of this you have the alternate fire. There are very special weapons like bombs and grenades. Now, in theory we could work out all the possible variables for what each of these do and soft code it, however, is it worth the effort?

The original graphics managed to build a tense atmosphere with alot fewer colors. Right now there is no feeling at all in the settings.

My thinking is that you should be able to have multiple games installed at the same time and use the same engine for all.  To do this, you need a definition file that tells you which title image to use, rather than just over-writing the image file.  But yes, they are all likely to be in a very similar sci-fi style (although I reckon you could make it gauntlet style fairly easily by having a hand-to-hand weapon type).  <br><br>I actually added the game definition file just to specify the worldmap and first level - I could have hardcoded these, but thought I may as well soft code them from the off.  Whilst there, I added the title &amp; choose player imagery to show how skinning might work, if we decide to go for it.  I certainly don't plan on trying to hard on that front, but it's something self-contained that other coders could help out on.<br><br>Maybe the best thing to do with weapons is to have them hardcoded in the engine, but allow the game / level / map /player definition to dictate which ones are available.  The only thing you may want to be able to change are the weapon images and names.  Their behaviour can be hard-coded.<br><br>As for the comments - pfffft.  If this person is such a great artist, why not help out?  We know the HUD needs work.  And other than that, his comments seem to focus on "lighting" and "edges", whatever that means.

Secondary objective can be 'collected' by going down to the bottom of the first room, then into the cells up from there.  Note seriously naff images - someone please improve!<br>- Fixed a bug whereby exiting and restarting didn't clear collected objects properly (i.e. keys)<br>- Minor changes to code to avoid potential variable / function / type name clashes<br>- Minor changes to code to explicitly cast Strings into Integers.<br><br>Tomorrow / Saturday I will write up a short piece on what I've done here, and also more detailed documentation on how it actually works (so you guys can play with it!).<br><br>Clown Hunter - if you save your map as test2, it will now be available on completing the test level, instead of having to fiddle code to make it work!

It took a bit of doing (and a lot of forethought!) but we now have a semblance of a game structure emerging.  The screens and graphics may be a bit ropey (I'm *not* an artist), but we can start building a game now.<br><br>To give you a taster, here's how our test level works.  <br><br>At the start, you are given two objectives: one primary - Destroy some radioactive barrels; one secondary - kill all aliens.  If you look around the first rooms, you'll spot a terrible placeholder graphic that is supposed to represent a document.  On picking it up &amp; reading you realise that there is a prisoner trapped somewhere on the level.  New secondary objective added: free the prisoner.  If you find this prisoner, they tell you the location of a secret base in Alaska.  Of course, as this is a secondary objective, you don't have to complete it...<br><br>After destroying the barrels (exit the first room, go down, all the way to the left and up and destroy them all) you have to escape the base.  Ideally we should have a timed level-destruct countdown here.  The pick up point you have to get to is outside the building - it should be obvious when you find it, as the graphic is the same one as mentioned above!<br><br>Once you've got to the pick up point, you are returned to the mission select screen with the Cairo level available.  If you freed the prisoner, you also have the Alaska level. (Okay, so I know the context is all wrong, but I told you, I'm no artist, and I just grabbed the first images off my PC!).<br><br>You can view objectives by pressing "P" - although this should really be a PocketPC in your inventory.  And the kill aliens objective can never actually be completed.  But the *structure* is now there for us to build a real game around...<br><br>...and now, it's time for bed! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

For example I really want to be able to close doors behind the player.  While we can live with disappearing doors, magically appearing doors won't work.  So we need animated closure, the first step towards which has to be animated opening.<br><br>I had wondered if this could work along the following lines:<br>On opening the door, grab the image of the door, and split it in half and store each half in an animation type.  This animation type would be the same as the ones I keep thinking about for spinning fans etc.  The animation type then controls having the image roll back at a given speed, and you stop drawing the door object on the map, just draw the animation type.  It will have to know to kill itself off when it's size reaches zero.<br><br>Closing doors will then work in the opposite direction, drawing the final door image in memory, chopping it in half, and showing it gradually on screen as an animation, and at the end you stamp the door object on the map.<br><br>The problem comes with the collision layer.  You can stamp the map with the collision info as the door closes, but this could be tricky.  <br><br>I think animated tiles will be my next project... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But as you say, I'm pretty sure it will just come down opening doors quickly enough.  At worst 1 pixel per frame = 1/3 second to open (logic=100Hz, right?), and shouldn't be too bad.<br><br>The other issue is that you can't just animate the end tile of the door - you have to animate all of them if the door has a pattern like the coloured doors do.  Otherwise it'd look terrible.  Hence the thought of grabbing the whole image and moving / chopping it.  Good idea to use the particle stuff though - hadn't thought of that, and that also ought to be the way to go for animated tiles like fans, etc. (albeit driven by map objects).  Possibly even the concept of sound emitters too, although I wouldn't want to overload it with irrelevant stuff...Also make sure you think about closing doors when doing this, I really want to have them!  Imagine changing the "cell trap" part of the test map such that the door shuts behind you until all the aliens are dead! Muwahahahaha!<br><br>Seeing as it looks like you're going to run with this animation thing (at least for doors), I'll take a look at some more scripting / objective stuff.  For one thing, I want to be able to run a script when particular aliens die.  For example to re-open the cell door in the example above.  Or to complete a secondary objective when all aliens in the level are dead.  Not quite sure how to achieve this yet - I'm open to ideas!<br><br>By the way, I forgot to say that I *really* like the new particle effects.
