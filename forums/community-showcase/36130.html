After a few practice rounds I got the hang of it. It actually looks really neat arcade like! There are just a few things to the controls. The up down is kinda okay, but when you keep going up the plane eventually ends up going straight up, whereas it should make a flip. Also the thing confusing me at the start was the fact the camera was very near my plane. Last I Agree with LarsG. The left right steering really is funky. It could be much more wicked if it was more solid but not to solid, arcade like... mm still too vague I guess but you're gonna have to do it with my comment so far. ^__^ I'm looking forward to the next version! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Radeon 9600<br><br>With a bit more work the airplane one could become very nice.  Most of the problem is the controls. The plane doesn't seem to turn fast enough at first and then turns way to much later (basically restatement of the above).  You could experiment with turning faster closer to the ground, etc. I dunno. Also the arrow thing seems a bit off. It's sometimes hard to figure out where exactly the arrow is pointing. I'd suggest having a 3d arrow with alpha applied (entityorder -1) parented to the cam, and then pointed tyowards the waypoint.   Also, the course should be a loop. currently there seems to be an intersection which always gets me off course.<br><br>Asteroids was pretty cool. I don't know how many you could possibly sell though. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I've been considering being able to flip over if you pull up but it makes for a total bitch of camera control, also there's not really a whole lot of point. I'm probably just going to limit how much you can pull up/push down.<br><br>Bot: The arrow is pretty much in debug mode at the moment! There are sub checkpoints between some of the checkpoints this is for the AI the arrow points at all checkpoints not just the visible ones, with the human players these sub check points will be ignored and therefore the arrow will be correct. Further to this it needs smoothing too so it doesn't jump each checkpoint.<br><br>I think the reason why the steering feels odd is because of the camera... I'll look into it. The steering IS actually a constant, you steer at your roll * multiplier where the mulitplier is a constant.<br><br>Those people getting crappy frame rates, what are you set ups? I get around around 60fps on my system (geforce3 ti200, athlon 2600)<br><br>And it appears no-ones interested in asteroids... I guess I'll remove that one then! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There will be levels of difficulty, it's easy to make AI dumb, just not so easy to make it tougher. I'm avoiding guns, there are too many games use weapons as game play subtitutes.

I think it should be slower, as I bet remote control planes have a larger speed/size ratio than normal planes.  This is all guesses though. normally planes don't race in valleys :P<br><br>2. Size of the check points - the things supporting it look like wood. trees don't come that big.<br><br>You might actually want to make it remote control planes.
