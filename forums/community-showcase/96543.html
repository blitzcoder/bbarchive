For the simple reason that it may get very complex at some point, and when that happens I need to know where things go wrong. So all files have distinctive names, and clearly designated folders.

One is an emulation of a scrollable view (performed with SetViewport sorcery) and some form of "rich text" view, if you can call it that. It's a view that parses text in order to display it the way you want. It may support images too, and alignment (left, center, right).<br><br>Another thing I want to implement is for the UI to run on a separate thread, and the main game events on another. That way rendering the UI is non-blocking for the game itself (I discovered the TThread trickery).<br><br>I'll keep you posted <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
