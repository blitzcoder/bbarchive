The gameplay in this version is very simple, quite unlike what I've envisioned for the future version. This preview is basically a slow-paced Asteroids-clone with gravity and few other twists, but the future idea is to build an Escape Velocity style game combining features from Elite II Frontier, X3, and some others.<br><br><img src="http://anantagame.googlepages.com/battle_800.jpg"><br><br>Few more screenshots <a href="http://anantagame.googlepages.com/screenshots" target="_blank">here</a><br><br>It doesn't look (or sound) like much yet, but nevertheless it's playable and sports a zoomable viewport, minimap and such. The physics and space flight in general is fully newtonian, with things like gravity, thruster forces, rotational kinetics and elastic collision physics fully simulated.<br><br>There is a complex framework under the hood that isn't quite visible in the early release. Ship design is built from the ground up with modularity in mind. Ship behaviour is based on installed ship components and the components' performances and weights. The ship design - along with everything else - is fully configurable through xml files. <br><br>This is a very early phase: there are still tons of things to do even before the basic game engine is 'finished' enough to start working on the next phase. <br><br>In the meantime, please give it a go and tell me what you think.<br><br><a href="http://code.google.com/p/ananta/downloads/list" target="_blank">Win32 binary download</a><br><br><br>Readme.txt:<br><div class="quote"> <br>In this randomly generated scenario you start in the orbit of a planet.

I have bough EV nova and it doesn't stress trading enough, so it's pretty boring because fighting is too hard.

It requires three Brucey's modules in the compilation, which are mentioned in the building_prerequisites.txt file. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Still, it was fun, with great features (gravity, tons of missions, weapons, levels, skills, personalized "dungeon" galaxies), and the only thing that made me quit was the fact that you had to pay to get past level 20. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I especially like the dynamic economy and player-owned space stations in Star Sonata. Economy will play a big part (if not the biggest) in Ananta as well. It's not a trivial thing to code and surely is hard to balance so that the dynamic economy fluctuations will not get to extremes. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
