Kind of climbing from point A to point B on it's own. However, rocks are falling, maybe other hazards are happening, causing the player to click elsewhere for the player to climb to. Places to hide during a rock fall, etc. You could even have different parts on the body which would be clicked on to trigger certain movements. Click on the lower back or butt to trigger a "leap", click on the upper body to move faster, lower body to move slower, etc, etc. Very cool concept, you could do alot with this! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Its hard to describe but it feels natural somehow, and you can quickly get a smooth flowing action going on (ooo-err missus).<br><br><div class="quote"> You need to give the hands much less friction than the feet, so they can fall. <br></div><br>@Leadwerks : I have the friction set way down so the limbs don't get hung up on the climbing surface. When a limb attains a hold a temporary joint is created with motor limits and feedback enabled. Each physics cycle i check the forces on the joint to see how much strength to 'sap' and whether the limb should let go.<br><br><div class="quote"> it reminds me of something i believe it was Warpy did years ago, pretty much the exact same idea but his was 2d <br></div><br>@KingNothing : Ive had a hunt around for this but drawn a blank any ideas where I might find it ?<br><br><br>A couple of newer screenshots showing the pre-selectable limbs and tiredness indicators. Resting a limb regains its strength but tire it too often and your stamina falls. Thinking of a career mode as well now, where the climber becomes stronger and more agile with each completed climb.<br>Ive re-worked the hold system as well.

Plus it's getting a "lego" look, which I have no idea if that is good or bad. But in any event, a very original concept.

What about challenge modes where you have to collect all  the tokens on a course. How about combo's for successfully climbing in a chain, and in a correct manner.<br><br>How about adrenline boost for climbing in a certain way. Could be used as a skill. Player needs to reach a really hard spot to climb, they build up with a good string of steps, giving them an adrenaline boost and making it easier for them to take on the hard bit.
