Connect 3 or more blocks showing the same colour to remove them from the grid!<br><br>5.

Despite your description above I have no clue what I'm supposed to be doing?<br><br>2. X does not close the window.<br><br>3. Sometimes if you select a block and move off it the arrow/path does not show up until you are a block away. If you move back to the adjacent block it then shows. Seems to happen if you move slowly.<br><br>4. Did I say I have no clue what I'm doing ;-) I'm sure it must be obvious to some. I presume  the colours on the arrows etc.. must have something to do with it ???<br><br>EDIT:<br><br>I did get numbers appear in the top left of blocks occasionally, were they some part of the game? The font and style of them made me think they were some sort of debug code left in??<br><br>When dragging a block if I passed over another block I started dragging that one too. Is that supposed to happen? I was able to drag all 3. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I've updated the instruction at the top of the page, but your right I need a tutorial/tip feature to get people started!<br><br>2.  In development to be released soon!<br><br>3.

Here's some quick observations:<br><br>1) It was a bit of shock that it automatically loaded at the end of install.  Normally theres a Finish button on the installer and a checkbox for "Play game now"<br>2) It has a console window behind the game.  This is a bit odd.<br>3) The fonts look a bit Over The Top and cheap + the reflection on the main logo isn't really working for me.<br>4) The demo version time left is in the default Blitz font.  It looks a bit basic.<br>5) Where it says Player on the left then has the player name to the right it doesn't look good.  It's worse for the score and level.  It would be nice to have those centred under the labels.  And maybe put all that in a special panel.<br>6) I clicked on the player name wondering if that's how I changed my player, and it came up with a player dialog.  I was able to add two extra letters onto "player".  Then I clicked OK and the name didn't move left in the display so the two new letters overlapped the game area.<br>7) After 6) I clicked player again to try another name and it just bombed out on me.  I was able to duplicate this.  OK did some more tests.  Just load it up, click 3 times in the left hand panel anywhere and it crashes.<br>8) It didn't install a desktop icon or anything in the start menu.  So after the crash I had to look for the icon myself in the game install folder.<br>9) No full-screen mode.<br>10) No minimise icon<br>11) No icon on the window bar<br>12) Mouse cursor get's stuck on edge of window if you move mouse out of window<br>13) Colour scheme is garish<br>14)I would say "click to start" not "hit key to start" even if hitting a key also works as mouse is the norm these days.<br>15) Need a tutorial. I really didn't know what was going on<br>16) music is repetitive.<br>17) In game graphics and background need more polish.  You also seem to have a 0 in the default blitz font on some of the squares.<br>18) Title bar says falling blocks.<br>19) Music just stopped after a while, maybe when I completed level 1<br>20) Really needs a proper title page, and an options page, and some kind of in-game menu.  Games which have it all on one screen look dated these days.<br><br>OK hope that helps.  I very sorry that I didn't have much positive to say about it but I was just noting these things as I loaded up the game.  What *IS* positive is that you have actually made a game and I'm sure it plays fine if people feel inspired by the game "wrappings" and tutorial to actually play it.  Good luck with it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
