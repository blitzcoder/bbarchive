(you may need to reduce Explosions in Options)<br>2) In-game press D for Debug and tell me the left hand set of numbers for Logic, Draw, FPS and Ticks.<br>3) Your basic system specs.<br>4) At the end of each level, it tells you how long you took in seconds.  Please post these times!  Also say if you are a good match-3 player or not.  Thanks<br>5) Did you lose any lives or get stuck on a level?  Which level?<br>6) What's good about it?<br>7) What needs improving?<br><br>And anything else you would like to add!<br><br>Don't worry if you are too busy to answer my questions, but if you enjoyed it, just let me know - thanks :-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

My impression:<br><br>1) Plays very smooth on my Athlon 2800+ / ATI Radeon 9600 Pro. With full visual effects on and such, there is no stuttering or choppy graphics.<br><br>2) Nice graphics. Good sprites, interesting effect when popping blocks, nice extras like the flying doves in the intro screen.<br><br>3) The initial levels seem harder than I remember from xmas bonus. Not a problem (I finished all before the time ran out), just an observation.<br><br>4) Music / sound effects seem to fit in nicely.<br><br>5) when starting/stopping the game, the loading bar just flashes by for maybe half a second, as do the various lines of text at the end. Since they are there for such a small timespan, you may want to get rid of them altogether. You can do your loading while showing the 'Grey Alien Presents' screen, with no need for the pprogress bar. The text near the end may give a bit of an impression that something is wrong -- its way to fast to read anyway, so why 'clutter' up the screen?<br><br>6) The easter bunny that shows up after you finish a level seems out of place. The visual style is a little different than the rest of the game, but the biggest issue is that it appears to be drawn in a lower resolution than the rest of the graphics, and seems rather dittered around the edges.<br><br>7) The hints at the bottom of the screen at the beginning of the levels are very distracting. Especially since they keep popping up every single time imediately if you pass over a special square. After using it once or twice the user will know what to do, but even when playing other tiles and you move the mouse over one of the special ones, it will flash its message. you may want to consider putting in like a half-second delay to show the help message, so it only shows if someone *stops* over a special square rather than passing through. Currently it gives kind of a strobe-effect in your peripheral vision, and it really does bother me.<br><br>8) You may also want to stop giving the help text after someone uses the special feature a few times, rather than keeping 'reminding' them what its for the entire duration of the level.<br><br>9) Suggestion for some slightly additional graphical polish: when the candle runs out, you may want to have the flame shrink and followed by a puff of smoke or something, rather than directly going from full flame -&gt; completely out in a single step.<br><br>But again, it does look very nice overall... Maybe the suggestions can apply to Mother's day Bonus, Independence day Bonus, Labour day bonus or Fall Equinox Bonus? :-P <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The "tool tip delay" technique might work.  If's it's too long people won't see it though, so maybe 250ms or something.  I'll try it out.  I know what you mean about distracting.  <br>8) tricky thing is knowing if they have actually read it.  All tips do stop after level 4 anyway as you have seen all the bonuses by then.  I'll give this some more thought.<br>9) Yeah I need some low candle warning.  I had beeps for the last 30 secs listed on my to do.  On Xmas Bonus the candle got low for the last 20% but there was never a puff on the end.  I'll talk to the artist about this.<br><br>Cyg: Thanks.  So bunny gts your vote then.
