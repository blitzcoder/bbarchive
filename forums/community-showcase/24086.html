My family and I would get together and play it on occassion shooting for the highscore (which is me at 3,337,000). I'd recently thought about doing a remake and tying in the game elements into a smoother storyline. Plus I've learned quite a bit since my initial writing of it.<br><br>Off the top of my head, one problem is that the game uses the graphics3d call and the only 3d graphics it uses is the screenfade from the initial loading of the game.<br><br>I wrote the game for us to play here at home. One of the problems of the game was that my original computer's gfx card mauled the colors so the game would only work on a few different computers. Frankly, the demo release I put out last year should have had the same problems, but no one complained?? Anyway, I added a color sampling routine so that all the colors would be read correctly for each machine and the game would run propperly.<br><br>The game's original concept was to mix in the Qix gameplay with the "Hacker" storyline - ie. you are an agent who must infiltrate a computer system to destroy the evil AI that threatens the world. Each "round" is actually a stolen block of data that the people who you work for are trying to get back. In order to reclaim it you must "free up" a minimum percentage of the data (your playing field) so that they (the people you work for) have enough information to work with to crack the data blocks secrurity encryption.<br><br>When I would explain this storyline to the people who played the game here their eyes would glaze over, so I decided NOT to add it into the game as it didnt really effect game play, merely set the background - which most people dont bother with anyway.<br><br>Recently I'd been rethinking the project and had made some changes in the concept and thought i'd rewrite the entire game - but in such a way as to work in the storyline as part of the game. I made it publically available to see what people thought about it and if it would be worth pursuing the game and focusing on a second version.<br><br>Some of the planned changes would be :<br><br>o Multiple screen goals (sometimes you're trying to clear a % of the screen, others "capture" specific portions, others simply to survive for a specific period of time, etc)<br><br>o Wider variety of enemies (data worms, bit jumpers, binary walkers, etc)<br><br>o HUGE circuit board incorperating over 20 programs that can be activated by collecting parts (DEFRAG, LOCK, BACKUP, ENCODE, COPY, etc)<br><br>o Losing the electronic parts aspect, and changing to "code snippets" type of thing - in this way the player is collecting various portions of a program to build his secondary programs.<br><br>I hope that's what you meant by concept? if you have any suggestions then I'd be happy to put those on a list as well. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'm sure it was merely a matter of my own inexperience in that area.<br><br>The "sexier" i made it the slower i got. I chose to go with something that ran decent on my 600 mhz computer.<br><br>Most definatly I'd want to polish it up and make the look of it more catchy if I were working to market it - but being a public freebie I was shooting more for smoothest/fastest gameplay. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That is exactly what most people do. Your Storyline and Gameplay can be decent like hell, as long as the Graphics are not real polished, the attention will be low.<br><br>If you have a Speed-Problem with more GFX then you should Speed-optimize your code. I tink there are many things you can make faster. Because I know blitz can fill the Screen many times with Images at good Framerates even on slow computers like my old 260 MHz Laptop.<br><br>Don't expect too much feedback here.

I have not finished it, but I have done a few levels, so I can only comment on what I have seen. <br><br>1: plays perfectly on my system and everything works, and the sound effects are very enjoyable.<br><br>2: the gameplay was quite fun I thought, and I have played plenty of Qix in the back room of Papa Luigi's, which was the nearest we had in my town to an "arcade" back then.<br><br>3: Rick, I only say this out of respecting the effort you put in, which looks like plenty, I can tell, but the graphics I thought were a little patchy. I liked the look of the main screen, but it is slightly differnt in "feel" from the opening screen, and the "popup" between rounds is different again. All the little graphics, that you have to collect, the "HUD" at the top, they all look great, and the eyeball thing that makes the little sparks, great, but the popup, with that cheesy bevel is, umm... looks a little amateurish, especially as other parts are so good. I think its called "stylistic continuity", anyway, thats one criticism :)<br><br>*EDIT* and between levels, the thin blue line to surround the bottom area, its only visible at the top and left side, that doesn't look right?<br><br>I will finish, I want to encounter the evil one at the end, so, many thanks for providing the download, and best wishes. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Sounds/music really are the majority of it. I'd considered stripping sound and music out of the game and offering those as an extra download, but I really only wanted to make the game available publically "as is" because I had so much fun with it personally with friends and family. My decision to release it now is more motivated in seeing how people react to it to determine if I really want to pursue further development of it.<br><br>When i started on HV I really didnt have a set direction of design in mind. It was my first project in BB and I was learning as I went along. I started out with an idea of Qix, and as I implented each feature I would think up other things to plug in. As I would add more to the game I would cobble together a graphic for it. This is most likely why there is no overall graphics theme with each element of the game.<br><br>You described some of the gfx as "Patchy" and that is quite accurate. Many things where simply put in place to fill a role and complete a section of the game to get the full thing running. I had plans to revamp everything once I was done, but I ended up getting distracted from the project for one reason or another.<br><br>The thin blue line...if i recall what you are describing correctly...that is a bug that i always forget to get at that occurs because the between round screen isnt properly aligned.<br><br>Thank you for your observations and input! It goes a long way with me to hear that people enjoy playing High Voltage. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I am NOT the one to have the FAINTEST IDEA of whether a game is commercial, or would be liked by others, except that if I like a game, usually my friends do to, so, for what thats worth... AND I am a fan of 2D and retro games, so I am a sympathetic auidence.<br><br>I do not know why you don't give the story - it is a good story, and makes sense of the game. Peoples eyes will glaze over if they have no interest in computers, but most people who play a game are a *bit* interested, and it reminds me of "Chips Challenge", where the player had to solve puzzles to access and collect various chips for the Mainframe (or something...)<br><br>So, here is what I want - don't take me too serious :) - sit back and take a look at the good bits, which is MOST of the game, except for some dodgy graphics. And the thing is, its not really that any of the graphics are so bad, they just do not add up to a *whole* that "says something" about your game, and how cute and great it is.<br><br>Anyway, look at the good bits, CHUCK THE REST in  a brutal fashion, then work on synthesizing a consistent interface in the uniform style of the parts you like. I like the top of the main playing screen. The menu screen is fine, but its very busy and has too many text styles, and it is not the same style as the play screen. The opening screen is differnt again, and I don't think it is so good anyway.<br><br>The play area, which is the grey rectangle, is a little dull, but that might fall into line if you workshop the overall look... ? and the player sprite is, I think, a bit weak, it could be sexier, as they say...<br><br>All the little doo-dads, the chips and transistors, are perfect, I love them, and the fuse that follows you is ok, and the ones around the outside. The "storm", though, I have got used to it, but I do not think it is professional looking for a commercial game ( not saying that's your intention ), it is a bit "down home" and not consistent with the much classier graphics at the top...<br><br>Well, that is the worst of it, Rick, I hope you don't mind me saying these things in a not-very-diplomatic way, cos I would love to see a "sharper" looking version... and...<br><br>Data packers will not stop a determined critic, so SERIOUSLY have a look at file optimisation, especially on the music files. I am not the sound file whiz, but the "access granted" WAV went from 239K to 19K as an MP3, and the "title.png" went from 102K down to 35K with no loss. At that rate, your 12Mb download would shrink to 2Mb.<br><br>all the best :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I was quite happy just to get a working game :P however, i do intend to look further into finding ways of making files smaller and realizing which formats work best for space savings. <br><br>Above all I want the game to run as smooth and as fast possible.

So I comprimised and created a "copy" powerup. Look for the special grey boards. When you pick those up it will "record" all the components that you have. <br><br>If you die and then later pick up another special grey board then it will compare the components you currently have with what you originally have and add in any components you are missing.<br><br>If you have new components that you didnt have when you last "recorded" then it will add those to the recording (while still replacing other components you might not have now but had then).<br><br>If you didnt realize it, you can build the special power ups thru the components....I dont recall exactly, but I think the first power up is composed of 4 IC chips and 3 Resisters (might be slightly different) so if you pick up those items when they are special (have the green box around them) then you get the special power up without having had to pick it up.<br><br>Soon as I get the chance I'm planning on reworing this game.
