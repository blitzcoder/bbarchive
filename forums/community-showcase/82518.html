I like how it plays, and compliments on the smooth scrolling of the credits too! The graphics look quite sharp.<br><br>But after restarting the game and trying to control it using the mouse, it seems that it keeps moving the selection rectangle downwards (like markcw said). Sometimes if you move the pointer around a bit, this behavior disappears, but it can also return. The problem only happens in windowed mode, not in full screen. (I say after restarting, but I think it was also the case when I first ran the game but I just didn't try mouse control.)<br><br>In addition I don't see a mouse pointer during the gameplay, only the 2x2 selection rectangle, both in windowed and full screen mode.<br><br>Perhaps you are not only reading the mouse but also setting its location, and maybe this in some way causes it to keep moving by itself? (Maybe because of small floating point differences.) However I don't have much experience with this myself yet in Blitz Max so can only make some vague guesses at what is happening.<br><br>If I could see a mouse pointer perhaps it will give a clue to what the problem is.<br><br>P.S.

Foppy - you are right about me setting the mouse location as I was centering the mouse on screen and then checking to see if it moved, applying any movement to the cursor-box, then re-centering the mouse. Despite working without problems on my PC, that is evidently not the way to do it! I have therefore modified the mouse handler so that it no longer moves the mouse. Having tested it on my PC in several resolutions without the box falling, I would be very grateful if you would download the new version and give it a try.<br><br>Btw - the mouse pointer is deliberately hidden when playing the game and viewing the credits.

The cursor box seems to move relatively to the mouse pointer, but this way it can happen that while the mouse pointer is at the right hand side of the screen, the cursor box is at the left; in that situation the cursor box cannot be moved to the right because the mouse pointer cannot go to the right...<br><br>A solution could be to show a small mouse pointer while playing, and make the cursor box' position the same as that of the pointer (but within the restraints of the playing field). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

However, with this is mind I tested this several times by deliberately moving outside of the window and re-entering from the opposite side. I found that a very quick move of the mouse towards the box and back, and control was regained. During play, it's actually quite hard to accidentally move outside of the window since the grid is relatively small in comparision with the client rectangle, and the box is updated every time the mouse moves 4 pixels in any direction.<br><br>Hopefully this shouldn't prove an issue - if it does, I guess I will have to think again! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
