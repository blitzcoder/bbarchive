It's quite possible there's a bunch of people out there thinking similarly.  Make a list of the things that made you want to use your model viewer over anything else out there and spruik those features to all and sundry.<br><br>If no, then why not?

Even if people are convinced to pay, then you're competing with other products out there that also cost money.  Give yourself a point of difference - as many as you sensibly can - and make sure people hear about your shiny new product, and yeah, it sounds like a good opportunity to make some sales.<br><br>If you don't have anything to offer, however, then perhaps the better long-term plan is to keep bashing away at things until you do.

There are some really talented people on these forums who have yet to start and finish any projects. So well done to you.<br><br>However that is where my praise for you immediately stops.<br><br>To say you have succeeded because of your ability. I am pleased you are confident in your skills, however may I remind you that your Pong game was basically cobbled together by you asking for help on this forum at every single turn. Are you really that good?<br><br>I once made a 2 player coop and 8 player battle mode pong/arkanoid style clone. Whilst I did get paid for making it, sales wise it probably didn't do so well because it was an old skool style of game. However without meaning to be too critical, graphically and gameplay wise it is incomparable to yours and I made that over a decade ago. To honestly think that you could sell a non web browser game of that quality in this day and age which was mostly not created by yourself is just madness. <br><br>To put things in perspective as others have done, there are free versions better than yours. Without belittling your efforts. I could create a better pong game and better etch a sketch program in probably a few hours, most people here could, and I could even cobble together some better graphics in MSPaint since I am a 'fairly' decent artist as well. To think that you can expect people to buy your product when most people here could that for free. It really is madness, and seeing a post you made just now in block capitals. I can't help but shake my head at you.<br>A quick look at your profile and I see you changed your profile names about 20 times, a look at your website reveals a blog with 0 posts and a forum with 0 posts and members. It was like that when I looked at it a few months ago. Make a free website links and uploading your games to mediashare etc, everything just screams amateur.<br><br>Whilst I am not trying to put you down or anything, it is plainly obvious to see that you are a novice programmer who doesn't understand the real world yet. I think you need a bit of a reality check. By all means have fun programming, but don't think you are something special because you are not, and pissing off the very people who helped you with your projects is not the way to go about things. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It will be alive until the day I die! <br></div><br><br>It'd better become the industry standard in this field, or else there's little reason to keep that project alive.<br><br>I personally think it's better to create something that is truly saying something about you, in whatever way that may be. <i>"Orion's Gate"</i> is not just a game that I'm trying to pull together. To me it holds special meaning because it contains a lot of my own research into a lot of subjects, built into the storyline. It's my very own vision of a possible future not too far away (if only in a metaphorical way).<br><br>To me, this is enough reason to keep the project alive, to make it something unique. I already know I'll never be among the bigshots, neither will it make me one of the richest persons in the world. That's not the intention. The intention is to get a story out there. A vision. A sandbox to allow other like-minded people to take part in the story.<br><br>If people pay for that, great. If not, that's cool too. In the end of the day I can say that I did something, had a vision, and pulled it together. What people make of it is entirely up to them.<br><br>I'm not sure if an image converter can hold the same meaning to you, but if it does, then by all means, keep going and make it something. Not to sound too bad or anything, it is true that there are quite some converters out there. Be careful when you say that you keep it alive "until the day you die".<br><br>That's quite some time frame - I'm not sure you want to work on the tool still when you're 65 (unless you built a massive empire around image conversion and blew all others out of the water - scenario: unlikely).<br><br>It depends on what you believe in.<br><br>My personal belief and appeal to us as a whole is to invest into the exploration of space (because, in the end of the day, it is what we SHOULD be doing). So I'm creating something around the truest of my beliefs. Again, what people make of it, is their own cup of tea.<br><br>Find something that you'd stand for in 10 years, 20 years, maybe even 50 years from now. What that is... only you know that. But build something around that and keep building things around that.<br><br>That would be my advise to you. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
