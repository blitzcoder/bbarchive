Hit 'H' for control helpscreens.<br><br>1280x1024 causes the bottom of the shield display to become visible - perhaps you'd like to run in 1024x768 firstly...<br><br>I strongly recommend playing the training level first. <br>However if you decide to skip training, at least remember to hit the 'C' key to go faster. <br><br>And yes, that is an old guy on the main menu screen.

So I went with Molebox.<br><br>Edit: Been looking at the other demo threads regarding issues with Molebox. From what I can gather, Molebox won't run under Win98 and Anthony's issues arose from having missing files/packed DLLs in his release. I can confidently say that the TU demo has all required files included and does not include any DLLs, so if you have Win2000/XP give it a go ;-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Worked perfectly, solid 30 fps no matter how beefy the battles got. Here's my personal critique:<br><br>Things I loved:<br>The first thing that stuck out was the sounds. They are superb, from the interface to the shooting to the bullets the fit the game perfectly.<br><br>The loading screens and death screens, and the transitions, they are quick and really make you feel like your in the game.<br><br>The massive amount of things happening at once was great, really helps you to feel like your in the battle, not too confusing, but crazy enough to make you feel like your just another soldier in a bigger picture.<br><br>The tutorial was very helpful and descriptive.<br><br>Things I liked:<br>Style was pretty cool, a lot of it felt like it was just 'lazy style', but the trees and stuff really felt like it fitted.<br><br>The carriers that pick you up and drop you off in battle was a very nice touch.<br><br>The energy distribution was a nice concept, I think it needs a bit more work, but I like the idea.<br><br>Things I didn't like:<br>The amount of time the carriers took to pick you up was insane, it really broke the flow of the battle. They should pick you up only seconds after you hit L.<br><br>The old man in the intro screen. I know you said he's there for a reason and will be explained, but regardless of the reason, I just don't think its fitting. The rest of the interface is fast, sleek, and styalized...and then there's some salty old dude in an arm chair. Can't really pump myself to get ready to kick some ass and take some names when I'm staring at pops mcgee contemplating his life in his lazyboy.<br><br>The speed the tank moved at, it was almost a crawl when you don't have energy allocated to it, and even when you did, it was not agile enough to doge attacks. Even with the upgrade, I didn't get shards often enough for the speed boost to be effective.<br><br>I died really quick, when I was in the sights of the turret, there was just no way to escape, and I died almost instantly.<br><br>The ability to aim higher would be nice, the turrets were too high for me to hit from the ground plane.<br><br>Things I hated:<br>Ahhh the controls!! When you stop moving the mouse, the turret needs to stop moving too. I see what you're going for with clicking Right mouse button to stop the turret, but it just doesn't work. Make it move like a FPS camera. This one thing can kill the game. You have an amazing game with more potential than I've seen from most blitz games, but I feel if this one little detail isn't hammered out it can ruin a very awesome game.<br><br><br>All in all, it kicked ass. It's close to being great, just needs a few more things. Keep it up man! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Thanks very much.<br><br>Regards the control scheme. Point taken. I think the best bet is to give as many control customisation options as possible here (without breaking game balancing) - perhaps use some preset control 'profiles' (e.g. 'Pure FPS', 'Free Turret', 'Locked Turret' etc..), but let the player customise any/all elements within those profiles to suit.<br><br>'The energy distribution was a nice concept, I think it needs a bit more work, but I like the idea.'<br>Yeah, it is just toggle on/off at present. It's an attempt to add a small layer of strategy but it could/should be developed further.<br><br>'The amount of time the carriers took to pick you up was insane'<br>Hmm. At present it's a 'procedural' thing in that they wait 'off level' and then fly to the player, so you could say they 'don't cheat' in that the player is treated like all the other tanks. But I'll look at tightening this up.<br><br>Style was pretty cool, a lot of it felt like it was just 'lazy style', but the trees and stuff really felt like it fitted.<br>I hope players find it relatively attractive. I'm a team of one so I'm limited in what I can do.<br><br>The old man in the intro screen.'<br>What!? You don't like George?! Then you're going to hate one of the levels in the finished game. It's the level where you make him a cup of tea (I'm not joking).<br><br>'The speed the tank moved at, it was almost a crawl when you don't have energy allocated to it, and even when you did, it was not agile enough to doge attacks' -<br>Hmm - this is a balancing issue. One of the things I wanted in battles is that firstly the player should have some caution about burling recklessly in to close quarters against enemy tanks. I know in most other tank games it's all about just getting up close and blasting- basically hoping for a good result. In TU I would want the player to consider keeping his distance and bombarding from a distance (using gun charging for example) as a valid option. After all, you're not an uber-tank and the player is not overpowered. If you're going in to battle you're going to take splash damage. Take too much then you may have to expend a turbo boost or health recharge, or just get out of Dodge, find a quiet spot and set shields to max recharge. Whatever you do, don't stay still when in range. Having said that, I usually play with engines on max. <br><br>'I died really quick, when I was in the sights of the turret, there was just no way to escape, and I died almost instantly.'<br>I probably need to expand the tutorial to explain about fixed turrets. The idea with them is that they do have long range and are very deadly -  they're a cue for the player to use distant bombardment and gun charge. Need to emphasise this further I think. Might also look at reducing the gun shake when at max charge.<br>Thinking on the above - perhaps a definite bombardment mode' is needed. Say a powerup where the player's tank puts down supports, extends the gun barrel and is then in 'artillery mode' and can take down fixed turrets with ease...<br><br>'The ability to aim higher would be nice, the turrets were too high for me to hit from the ground plane.'<br>Will do that - thanks for the heads up ;-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Sorry but that old man - George Bray or who ever that old man is HAS to go!  Totally out of place and doesn't make you feel like going any further - use some of the in-game graphics and a stirring sound track or something.<br><br>The game ran constantly at 30FPS very smoothly and my next thought was "cool Tron-like graphics".  My tank moved far too slowly until I worked out the speed command.  Hmm - too slow I think.  Tanks are generally not the fastest mode of transport, but they should be faster - especially given the virtual environment and therefore need to be larger than life.<br><br>Unfortunately, the bad tearing totally ruined the effect for me - are you turning the vsync off?  I can see the graphics being drawn up the screen - if that's intentional please turn it off!<br><br>The tank really takes some getting used too!  But quite satisfying when you do - tanks are cool aren't they?  Some suggestions here.  Make the front of the tank more distinct from the back so when you spin around you don't go backwards when you thought you were going to move forward!<br><br>The gun turret spins slowly but the whole tank spins very quickly - shouldn't that be the other way round?  Certainly slow the rate the main body of the tank spins - especially when you consider my previous point.  Also, when you stop moving the turret should stop spinning gradually under momentum - but quite quickly (without having to jab the right mouse button).<br><br>Having had a few goes at the training mission - destroying the tanks etc - now yer talking.  I went to the demo level and er, what are you supposed to do?  Picked up an upgrade that appeared on the radar - but no mission instructions appeared - got bored and quit.  A demo has to try harder than the full game in a way to get you hooked quickly - or it gets uninstalled.<br><br>All-in all this could be something special, despite  some of my comments - just needs a few gameplay improvements.  :-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'm not sure why this didn't creep up until now but nevertheless, I found myself pushing forward to escape an incoming round only to move backward and right in its path.<br><br>-The upgrade UI in the tutorial mission confused me a bit, although I may have overlooked the obvious. The UI gave me the impression I was to select (via F1 or F2) which powerup I wanted. After pressing both keys to no avail, I discovered that upgrading actually gives you access to both powerups and you were simply supposed to close the UI via the spacebar. What's worse, it seems as though the game has frozen because the upgrade progress bar remains on the screen but never updates, etc.<br><br>-I'm all for tank speed being increased slightly. It's really a balance issue because, as you've mentioned, too much speed and you become a racecar with a turret but too little and the game gets fairly frustrating.<br><br>-On the training mission, the lifter clips into the "holding cell" wall.

The turret behaves like a FPS camera, but to make it feel more like a turret they just change the sensitivity. Basically, if your in a large vehicle, like a tank, the mouse sensitivity is low and you have to sweep the mouse multiple times to do a full rotation. Where as if you are in a machine gun nest a simple half-sweep with the mouse will get you a full 180 rotation. It allows the user to be very precise, which players want, but it also allows you to keep the user feeling like they are in a tank, which is what you want. Not sure if your end game is going to have light, medium and heavy tanks, but it might be somthing you would want to keep in mind - it works really well. Also, Battlezone had some great tank controls, its an old one but its great. Just some ideas :] <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I had a RL issue come up and wasn't able to log on to my comp for quite awhile, I am running XP home SP2,  I extracted to a folder and couldn't run it. Coming back to it now and I can run it from the same file HMM. something is wierd. Gonna give it a try and see how I like it, will post and let you know, hopefully quicker then this reply to my last post and your reply.<br><br><br>Edit: Tried it out and it is an awesome game, took alittle bit of getting used to the controls for moving turret and base but once i got used to it was fun and exciting combat. I didn't experience any slow downs or bugs and no crashes of any sort, it ran perfectly on my machine. As far as the old man , I don't see where everyone is complaining if he has something to do with the storyline or something down the line. I would hope that once key mapping and options are avail. that there is a hotkey or something to lock the turret to a forward view as this was my only issue eary on ( mainly for traveling while not in combat) as I played tho it began to become pretty awesome to run and have turret/camera direction independant of each other. The combat and"  feel " of being in a tank is very good and if this game is going to have multiplayer over the internet it would dfntly be a buy for me. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Occasionally directx can require a reboot of course, perhaps that's what the issue was.

As for controls, I'm going to provide options so people can customise. That'll include whether the turret is independant of the tankbase or not, for example.<br><br>'I didn't experience any slow downs or bugs and no crashes of any sort,'<br>That's heartening - there are one or two bugs still there but they're not game critical.<br><br>'As far as the old man , I don't see where everyone is complaining'<br>I think I'll change the intro screen to show a preview of tank combat, but with flashes of George (like a music video).<br><br>'if this game is going to have multiplayer over the internet it would dfntly be a buy for me.

I have been playing it since I posted and even with only that 1 level I find myself having a ton of fun. I really love tank games so I may be biased alittle.
