In games such as this going for groups to get additional bonuses adds to the play and also to the "expertise" factor that you only get from playing the game a lot.  The enemies feel a little random, and the initial enemies movement appears to be based on a sin pattern... which might be intentional.. but dont take that the wrong way I enjoyed playing it... just not being able to get additional weapons was honestly my biggest :(<br><br>otherwise, its a nice clean good looking game... nice work! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

They'd fly across the screen while taking pot shots at you, then take up residence at the top of the screen in a space-invaders style formation, and then occasionally dive at the player. This however, effectively made the game just another Galaga clone.  And who wants to play another Galaga clone?  Besides, there's another game out there with alien bugs called Bugatron which fills that niche nicely.  <br><br>Also, traditional attack patterns aren't very amusing, and the game is supposed to be funny.<br><br>So, I threw all that out and started over.  This time, I tried to come up with more creative and funny types of enemy attack not normally seen in a shooter, thinking about games like Super Mario World and how enemies attacked in those.  The aliens that fade in and out were loosely based on Mario's Boo ghosts for example.  And the bouncing aliens... well I don't know what I based those on, but they're pretty fun to watch.<br><br>That was good and all, and the game is better for it, but unfortunately it came at a cost: All those weird attack patterns lend themselves very poorly to the traditional fun of memorizing what spot the next wave of enemies will come from and blowing them all away for a bonus.<br><br>However, I didn't entirely throw out the idea of enemies appearing in waves... for in addition to the non-traditional attacks, I also implemented other non-traditional elements.  Specifically, I used Left 4 Dead as a model for keeping the player on their toes. Like Left 4 Dead, the game spawns random wandering enemies, and then every few seconds it spawns a horde.  <br><br>And speaking of Left 4 Dead... Another idea I took from Left 4 Dead which makes my game stand out from a traditional shooter is that of a director which gives you health, weapons, and lives when you need them, and takes them away when you don't.  With this director, in theory, you should be constantly near death, which is generally the state which it's most fun for the player to be in... as long as they manage to stay alive, and they get to take a breather once in a while, which the level transitions provide. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But unfortunately it falls a bit short. 3 Years too short to be honest. This game might have sold ok 3+ years ago, but in today's market, there needs to be more to glue the game together. Where's the storyline? Why am I shooting at these baddies? Why is there beer mugs, gems, falling? The graphics are good, the sound fx/music is ok, but again..nothing is really glued together. Just seems like a collection of sprite routines moving things around without any real interaction with the player or the game environment.<br><br>I hope you consider coding a proper sequel with a tied in story line, weapons shop, etc, etc. Because obviously you have the talent to code it. The media is good, the game name is awesome, etc. You just need to make a real game out of the assets.<br><br>For research purposes, check out the "Chicken Invaders" games. A perfect example of a zany concept glued together nicely.<br><br>I hope you take these comments for what they are, just my honest opinion and not an attempt to minimize what you have coded. When I get this kind of real honest feedback from other developers it sometimes stings, but ultimately it helps me understand what it takes to make a sellable product.

There's not a lot you can do in it which would break anything, as long as you don't access windows DLL's and stuff.  While is is possible I could put the game in an infinite loop, as I showed in my code there, it basically sets one variable, calls minimize, and then ends. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
