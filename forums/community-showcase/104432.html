How wrong can you be? ;-)<br><br>This caused me to delve into the realm of lightmappers, illumination etc and came to the conclusion that one needs to set up the scene pretty dark from the start or use a lightmapper to implement lights and shades.

With this technique, it is very fast to light a surface (because there are not many vertices).<br><br>a DirectX light is vertex lighting<br>Lightmesh is vertex lighting<br>Coloring the vertices with vertexcolor is vertex lighting (for example i have created a function "LightSurface" similar to lightmesh but to light only a surface of a mesh, not all surfaces of a mesh)<br><br>Texel lighting affects the texels of a texture, it can also produce very nice shades and the surface does not need to be subdivided, but the "texels filling" (the process to define how many texels will be in the triangle depending on its width height in the world) must give enough texels in each triangle (so that there is, for example, one texel each 0.1unit), and the uvmapping must be clean so that no triangles overlap and are packed optimally. With this technique, it can be slow to light a surface (because there can be many texels).<br><br>"lightmapping" is texel lighting<br><br>These 2 techniques are ideal for static lighting and usually a directx light or lightmesh or entitycolor is used to light the turning moving entities (characters, vehicles, weapons, projectiles)<br><br>Note that these techniques can be used only for lighting (without shadows), or for lighting with shadows.<br><br>I hope this clarifies a bit how lighting can be done with Blitz3d... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

With vertex color, you won't be able to get a copy with a different color<br>With a 1*1 texture applied on a brush, you can paintentity (and this apply to the entity, not the mesh, so a mesh and its copy can share vertex data without sharing the brush material) Then you have one 1*1 texture for each room<br><br>Of course if there is no need to extend the demo, then there is no need for extra stuff to manage lighting.<br><br>(*)In a different engine we could have use a brush only (without the need for a texture) but blitz3d does not compute vertex-color and brush-color it's one or the other but not both.<br><br><br>ps : IMHO, AdamStrange was right, and there is no need to consider his comment as "not helpfull/bad critics"<br>It's a demo to show the stuff ? So the black background does not help to show the volumes. That's relevant, and maybe some of you just forgot that all the monitors have not the same brightness.<br>On my laptop, the screen is just some small part colors with saturated colors and the rest is almost black. On the desktop computer, the monitor shows better the shapes.<br>So maybe just a background color to share the screenshot would actually be a good idea.<br><br>BTW, we are on a programming site, not on deviant-art.

Thanks for the explanations RemiD. <br><br>I'm actually trying to light a building mesh in "free" roaming terrain, limited to like, say an industrial zone, so not a very large open world.<br><br>I want:<br>-shaded areas, like basements, elevators.<br>-a day night cycle.<br>-ability to light surfaces with flashlights, explosions, flickering TL's etc.<br>-no cut scenes.<br><br>Perhaps I'm pushing it as I'm rather inexperienced on the subject, but so far so good I'd say. But I noticed ambient light hardly seems to influence the building.<br><br>I initially thought that turning down the ambient light would make a whole scene dimmed and I could then just use spotlights, but apparently this is not how it works. From code examples such as the well-known(and excellent) cubed demo by by Rob Cummings, I now get that one needs to set up the scene pretty dark to begin with in the 3d modeler or use a light mapper to dim/apply the shading otherwise the colors of the textures will appear bright always. (Bummer: back to the drawing board) <br>Anyway many thanks again for explaining the lighting techniques. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
