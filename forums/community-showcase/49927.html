To quit using the mouse you have to pause and return to the menu. Maybe I'll add a quit game button to the pause menu...<br><br>The Announcer dialog - that's not a big problem is it?

One thing that might add a bit of fun was interactive music, which changed pace etc. depending on how well the player performed. Also the themes could be a bit farther apart, they're all fairly equal in terms of colors and designs.<br><br>A mini thing is that the stars that fly from the menu page dude's butt are clipped wrongly on the top and left hand side of the screen. And btw. who is that guy? He seems to add a bit of personality to things, but only pops up when commenting on gameplay. Could he perhaps be utilized better?<br><br>Well, as you are not afraid to admit, it is a bit derivative and un-new, with a bit of shabang, kabooms and twists it probably would stand out more... I think what it boils down to is that it lacks personality.<br><br>Well, that was a few quick thoughts... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

He was added, as you say, to add some character; if you can think of a better way/ other ways to use him I'm all ears.<br><br>One of the beta testers suggested changing the music so it speeds when you get to 10 seconds left.
