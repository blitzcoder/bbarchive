The best option here is to try and use the physics engine bouncer is creating, but i'm not sure he's willing todo so. Overall it would give a highely robust engine. <br> - Their are other graphical tweaks that could be added such as Cubic Enviroment Mapped Water (still to be added to be brought in an update though). <br><br>Also did you look into outdoor enviroments with a terrain engine, etc?

I've been messing around with a demo of a plugin for Lightwave 3D for baking textures onto real-time geometry.  I could probably make that sniper rifle for you.  I'd need some visual references and what not.  Preferably, not references of the real-time object, real gun pics would be much better.  I've gotten pretty good at getting the files into b3d format as well.  I've been testing this plugin on some real-time B5 models I made based off some fan built high poly models.  If you want to see them, send me an e-mail and I attach the b3d files.  I don't have a web hosting service, so I'm not quite sure how to get the files on the net.  Anyway, I can use this baking texture process for levels as well.  Let me know if you are interested.  It's a good time for me, because I really want to get good at making real-time models to expand my experience as an artist, and to make content for my own Blitz games. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I will try and record some "grunt" noises using my microphone then tweak them to a usuable state.

I think the action moves so fast in games that you don't really need to have perfect, correct physics based on real life.  You can program specific actions without any basis in real physics.  For example, you could program it so if a bullet hits a certain material, adjacent vertices on the hit surface are permanently moved away from the site of impact.

The point is that allthough you might finish a good fps, It is very, very unlikly it will be able to compete with commercial games. Take project Plasma for instance. It was pretty far along, lots of people working on it, and yet it sort of died. I mean, no offence project plasmaers, it was a cool project, and is still alive, I think, but it has rapidly deteriorated. This is why many of the "stupid people", as you call them, release games that are cheap yet fun. In some cases very fun, yet they are not up to the specs of the most modern games.  <br><br>And anyway, You don't have a full fps by far yet. where's the ai, particles, physics, player models, menu systems, levels, or the plot?  All you have right now is guns, controls, a level loader/creator, cool fx, and a preliminary level. Granted it looks beutiful, but still, no where near what you need for it to be sold.  I'd place my bets on it not working, if halo/rockstar wasn't working on it. Now I'm kinda 50/50.
