Sales completely dropped off the charts in both instances.<br><br>Our original demo was meant to be easy because we knew the game was a little difficult to just pick up and play.  It was originally designed to work with a gamepad the best.  I've now realized this was the biggest mistake I made.  Thus, I've redesigned it to work as most people seemed to want to play it.  With a combination of the mouse and keyboard like a FPS and indeed many many other games today like Marble Blast.  You can now strafe!  You also don't need to worry about the pitch of the jets as they fire at 5 pre-defined angles.   <br><br>I find the game much more enjoyable with the new controls and I've changed the demo to show a wider spread of gameplay.  I really thought that changing the controls would ruin what I'd originally intended for the game to be but instead it seems to have enhanced it greatly.<br><br>Even if you've tried it before please give it another shot.  I've included some new levels (still 5 levels) but they are a wider variety and I think the new controls will have you loving it.  If you don't buy it now, let me know what else can be done!  I don't give up!<br><br>Get it from the site listed below ;)  Thanks for playing! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

As for Radeon cards you do need the latest drivers (they were made available in December).  I had to get them for my 9600XT card which was new at the time but still needed to be upgraded to the very latest specs.  If you got the demo from www.leadfootproductions.com and not www.garagegames.com this week it should work.  The demo I had up last week had a problem as far as I can tell.<br><br>If you got an error and you downloaded the game before 2/24/04, then check it out again because there was a problem.  If you have an ATI card then you need the latest drivers from the ATI site.<br><br>Other than that, let me know if you downloaded the demo from Leadfoot from 2/24/04 or up and still had issues. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
