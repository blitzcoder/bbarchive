The app states, the GUI files, the resource handling for sprites and sounds and the animator stuff really help in creating a cool looking game with little effort! <br></div><br><br>I'm currently up to V1.7 with some small tweaks, bug fixes and additions suggested by the users.<br><br>Here's the big news:  The framework has always been free for non-commercial use but on a closed source basis, but now I'm offering you access to the source code along with the free license.  All I ask is that you register with me to obtain download details.<br><br>A commercial use license still costs 50 euros but you don't have to worry about that until your commercial game is finished!<br><br>As with all things in life, I must reserve the right to withdraw this offer at any time but that will never effect registered users.<br><br>Cheers<br>Matt <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Y'know, like people in the Blitz community often do, to say 'thankyou' in a financial way to someone who's put the effort in and has very humble requests for remuneration.  I read it as a suggestion for a way for matibee to make <b>more</b> money, not for people necessarily to be able to get the framework cheaper (since, remember, it's already free).<br><br>In fact, this bit:<br><div class="quote"> There's a crap load of bmax coders who are willing to pay a few bucks for a tool to help them finish a game, these same people might never make a game worthy of being on a portal, but they might want to show their friends, sell it on their website, etc, etc.  9.95, 14.95, 29.95 that's in a price range they might jump at. <br></div><br><br>MGE's said nothing regarding matibee's framework other than it's "the one to get" and that it's one of the "much better solutions... compared to what I was ever doing".  That doesn't sound to flameworthy to me.<br><br>As far as MGE's unfinished framework goes:  let anyone here who's never left a project unfinished throw the first stone.<br><br>Can we get back to celebrating matibee's work and generosity now rather than cannibalising our niche lil community?<br><br>PS:  This (framework) is the sort of thing that makes me want to buy Blitzmax. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Ofcourse the only thing I was ever doing was debating price on the framework for the mass market. There's a very small market of commerical developers, but a rather robust market of small'ish developers (me) where virutally every tool I see get released simply does not target.<br><br>@matibee - Very sorry this thread went sour. Looks like it was my fault, but anytime someone starts posting financials about a product of interest, there's always going to be heated debate about price, features, etc, etc. To be clear on the subject (because I've wasted enough time in this thread) I think your framework is a worthy successor to GA's framework and I wish you long term success with it. If money is a goal and it should be, I would consider 2 license models, one for the higher end devs who are targeting portals because they will gladly pay 100-200 or more for something like this, and another license for shareware, freeware, donationware devs, etc,  I think they would pay 9.95 - 29.95 for a framework, especially if that includes support which is the biggest issue for them.
