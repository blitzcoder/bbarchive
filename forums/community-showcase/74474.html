Warning: Highly addictive!<br><br>I was contracted by Big Fish Games to make a downloadable version of their most popular online game community game of 2006.  I worked very closely with a BFG game designer and an American artist - we made a great team and it was a lot of fun (and hard work)!  It has taken 8.5 months to complete.  That might seem a long time for a solitaire game, but check it out and you'll see why it took so long.  The game has tons of features such as an avatar, storyline, shop, statistics, trophies, golf announcer + more ... and it's been SUPER polished.<br><br>I'm really proud of this game, it's my best one to date and has been made with my <a href="http://www.greyaliengames.com/framework.php" target="_blank">BlitzMax Game Framework</a> which many people have purchased to speed up the development of their own games.<br><br>I hope that you enjoy it :-)<br><br><img src="http://www.greyaliengames.com/fs/1.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.greyaliengames.com/fs/2.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.greyaliengames.com/fs/3.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.greyaliengames.com/fs/4.jpg"> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The original twist to this game is the golf theme including the sand traps, water hazards and irons which change the solitaire gameplay in a way which has neve been done before.  Also it's not the "usual" varation of solitaire, it's a different sort (there's tons on wikipedia).<br><br>You know we could have easily worked on this game for several months more plugging in more features that we had plan and making lots of little tweaks and polish - but at the end of the day you've just got to get on and release it as often these tweaks make little difference to the final conversion rate and can take AGES. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Mac version early ready next week, don't know when they'll launch it.<br><br>Stevie G: Yep, luck DOES play a big part but there is also a lot of skill.  There's loads of different tactics that you can develop over time that get you closer to below par and you'll need to master them to get to the end.  There are 3 minigames.  I wish I'd had time to ensure they all appeared in the first hour but it's random.  There's 3 mini games and 29(!) wildshots in all, each one I had to code the effect for and each one is animated and has a special sound track.  So are you talking about the birds and the gophers/worms that pop up every now and then?  They were added last minute as they had been on the plan all along but we were running out of time and the designer really wanted them in there but I was worried they might look tacked on. I did my best though with what I had. Maybe you meant something else?  There's lots I'd have like to have polished more (we all wanted to do more) but the producer was insistent the game went out.  He's probably right though because we could've fiddled around for months instead of just getting on and releasing it.  The sales are coming in anyway :-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I remember I kept pushing you for better and better ones and you kept on making them :-)  At the end of the day, the gallery ratings here don't matter, what matters is that people love the games and buy them.

It takes a long time to get the sound right for a game, but it's a very important part in my opinion.  Those 55 hours I spent include plugging in the music and the announcer too.
