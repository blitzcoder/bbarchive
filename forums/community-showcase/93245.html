From what I've played, it's been the indie games that have been the best (statistically speaking).

I will have a player editor, so having fake names is not a problem - the user can change them to the real names.  There are plenty of little freeware/shareware games around that use real names, maybe I'll see if I can get in contact with a couple of the indie authors and ask them too.<br><br>I've tried to make my graphics more "modern" which is what you see above :)  My graphic design skills are not good :D   The original game was a top down view only, and used very basic modified characters (using the old locomotive SYMBOL command)<br><br>Anyway, here is the link to the ROM (I haven't test this link, but pretty sure this is where I got it from originally).  <br><br><a href="http://www.romnation.net/srv/roms/6878/amstrad/Test-Match-and-Ltd-Overs-Cricket-UK-1985.html" target="_blank">http://www.romnation.net/srv/roms/6878/amstrad/Test-Match-and-Ltd-Overs-Cricket-UK-1985.html</a><br><br>WinApe is the only emulator I've tried, and it seems to work faultlessly.<br><br><a href="http://www.winape.net/" target="_blank">http://www.winape.net/</a><br><br>BTW.  After you finish a game, you can quit out of the game and list the program and get the original BASIC program :) I could possibly do a direct conversion from this, but I think from memory there was a tiny bit of machine code in it, which I have no hope of understanding.<br><br>I really hope I get this program finished, but it will be some time off yet.
