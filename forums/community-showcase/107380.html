After doing a quick room sizing. I thought it would be better to double them in scale. So there would be 4x4 rooms shown on screen at any one time.<br><br>This means we can use bigger graphics with a bit more detail. After doing a search I thought that keeping with the 2d style would be a nice approach. With the background (those cells you haven't visited yet) being dirt. Mainsworthy mentioned vampires and blood style background, but dirt gives a more harmonious feel with vampires living in the dirt.<br><br>So here is a quick mock-up with the enlarged cells and characters - hero and werewolf...<br><br><img src="https://vjointeractive.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/screen-shot-2016-12-16-at-15-25-19.png"><br><br>It has a cute but friendly style to it. I particularly like the breakout of the characters over the edge frame.<br>It would be good to try and animate the character from individual parts - something I've not done, but I do know the concept and process. <br>Thoughts?<br><br>The main key difference from Mainsworthy's original concept would be to lessen the floor up/down routes, so there are much less of them. So you are dealing with a floor with entries and exits rather than each cell virtual having an up and down. Of course, there could be cave ins, cases, floors that give way, etc... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'ts very very important that 2 stairs icons and 3 icons for figures and a chest all fit in one tile, the size of the grid also effects gameplay if you increase the tile size the puzzle maze becones much to difficult its a 1000x1000 in size, you need to work with what exists Adam.<br><br>the buttons and background look nice.<br><br>I'm not sure you doing this is a good idea, its not fitting with the game, if you want to fit whats in the game its ok, but changing the size of tiles etc isn't going to work, In a perfect world it would be fine to have the best graphics, but to sacrifice gameplay wont work, Adam I don't really like what your doing here, but I know you can do a good job, jusy you need some hard bounderies <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I assume you mean: the camera stays centered on the player.<br><br>So once you reach the left/top/right/bottom end of your labyrinth/maze the camera can stop following you (or at least does no longer _center_ to you).

Might do well here too. And SciFi is less "worn out" than fantasy but also an "always cool"-attitude (androids, rusty dark corridors, hightech-upgrades, medikits...).<br>At least sci-fi eases the pain when it comes to 3d modelling (at least I think robotics are easier than organic modelling).<br><br><br>@ tile size<br>the smaller, the more "abstract" your indicators for the various items on a tile/map-cell have to be. so with 16x16 you would end up with small rectangles for each. With bigger ones, you can go graphical.<br><br>In your games history the next step does not need to be "fully polished", but to get somewhere, where your last projects did not end. A.k.a "advance a bit".<br><br>Of course Adam needs a bit more advanced (read more complex graphics) work to get interested - and to keep interested.<br><br>It is a good thing that you (mainsworthy) already started to accept a bit of what Adam offered - do not accept everything, discuss pros and cons.

Am not sure about the tiles either.<br>If they are "rapid prototypes" of Adam, then "wow, good job" - please more.<br><br>Do not forget (@mainsworthy) that cuteness attracts also other players. And behind cuteness a real "easy to play but hard to master" game gem could be hidden. I would prefer having a game looking good (maybe a bit cute) than hardcore-programmer-art which just stops others from even trying it out.<br>Making games is not just for oneself - because then you would not "showcase" them. You want to get "praised" for your game ("thanks", "thanks a lot", "good game"). So fetch as much potential audience as possible: with some good looking graphics.<br>If a character is too cute at the end, hey, a bit blood here, a bit brightness-degration there, and voila: the blood-thirsty and gore hunting wolf is ready to rip apart that androgyn looking vampyre with only one long teeth left - bringing home the spines of his victims.<br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you add walls (identifyable as differently looking walls with doors, torch holders etc) you need at least 2 pixels - making it a 12x12 tile for the rest. 144pixels for items, and other things? Nope, that won't work unless you sacrifice "look".<br><br>Another thing to consider: showing more tiles at the same time increases danger of "repeated patterns". Which is why you need multiple tile-graphics of the same "base tile" - just to make them look more variating.<br><br><br>@ x-5 and y-5<br>Of course you would need - your "grid starts as -5" is just a patch to the problem. If your grid started at 0,0 (which it should, eases the calculations) and your figure is at 2,2 you could easily center on the player. Now the player wants to move to the left (2,2 -&gt; 1,2). In that case the camera must stop centering the player.<br>This is easily done by having limits for the camera, in this case the limit is , that the most left tile could not be smaller than 0, same for top. For the bottom and right sides it is tilesXMax, tilesYMax.<br><br>That way the camera would always center to the player but allows for reaching the outer parts.<br><br><br>Of course you surely do this already, it was just your phrase in that post above, which sounded odd ("the grid moves around the player").<br><br><br>@ big viewable area<br>This is a gameplay decision. What I would do is something different: having a normal "view" (with my old brain, I can only remember up to 2-3 tiles in all directions ;-)) but then something like a "map-view" which shows in an overlay the already explored dungeon. This overlay then could use these very small tiles with very small indicators - colored rectangles for chests, ladders, ...).<br>Gameplay wise you could even have this map get outdated (you only know what you have seen and annotated on that old piece of 'paper' you have found in that room with the skinned bodies). So if eg. rooms move (dark magic) then your map is outdated while the "live view" (5x5 tiles) corresponds to the current situation (if you call it "view" or "sense").<br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
