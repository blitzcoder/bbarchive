I think I may have found the problem here :<br><pre class=code>
While pause
	If KeyHit(25) Or KeyHit(57) Then pause = False
Wend
</pre><br><br>I've now added in a Wait(25) because I recall reading an issue where sometimes a short loop goes too fast to allow proper detections or somesuch? Anyone else corroborate or know better on that?<br><br>Grey Alien; There is a screenshot on my blog where you download the game, but the game is so 'graphics simple' that the screen shot doesn't really tell you much of the game at all - merely a bunch of red and green circle outlines. Thumbnails looks like a black screen lol<br><br>Stevie G; The more difficulty things I thought of the more complex the game started to become and I was really shooting for a very simple game. In the end I opted for level difficulty increases that utilized what was already in the game without adding in other features. There are 8 difficulty changes after which the game reverts to level 3 as the default. I personally have not made it all the way through yet starting from the beginning (have only played the upper levels by hacking them as the starting levels). With no opportunity to recover a lost life it becomes critical NOT to lose a life early on.<br><br>A request was made to make the sound files available for download but at least one of the files is something that is not mine (theme.wav). I simply put that in to have something because I am not talented at all in making music. I think the one i used was a tune that someone made using Fruity Loops or something. I look more into the sounds later and see if the size of the file would be feasable. However, this is a simplish game and I don't expect people are going to be anxiously awaiting updates and add-ons ;)<br><br>Tri|Ga|De; I'm sorry, I can't help you if it doesn't run. I use 'Graphics3D 1024,768' as my graphics setting so your problem might be either a compatibility issue with the Graphics3d call or with the screen resolution size. I *think* I might be able to run the game without the graphics3d (will have to test to make sure), but not sure at all how it would look if I change the resolution size. I'll take a look at it later when I have more time and see if it runs ok with a smaller resolution. If it does then I'll update the exe download and you can try it again.<br><br>I also noticed that there is a long delay before the game starts. If I do make another release to fix bugs then I'll make sure to put in text or something to let people know their computer hasn't locked (its building the graphics files). Originally the game simply used 'oval' to run the graphics but anything more than 25 circles and my FPS fell below 25. Once I made the ovals into images (and 50 different sizes of them in an array) then I was able to have hundreds of the buggers with very little FPS loss. That delay at the beginning is the program drawing them up.<br><br>Thanks again everyone. Glad you enjoyed it. For a benchmark - since the release my best score is 212,038 at level 6<br><br>-RIck <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You stop in the middle of your dot, but that means half of you is out of sight and if there is a bad guy out of sight then you can get nailed without seeing it.<br><br>On level 4 and above the enemies have small timers. Level 4 it only effects the green ones, after that its all enemies. Whenever they are altering their direction to avoid you (and later chase you in respect with the red ones) then their timer is decreasing while they are doing that. Once it reaches 0 they drop a landmine. The landmines also have timers (a few seconds) that make them detonate and kill you if you are within their blast radius. The landmines also detonate if you get too close to them.<br><br>If you are chasing and just about ready to catch one when it drops a landmine then it means almost certain death if you are not careful. The best way to avoid this is to wait till they drop a landmine if you have been chasing them for a bit - there timer restarts once the drop the landmine.<br><br>Admittedly the AI on this could have been done better, but just keep in mind that this program was written in a matter of 2 or 3 days. It was really only meant for quick fun with a challenge for highscore. <br><br>The reasoning behind changing the colors and throwing curve balls with later levels is because it is quite easy to develop a rythm in the game play, which quickly adds to boredom. I was hoping that by increasing the difficulty in enexpected ways it would help to keep replayability up.<br><br>I guess its a good thing that I didn't consider making the small ones deadly and big ones safe in the later levels LOL. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
