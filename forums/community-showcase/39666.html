And now all those features are separated in small demos that are really hard to even find as .bb let alone .exe. Normal mapping, mesh deformations, boned b3d files, cubic mapping and water effects, particle systems, maybe some shadows, scene complexity blitz can handle, 2d onscreen graphics mixed with 3d, sound pitch and volume control, collisions, tokamak, texture blending, you name it!<br><br>I'd like to see that personally, and i also believe it would expand the Blitz community by quite a lot since people will be hooked to see what they can make. <br><br>I say this cos just now i was saying to a friend what Blitz can do and after searching this whole site and forums, and blitzcoder, i came up with little more than a few odd demos.  And noone can get an "impressive impression" after even all that. I'm sure most of you realised this long ago, but i never saw someone suggest a CP for it, which i think would be a GREAT idea.<br><br>Maybe if there are enough supporters we could start it up? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It could be one of the if not THE first thing many people prospecting Blitz would see, so if they see someones name as a modeler, artist of any kind, or programmer, they'll know he's a good one. Would be a nice way to advertise blitz as well as people who do it. Besides, its not like theres that much to do :) tho i wouldnt do it myself. <br><br>We could have a short story. Like something in Egypt and a guy sees the Pyramids in the 1920s is wondering "Wow who built this, and how did they do it?" and the answer goes "BLITZ 3D!! Build AWESUUUUM STUFF with it, and its REAAAAAL EASSSYYYYY!! BUY NOW!! " And theres a scene of a pharoah with a laptop with blitz on it going "thumbs up mate!" (i know that sounds Kiwi-ish, why not make the face of this pharoah as Marks!)<br><br>And the viewer would be too blown away by the graphics and stuff to even realise how cheesy that is!<br><br>See what i'm sayin? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
