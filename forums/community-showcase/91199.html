I made a game before this using physics (Blaze of Glory ) and i tried to use the physics engine (Box 2D) to make a platform game, it worked ok.... but i still prefered the old method of making platform games, which seemed more flexible and accurate, so i used that. so no proper physics in this game :)<br><br>its not the most serious game in the world and the graphics are temporary - i have been concentrating on the gameplay :) hope you like it, still lots to do but you get a good idea of how it plays. The level design is not final and i need to make it more exciting and add more monsters.<br><br>the plot is that Harry Salt is looking for his girlfriend Pepper Milo who has been kidnapped. it sounds very cliche but it has some really big twists :)<br><br>EDIT : JULY 2011 : LATEST VIDEO IS NOW THIS ONE --&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvKHxdaz4YU" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvKHxdaz4YU</a><br><br>Gameplay : <br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pMvvIUCPiI" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pMvvIUCPiI</a><br><br>More Gameplay including the secret room and shows the real-time map editor in action. also i am very proud of the zooming effect when you die at the end. you can actually zoom in and out when playing but i didnt demonstrate that,<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgC_neRi3kc" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgC_neRi3kc</a><br><br>i welcome any comments, even if you dont like it :)<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

As others have said, you seem to have brilliantly captured the JSW vibe. Well done!<br><br>Having said that, the graphics are atrocious and need replacing. I see what you're trying to do with them, but remember - JSW's graphics were deceptively simple and wonderfully surreal but not poorly made. Some of the sprites were actually pretty detailed and carefully drawn. It'd be a shame to undermine your other great achievements with shoddy visuals.<br><br>EDIT: Also, I agree with John Galt about the zooming - don't give away the surprise of unvisited rooms. Exploring the mansion was always one of the most appealing parts of the game for me, and discovering a new room is a nice little gameplay reward for the player. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I think it means Name of the Game (Ultimate's old subtitle). thanks for all the tips. i had to put the zooming in somewhere because i spent over a week getting it to work! but yes i agree it does ruin the exploration aspect - and its pretty easy to spot the secret room too haha. so i will change it for final version.  you can actually zoom in and out in game - but that wont be in the final game. You can keep playing when its zoomed in or out as well. i just noticed the new Castlevania 2D game on Xbox live lets you do that too. damm :)  i quite like the name at the moment, but i will def consider changing it. it reminds me of all those old long 8 bit game names like Quest for the Golden Egg Cup and The Thing on a Spring. <br><br>Luke -  dont worry they are temporary graphics. i have to resize them a lot at the moment to get the ganmeplay right, so i wont do final graphics until i have finished. someone has offered to do them for me when i get to that point. i draw all my gfx left-handed (i am right handed) so thats my excuse, that and not being artistic :)<br><br><br>Blitzplotter - thank you very much, my rope is a bit more solid than the JSW one, but it works teh same. i borrowed the rope routine off someone on here, and then altered it a bit for my purposes.  i wish i could remember who so i can thank them, it was a post on the forum. (i will have to search and find out)<br><br>im still on a break i am afraid. but i will get back to doing this soon. i was starting to feel a bit stale so i needed a creativitiy break. i might do things like make some music for it in the mean time :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

IMO a name doesn't matter too much and this is just 1 guy's opinion. You could bring the zoom in when the player has visited all the rooms in a given area. As a mini 'reward', the camera could zoom out and show the map for that section only. No adventure lost once you have seen all the rooms anyway. It could even highlight the hidden room as a grey square giving you a clue. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

One thing i tried to do with my game was to make the basic control really good, because i see a lot of platform games with good graphics but the control isnt quite right. so i hope i have got mine right. If you are making a game i recommend getting the control feeling really good and only then move on to the rest of the game. (as you can see a lot of my game in the original video was quite empty feeling - lots to add later!). A lot of physics-based platformers can feel a bit too floaty-feeling, so try to find ways to avoid that if you are making one of those.<br><br>In my game because the main character moves quite fast - it can feel like the program hasnt registered your jump before you fall off the edge of a platform. This isnt the case at all - it is just the player's perception that this is happening. So to make the game control feel 'friendly' for the player -  i allow the user to still jump for a couple of frames after he has left a platform. It sounds strange but its impossible to notice when the game is running and just adds to the 'feel' of the game.  There's some other stuff i do like that which isnt noticeable but just makes the game 'feel' better. I notice Nintendo do a lot of that in their platform games - e.g. in Mario you are 'helped' round blocks if you jump up and they are in your way.  In Bomberman you are also 'helped' round blocks that are in your way. Most players don't notice that stuff but it makes the game feel good. so do a lot of that :)<br><br>Taumel - sorry you cant see my videos but at least you can see some screen shots now :)<br><br>Here's a zoomed-out (in-game) screenshot of part of the map so you can see how the waterfall fits in - it pours into an underground river. See if anyone can spot the Jet Set Willy 2 poster :)<br><br><img src="http://i468.photobucket.com/albums/rr45/RimShot69/HarryMapb.jpg"><br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Does Monkey use the same kind of commands as BlitzMax? when i program in Blitzmax i dont really understand Object-Orientated programming so i just  write most of it straight, i hope you can do that in Monkey too?<br><br>I was playing Adventure (Atari 2600) on Xbox Live today. its the only game i own in my (classic games room) Arcade on there, that is an incredibly simple game but just feels good to play.<br><br>@Big10p thank you, im pleased you liked it :)<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
