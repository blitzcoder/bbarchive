Instead, you are confined to your banca in whatever port you reside in, sending ships full of letters and goods to your agents in foreign places for them to use.<br><br>There were two main problems with this idea - the first being that you need to have a simple, intuitive way of writing letters that can be interpreted by the game, but don't take too long to write and look plausibly like a person wrote them. I had a brainwave about how to solve that, so I could proceed to the second problem - that I would have to create an incredibly complex world for there to be any interest in the game - repeatedly doing the same thing over and over is only fun when there are pretty graphics to go with it.<br><br>So, the letter writing system.<br>I've made a system that works like predictive text on your mobile, but with an added grammar constraint that interprets what you're writing as you write it, and suggests what you might want to next write while correcting any mistakes you make. You could feasibly write out whole sentences and have the game interpret them, but most of the time it's only necessary to type the first couple of letters of the word or phrase you want and then press tab or enter to automatically complete it. It's rather clever!<br><br>And now the game world. I've arranged the world as a set of towns, all inter-connected by roads or waterways. There is a working postal system which directs letters between towns on the fastest routes. Each town has a population, which needs food in order to grow, and farmers who arrive at harvest time with their herds and crops. The player's task is to buy up raw materials and turn them into finished products which the populace can buy, while not pricing themselves out of the market. This all works at the moment, but it needs a lot of balancing, and I haven't even gone near the subject of AI yet.<br><br><br><img src="http://somethingorotherwhatever.com/trader5.jpg"><br><br><br>Thanks, <br> I hope someone understands all this! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Before, if I had a derivation of the form<br>S -&gt; aB<br>I couldn't have another derivation of the form<br>S -&gt; aC<br>where capital letters are symbols, and a is a word.<br><br>I've changed that now by keeping a stack of derivations that represent each possible derivation that could start with what you've already typed. As you type more words, the stacks that don't fit any more are removed, hopefully ending with only one stack at the end of the sentence.<br><br>I've made a few other changes to the grammar thing to make it a lot nicer to work with, such as no longer just using the first word of a derivation as its representation in the machine-readable output, and derivations like S -&gt; AB.<br><br>So I've been able to do a lot of the things I'd previously ruled out, like having several ways of issuing the same command, and making sure you stick to correct English grammar, like "an apple" instead of "a apple", or "1 cow" instead of "1 cattle". I've changed 'beer' to 'ale' so it's quicker to autocomplete, and I've added conditional orders.<br><br>The conditional orders are "try", "if" and "when". You can type "try to &lt;command&gt;" and the merchant will attempt &lt;command&gt; every day until he succeeds, at which point he'll stop trying. Simple.<br>You can type, for example, "if you have at least $100 and the price of cocoa is less than $0.50 or you have less than 10 cocoa then buy 10 cocoa for the going price", and the merchant will do what you expect.<br>You can type "when you have at least $100 and the price of cocoas is less than $0.50 buy 10 cocoa for the going price", and the merchant will wait until the conditions are met, then buy the cocoa.<br><br>So it's all getting quite clever, and I think I have an idea of what the gameplay will be - not to micromanage your merchants' affairs on the level of telling them exactly what to buy and when, in order to profit from gaps in the market, but rather in giving them the correct orders so that they manage their own affairs most profitably. I want to do stocks and investments next, to solve the problem of what happens when a town's populace gets more money than it can spend, and possibly introduce classes of society, so certain products will be more popular with certain kinds of people, or the richer people will be more willing to spend more money for a scarcer product. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
