For example, there's a single command that connects you to the network and gets everything started (command: LoadNetworkEasyNGN()), you join the net game of your choice, you send/receive messages to the other players, and that's it.<br><br>Packing commands were created to turn numbers into 2 to 4 byte (character) strings to reduce the bandwidth when you send messages. And unpacking commands were created to expand these back into numbers again (for the machines that receives them). This may sound complicated, but hey, you don't have to write it yourself, so that makes things easier right?<br><br>The only thing that can seem a bit daunting are your access keys. They are a requirement to both identify and secure your account, so we couldn't throw those out.<br><br>The short version is: we aimed to make it as simple as possible without losing power/control/security for the programmer. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

A "generic mmorpg" structure doesn't work too well as you might create a sudden mountainess bandwidth burst if a bunch of people huddle together, etc... <br><br>For something of that scale (at this time) we would have to work with you directly and do a custom job for your game.

That's one form of multiplayer that has been experimented with although it does have a common flaw of "guessing" the wrong way and creating a bit of an "over steering" problem.<br><br>With average connections you're looking at lag measured in fractions of a second, which is an issue all multiplayer games have to deal with in one way or another.<br><br>You send a message that you moved forward and left and within a fraction of a second you've moved forward and left on everyone else's machine. The fact that you're sending 10 messages per second doesn't have much to do with it except for bandwidth reasons. And... you don't necessarily have to send 10 messages per second. Send a message whenever a player's state changes. Or/And you could send the player coordinates so the other machines know precisely where the player is (no guesswork). <br><br>In short, most of it is left up to your client program.
