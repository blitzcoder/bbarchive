However if you now change it to the updated link, the link to thread XII will also again change and mismatch in my post(going round &amp; round in circles lol) so I've changed post#1 to be only the title making it possible to use post#1 as a permanent link.

I still have a lot to do, a <b>LOT</b> of loose ends to tie up.  I do not recommend developing a serious program using it for the moment because things can and will change in my code and of course there are many bugs and omissions.  It is definately taking shape and is pretty stable in its present form, but it is far from complete.  It is your choice if you wish to try it to make one of your own projects, but I personally think it is too soon apart from dabbling with it (making tests/demos).  I would personally recommend Blitz3d itself if you wish to program an editor, it is very robust and it has all the means necessary to create a decent editor in my opinion.<br><br>I have to say that I am still not entirely happy with my current license, but the majority of it corresponds to my wishes.  I may change it before I release a final version (this will I repeat be in some time - much left to do), but I wish to keep the following factors as part of my license...<br><br>1&gt; That users can distribute Hybrid/Hardwired and/or projects compiled with them freely with no charge.  Hybrid and Hardwired should be distributed with the accompanying license.  Compiled hybrid projects are not obliged to be accompanied with the licence document.<br>2&gt; Hardwired/Hybrid users do not claim that the code used for hardwired is thier own work and do not try to sell it in my own place<br>3&gt; Credits for my work would be appreciated but not compulsory<br><br>I do not wish that hybrid compiled projects have to be distributed with its license, it is not necessary and would be unfortunate for developers wishing to use my engine to have to include the license file every time.  However, if understand correctly the current hardwired license states that the license should be supplied.  This is the part of the licence I wish to change.  I do not wish to restrain users in this way.<br><br>I wish for hardwired to remain free, so that it is available to many users with no strings attached, just like B3D is.  ShadowTurtle, I saw your original edit of your last post and understood that if I had another license (more commercial) that you would be willing to share the money if you sold your product (at least that is what I understood).  Although I will never say I do not need the money (of course I do, like most people - I have a simple salary that pays a basic wage) I still do not wish to change my license to gain money from hardwired.  By holding a paid lisence Hardwired will lose much interest from many people; which is quite understandable, I know I would and I want HW to succeed.  If I wish to gain anything out of my programming it is that I will finally release something that people really use - this will be very satisfying if I ever get that far.  At the same time I would love to get myself a good reputation for my programming effort that could eventually lead me to a programming career perhaps, which would be great but perhaps a bit of a dream.  If I could have Hardwired as part of my cv, I could possibly get a job in that industry.  All I can suggest is that if you wish to share any proceeds from a sold project is that you donate the amount you wish or not at all, it's totally up to you - but believe me that any and all donations are greatly welcomed.  However, I still will not waiver from a free license, for me this is the way to go.  I do not wish to restict HW/HY users in any way with my desired license, so I can't quite understand why this is a problem for you. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I huv see ya edit at moment. Now it is all clear. So sorry for my past posts.<br><br><div class="quote"> I still do not wish to change my license to gain money from hardwired. By holding a paid lisence Hardwired will lose much interest from many people; which is quite understandable, I know I would and I want HW to succeed. If I wish to gain anything out of my programming it is that I will finally release something that people really use - this will be very satisfying if I ever get that far. At the same time I would love to get myself a good reputation for my programming effort that could eventually lead me to a programming career perhaps, which would be great but perhaps a bit of a dream. If I could have Hardwired as part of my cv, I could possibly get a job in that industry. All I can suggest is that if you wish to share any proceeds from a sold project is that you donate the amount you wish or not at all, it's totally up to you - but believe me that any and all donations are greatly welcomed. However, I still will not waiver from a free license, for me this is the way to go. I do not wish to restict HW/HY users in any way with my desired license, so I can't quite understand why this is a problem for you. <br></div><br><br>videz:<br>A commercial product is safed into a business plan. If you really wish using the engine from plopply for a realy long time, so allowin him commercial distribution without deface peoples that wish a official commercial product.

He argues that it is for his cv and this is allways acceptable :/<br>my reputation is ok i think. I have worked on little fields in the german blitzbasic community. You know that i did some parts in <a href="http://www.cs2d.com/" target="_blank">cs2d</a> before it was released? The thing with "bad reputation" is only swearing two peoples from the german community and they seems (badly@me) to be good admins otherwise. So it is ok. That is life.

I have already an x64 version in the pipeline, it covers DirectX9 and DirectX11 and will also become Direct12 compatible when released (I am already setting up my code for this), making all this gel together is already a lot of work.  To adapt hardwired to another os would add much more work, the compiler and linker would have to be updated, and each command would have to be brought in line to make it compatible.<br><br>*  The internal code which is directx specific would have to be adapted to fit with the os's own internal system.  This would require some serious reprogramming and functions to 'translate' to the os's own native way of handling 3d.  This is likely to slow down the whole engine in my opinion.<br><br>*  If I did manage to get that done, which is definately possible but extemely laborious, Hybrid would effectively become a free contender to MonkeyX.  It is not my intention to cripple or harm Blitz Research's sales in any way; but to take inpsiration from thier work and create a complemenary add-on. Harwired is as much a tribute to Blitz3d as it is a work in it's own right.<br><br>*  I wouldn't mind completing Hardwired before the year 2030!<br><br>Sorry GF, but your 'feature request' is not a five minute task but a huge undertaking. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

For the x64 version I do not need to rewrite the whole code of course.  However some changes need to be made in the original b3d compiler/runtime/linker code in respect of the increase in register sizes.  Even worse, some parts of the compiler and the runtime code are in assembly code - a new one for me.  So now I am having to convert this ASM to the x64 version register types.<br><br>It is quite an adventure I'm having on this project in so many respects.  I have learnt an enourmous amount about c++, HLSL and now some ASM just to get my project up and running.  Since the 'birth' of hardwired, my progress have always been based on a 'let's see if I can do this...' supposition.  And so far, so good.  From what I have seen so far it looks as though I will be able to create an x64 version of Hybrid; which I really want to do -&gt;  it brings it so much more in line with modern programming and machines.  I will only be able to test it on a virtual machine <i>(I only have a x86 pc - I can compile x64 code but can't execute it)</i> since I do not own and 64-bit machine.  So once complete (perhaps quite soon), I will require testers to comfirm its operability.<br><br>I am looking into it but it may well be possible to compile 64-bit executables with a 32-bit machine with the Hybrid compiler.  You will of course only be able to execute them with a 64-bit machine; which is perfectly understandable.  If I can pull this off as well it will be a great addition in all respects, giving any user the possibility to compile for both kinds of processors.<br><br>For the addition of an x64 compilation I will need to add this option in the IDE.  I wish the user to be able to choose whether he/she wishes to compiles his/her program as a 32-bit/64-bit or both.  And for building/running a program I want the same options.  So, to extend on the current IDE configuration, I would like to create a new icon set.<br><br><img src="http://chipmunkplayer.free.fr/ide_toolbar.bmp"><br>These are the current icons for the Hybrid IDE, taken of course from the original B3D IDE.<br><br>I envisage that the new icons for the compiling programs and the new icons for running them can be 'under' the existing icons so to speak.  They can be selectable icons in the IDE toolbar, similar to the 'zoom stack' icon on the example below...<br><img src="https://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/download/attachments/45751374/display_window_zoom_toolbar_diagram.png?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1423644897302&amp;api=v2"><br><br>I would like to take the opportunity to re-do the icons for the IDE toolbar.  I feel they could be made bigger and more attractive to the eye.  As always, I know my limits and I am not too into graphic designing - it's not really my field or passion.  So if anyone thinks they have the time to help me design a new icon strip, I am up for suggestions.<br><br>However, before setting up a new toolbar for the IDE I would like to know if any other featuresor icons could be added to the IDE.  It would be a shame to create a great icon strip for the toolbar and then decide to add features to the IDE - this would mean revisiting the toolbar icon strip.  If I can avoid that, I will.  So if anyone has any suggestions for features that could add and improve the ide please let me know.  Sensible, doable and useful suggestions please.<br><br>I am also in the process of adding the blitzplus gui command set to the Hardwired vocabulary... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I have all files converted apart from one very important one which is the runtime library.  Unfortunately I have encountered a big problem that blocks me for the moment.  The continued presence of directx7 prevents the x64 version from compiling.  Since a 64-bit version of directx7 does not exist, it cannot be used by Hybrid in 64-bit mode.  This is also the case for the freeimage library.  These two libraries are used by some of the 2d routines, originally included in B3D.  None of my hardwired code is reliant on the old dll routines and compiles perfectly to 64-bit (to my knowledge, I do not have any compilation errors so it's very promising).  So, to deblock this final hurdle I will have to convert all of Mark's 2d routines to dx9 so I can finally get rid of DX7.  Will take a bit of time, but the final result should be worth it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

BlitzSupport's monkey 'hack' was a way of being able to import the hardwired dll into it so that if you wish you can use the resident functions.  Using this dll in any way will restrict Monkey to pc-only.  That is the nature of the beast.  Monkey is very clever, but not as clever as to automatically reconvert an unrecognised code into another platform's os.  No software is that clever - here we're virtually talking AI on a grand scale!  BlitzSupport's contribution is a great addition to the Hardwired compatibility list, but as he already knows, it won't expand on the platfom possibilities.  If he posted the above it was to demonstrate the versatility of Monkey and at the same time to help out with the portability of my dll; which of course I welcome with open arms.<br><br>If Monkey works on several different platforms for its resident commands it is because it was written that way - each command has it's own version for each platform the application is aimed at.  Secondly, the command set must have been well chosen so that all commands are compatible and possible within the technical restrictions of each platform.   Hardwired however has only pc compatible code which makes many calls to the windows api routines (just like b3d/b+/bmax) as much as call to the DirectX modules.  It couldn't be more pc!<br><br>GuyFawkes, if you are looking for any shortcut or magic way of being able to use hardwired WITHOUT using an emulator on another platform than windows you are wasting your time, take our advice. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Still, quite cute to think I would need to use your code for anything - I don't even know anything about what projects you're working on, and honestly I don't care.<br><br>From the sense of your last post,  I really get the feeling that you are taking the fact that I rejected your offer of a 'partnership' quite badly and your last post seemed very bitter and unecessary.  I do not need this kind of thing; I find it childishly ridiculous.  Please refrain from this line of thought, as it will not get you anywhere - I will not share my work with you, and just to make it very clear I will re-iterate that  <b>I have never and I will not use your source for any of my work.</b> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I can't see why you can't accept that I said no!  It's just crazy, and each new comment you make upon it just shows how petty you are becoming about the fact I am not sharing my work.  I really would like you to change topic, or at the best just change thread - because posts such as yours are just poisoning my thread more than anything else.  I have remained polite with you all the way and have replied honestly to your questions.  I do not deserve the kind of behaviour you are dishing out and each new comment you make reaffirms that my initial refusal of sharing any of my work was a very good decision indeed.  By the way, I cannot see how me using the B3D source is childish in any way, but in any case if you so like, what an <b>excellent</b> rebuke ;D  I can't stand this getting so heavy and it need not be this way.<br><br>Please just stop insisting on this subject, supposing about how I work when certain parts are just not true and just turn the page, and while you're at please just refrain from using this thread unless you have something worthwhile to contribute.  I am very tired of this, and it is far from constructive.
