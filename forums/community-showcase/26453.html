Some excellent work from Halo and others. <br><br>This is starting to take shape very nicely, and soon will be more than a good enough base to build an FPS title from scratch. infact i'ts starting too (ironically) look like HALO on the PC..<br><br>I am a massive fan of bump-mapping though and feel we could have much higher resolution in game object's using bump mapping, this would be great for the actor's in game also. Their are tool's available to convert high resolution meshes into normal map's while spitting out a lower resolution mesh to go with it (www.crytek.com for example).<br><br><br>I cant wait for the rigid body physics on the actor's and general support for physics within the engine. I feel once physics are implimented, shadows are highely important to clearly show how the physics are working within the enviroment, its makes the whole enviroment seem more realistic.<br><br>One thing i would love todo is create some levels for demostration purposes of this engine. I am a very good level designer and had a few max payne levels on magazine cover cd's (PC Gamer for example). I do all the texture work myself and its of photo-realistic quality. <br><br>I dont have any spare cash just now for CShop though, maybe if i composed some sci-fi music and releasd the texture pack some form of agreement could be brought about? I do have no plans to make anything commercial/shareware with regard's to game development, and if i ever did i respect the license agreement included within the package - i simply like making free stuff!<br><br>I want to help with this project and feel i could create some high quality sci-fi map's using bump mapping (if possible, espically since i created a host of normal map's to go with the texture's i'm working on). <br><br>Anyway nuff' bragging...looking forward to the next release! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This stuff would be best pre-processed so that the collisions would run faster. If this is inconvenient, it'd be fine just to do normal tris-line collisions.  The best preproccessing possible would be to store each tris/quad along with a transformation/rotation matrice to be instantly applied to convert global to local worlds. I expect this to be way inconvenient, but maybe you are already calculating this or have a good use for it other than physics. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'm *almost* certain that means 'Not enough video memory - Why the hell are you still using a VooDoo card from 1998' because...<br><br>On my normal machine (Radeon 64MB DDR VIVO - semi-old) it runs perfectly at around 70 FPS. The only issue at this stage is that when you fire the gun the FPS drops considerably to 27. Not sure if this is the dynamic lighting or something related to the fill rate on the muzzle-flash/bullets.<br><br>One small thing I particularly liked was the way the lense-flares fade in and out quickly instead of just suddenly popping up. I know that real lense-flares do the latter, but I always thought it looked kind of wrong in games somehow. Nice.<br><br>I would like to use the engine at some stage, but the licensing does concern me. I like to pay for stuff up-front so I know what I'm getting. The thing is, it would take at least a year to put together the GFX, sound, characters, story, etc. etc. for a game like this, and I don't like the thought that the license could change in that time, or Josh could just flat-out refuse to grant me a license. Then all the work would have been for nothing. I'm not saying it's likely, but I trust nobody ;)<br><br>I'd prefer to pay ... say double for CShop and have the rights to use the engine commercially all the way up to v4 or something. I don't give a f**k about 'official' support - I can always come on here and get an answer anyway. Just put a discaimer in saying something like <br><br>"this product is not supported and there is no guarantee that it's bug-free. It is provided 'as is' without warranties of any kind". <br><br>And as stated in another post, if it came with CShop instead of as a stand-alone product you'd probably be okay doing it that way.<br>Keeping it open-source is good too. And it'd be a good thing to have written on the box - POWERED BY SINGULARITY. FULL SOURCE CODE INCLUDED!!!!! As with some other engines, you could put in a clause for people who do not want to give away the source : cost $10,000 ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So basically, if you're using those math dlls just for a "speed boost", I would definetly recomend you just converet each dll to a bb for faster functions. <br><br>Oh yeah, and I'm 300 lines into the physics system. That includes intitialization functions, some debugging functions, a bunch of constants, 3 types, and a start on the actual physics code. I expect it to be able to handle some very basic physics with a bit more code, especially the line-tris collision code.  I'm trying to figure out what method is fastest. If I can get something faster than linepick (using Rockstar's future bsp stuff), I *should* be able to get all collision stuff working, even edge-edge collisions ota be easily atainable (although calculating the result is a pain in the a$$). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I might as well fill in the void.<br><br>  I'm sick today, which renders me pretty much incapable of doing much but eating, sleeping, reading, watching tv, and programming.  I decided to do quite a bit of programming, and now my engine is about 500 lines, and I have a working demo of flying, rotating cubes.  No collisions of yet.  Most of the code is actually to build other stuff on top of. i could make the same example 100 lines long.  <br><br>  Anyway, Do you remember your suggestion for physics that doesn't need constraints, Rockstar?  Well, I think I figured out a way to do it. It's not perfect, but I think it should work really well. Basically, you have three verlets defining object center, and orientation. then you have a bunch of verlets defining the object. each of these remember their start positions. They also remember starting distances from the orientation verlets and the center verlet.  In a similar way to constraints, each verlet figures out where the orientation and center verlets should be. this data is then averaged.  Then you simply position your mesh at the center point, aligntovector it to the orientation verlets, and finally, tformpoint all of the verlets to their proper position.<br><br>  A problem exists in integrating this into my normal systems, since the system requiring no constraints has alot of extra data for each verlet. I might simply have that data available, even for a normal verlet, but that would be pretty wasteful of ram. Oh well. I guess it's the only way other than making a whole new system.  This system would still work with collisions to since I'm going to implement a collision constraint that doesn't correct verlet distance, but does correct when collided with. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
