I bought it when it came out and it had a lot of really obvious (find in the first few hours) bugs. About 6-8 weeks later a patch eventually came out to fix the original bugs but that was it and by then more had been reported.<br><br>There were also a bunch of really much needed features that never got added or a few that were added MUCH, MUCH later after everyone lost interest.<br><br>Then Worldspin Pro came out with even less support and that nose dived and nothing has been heard from the author since. The forums are a ghost town, you can tell a lot about how active a product is and how well it's doing by checking out the forums.<br><br>The fact that Quill 3D's forum seem pretty empty and there's been no talk of development, bug fixes and no posts by the author says to me that the Quill is either dead or nearly dead. I don't want to buy into something again for it to wither and die.<br><br>The only project I've seen which seems to have longevity is CSHOP which seems very active and Halo works really hard on it and keeps it developing but it's mostly focused on indoor FPS (which I'm not doing) and it is even less Blitz oriented and more of a general purpose mapmaker.<br><br>There is Maplet, Droplet and Decorator + your modeller + skeletal animation package etc. but it's a very long pathway to go through all the steps and requires you to do and redo things particularly if you change your mind about something.<br><br>So far I've spent what is now getting to be not an incosiderable amount of cash on Blitz related programs not one of which I am really satisfied with.<br><br>This has rather put me off buying other packages, the other two I've got my eye on are Fontext which seems like a really good package but I don't actually need most of the functionality yet and it seems silly to buy a package when I don't even know if I'm going to get far enough on to want it. I'm also not sure how useful some of the extras are (e.g. Hud Designer/Developer, sounds great but is it very limited?).<br><br>I do also really like the look of Protean but I rather balk at paying out £25 for the IDE when Blitz itself costs £65 these days. I also do keep hoping that either one of the free IDE's will get really stable and almost as functional or that Mark will fix up the Blitz IDE or release a new one for BM.<br><br>However if I'd bought even one Blitz related package that I felt was really worthwhile and useful I'd probably be encouraged enough to risk it again. As far as writing my own editor is concerned I've done that on and off. Then I usually see something somebody is bringing out or developing and get convinced I'm wasting my time on the editor because there are much better offerings from people who only sought to create an editor and not a game as well.<br><br>Darkheart <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
