Well SR will be a EdzUp title released by me to the masses because its a game I love making it will get completed no matter what, starflight 2000 took me a solid year writing that now I have kids etc progress is much slower but still moving forwards and this time using monkey and minib3d :)<br><br>Once the editor is complete I can then get stuff mapped out and the loader for the game then get a new demo out :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Its those berks that just register a millisecond flicker on there shielding when they hit it that make me like the Freelancer way of things :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

After that I will compile for Android and start creating :). Also I have to complete the edit system so I can edit what is in there already :)<br><br>2) EdzUp Framework was born, yeah I got bored including loads of files so I merged everything into a simple Framework now I can do it all from simple commands that are all in the same place. All these commands are also scaled to all resolutions so when you create a game you can be sure it will look the same on ANY resolution :) (might have to make sure its got a 4:3 check in there somewhere ;) )<br><br>3) GUI system is getting there even more this will be part of the edzup framework when its complete or I might do it as a separate module, now we have basic text entry and numeric entry this brings up the keyboard on Android/iOS systems.<br><br>My Framework allows for scaling and rotation (like everyone elses frameworks ;) ) mine takes commands like Max with Framework.Scale and Framework.Rotation this then effects all the drawing commands until you set a new scale or rotation I thought this way was easier than specifying drawing scales every draw command dont get me wrong there are commands in there for that too but I thought this was easier ;)<br><br>More soon... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
