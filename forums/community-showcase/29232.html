Some members work full time, but the majority do it in their spare time... no one is getting paid for this (yet).<br><br>"is FreeWorld made really in Blitz ? Only in Blitz ?"<br>Currently, yes. The server is likely to be re-written in C++ due to some flaws in blitz native TCP/IP support that will cause problems in the long run.<br><br>"if yes, then do you think that Blitz was well adapted ? Or C++ would be better?"<br>Peformance wise, I believe C++ would have been a better choice.

I really hate having to pay a monthly fee to play a game. I think its a system that cuts down your player base and only allows for those with credit cards or a job to play. <br><br>Bottom line If im not gona pay subs for EQ im not gona pay it for FW..<br><br>I am at this time in no way saying its not worth it. Already its stolen to many hours from me. its already a class game and I cant wait till its finished.<br><br>I know Most Developers seek the Cash at the end of a project. As a Developer I feel this way as well. However I feel that the trend in games going subs is a bad one.<br><br>I also think there are a lot more ways of getting the funds in to pay for the game. A lot of ways most people just would not think of, I have a lot in mind for an RPG I have in planning. and I would be willing to share them but not in public.<br><br>I will give an example though.<br><br>If FW goes subs, I can see around 3-5 hundred people being willing to pay. could be less. this for a whiel would be a steady flow of money for the DEV's to help pay for the server and such. I cant really see this growing much over 500, specially when EQ and many others offer the same thing with better GFX &amp; Sound (no offence)..<br><br>NOW.<br><br>If they go Buy and play. I can see a hell of a lot more people buying the game, lets just chuck out a number. lets say around 4 or 5 thousand people buy it. and say your selling it at about £25 £30(which id buy at) then thats a hell of a lot of money...<br><br>TBH once the Online RPG community gets wind of a good MMORPG that you dont have to pay subs for, they will be jumping at it like mad men on steroids.<br><br>just my 2p <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It benefits hard core players cost wise, but there the ones that will cost us the most to run the server.<br><br><br>We have promised to keep the cost as low as possible, hopefully giving us some advantage over other bigger MMORPGs who often charge way more than they need to.
