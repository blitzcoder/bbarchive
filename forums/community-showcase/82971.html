So with that in mind I'm open to comments and suggestions as you feel are appropriate.<br><br>You can download the game by clicking on the following link: <a href="http://www.box.net/shared/pjqb2siuuc" target="_blank">Download Link</a><br><br>Or have a look at the Pioneer site: <a href="http://www.thephorse.net/pioneer" target="_blank">Pioneer Home Page</a><br><br>And, as it should be, here are some screenshots (some of which were already in the gallery)<br><br><a href="http://www.thephorse.net/pioneer/imgs/screen1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.thephorse.net/pioneer/imgs/screen1_small.jpg"></a><a href="http://www.thephorse.net/pioneer/imgs/screen2.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.thephorse.net/pioneer/imgs/screen2_small.jpg"></a><a href="http://www.thephorse.net/pioneer/imgs/screen3.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.thephorse.net/pioneer/imgs/screen3_small.jpg"></a><br><br>The full game only costs £10!<br><br>Thanks for looking :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Good luck with it.  Love those zoomed in screenshots - what a good idea ;-)<br><br>I agree that some of the fonts are hard to read, perhaps you could keep them but put a pixel of space between them if you are using a Bitmap Font and can alter the code (i.e you are not using DrawText).  If you ARE using DrawText (it's slow btw), then I posted a modified version in the Public Domain part of the Framework that allows you to specify a space between each letter.  It may be useful as several of us have mentioned it.  This is assuming the game is BMax right?<br><br>How many characters do you have?  If you have the budget or can find a helpful artist, I suggest getting them redone more professionally (hope I haven't insulted whoever did them, was it you?). I think that it will make the logo on the top of the page with the 4 chars look much more pro and encourage more downloads.  Blaine really needs redoing too.  There are other areas that could also be polished to look less like programmer art which would increase sales I'm sure as would adding mouse support.  The actual game itself seemed fine (cool in fact), it was just the interfaces including the communication bits that weren't as good quality imho...  If you are interested in more guidance along these lines, feel free to email me. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The ships are fine though.  Some artists are better at characters and others at objects.  Your characters certainly have "character" but there is something a little too quirky about them imho.  An important factor in getting customers to shell out money on your games is to make them look professional throughout - this is perceived quality (even if the game is poop) and makes them more likely to see it as worth spending money on.<br><br>As far as budget goes, I've learned that the more you spend (providing you know what you are doing and aren't pointlessly p*ssing money away) the more you get in return.  I spent over £1000 on Holiday Bonus of money that I didn't have (got a loan) but have made it back 10x over.  Wish I'd spent even more now, lol (well actually I didn't have enough time to add any more in before Christmas).  Also that game has a big target market and yours is probably more specialist so spending what you did may have been wise...certainly as you gain more experience and a bigger customer base it's worth considering spending more money if you are fairly positive about getting a good return.

I realize its about upgrading it, and I probably haven't seen enough to see how good it gets--- but by the time I wanted to buy the second item from the rock dude, chasing down asteroids was a chore just due to how slow the ship moves/rotates.( Even after I got the rotational upgrade )<br><br>-I did find a visual glitch/bug while landing on a planet. A large portion of the amoeba like things, and even a column of rock, all ended up stuck to the left side of the screen.

I do plan to add a couple of extra side quests in once the GUI update is done.<br><br>Getting to sector 11 can be a bit of a challenge - you have to talk to 4 different people near the end of the game. Hint: How much of the code did you get? (you can see the code in the cargo screen) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
