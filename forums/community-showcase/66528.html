Same for all loops, functions etc. I hope that you'll like this.<br>Note: This will function correctly only if your code is correctly indented<br><br>"<b>Ability to Highlight as 'Bad'  functions that return value, if braces are missing after the function call</b>"  - asked by Boiled Sweets, this feature can save you additional hours in<br>debugging your code, because compiler won't complain if you forget to add braces on some functions that require braces to function properly.<br>Example : MouseX() - If you forget the braces, compiler will just return zero. Now, IDEal can warn you about this kind of error.<br>Note: IDEal will highlight functions that are specified to return values and don't have any obligatory parameters. Functions that require parameters aren't checked for this rule, because there are functions ( like AddVertex) that can be used with or without braces, i.e. when you don't need the returning value. And compiler will anyway warn you if you omit parameters on these.<br>The only command that requires no parameters and can be used in both ways is "WaitKey" command, so you'll have to add braces even if you don't use the returning value.<br>Also note that this option is OFF by default, because it can confuse some users.<br><br><b>Includes</b> - Just to note that to open them , you need to right click and choose "Open" from the menu.<br><br>Option - <b>Home key jumps to the first position in the line</b> - by default Home key positions the cursor to the first character in the line.<br><br><b>Ability to open html files from the file explorer in the internal browser</b><br>This is optional -there is an option in Preferences-&gt;Browser ... Now you can open Html files from file explorer or from favorites files in the file explorer in the internal browser. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

<table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr ><td class="posthead"><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr ><td >Trixx</td><td align="right"><font class=tiny>(Posted 2007)</font>&nbsp;<a href="#3">[#3]</a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr ><td class="posttext"> Some tips and little explanations for those that are first time using IDEal :<br><br>1. IDEal by default emulates Strict command and will highlight in Red color all of the code that is not properly declared in the project /file. So, either turn off this option by selecting other color for "bad text" in the color scheme, or better start declaring your Local variables and put a proper userlib ( .decls ) file for libraries that are not in the project, because this option will save you numerous hours when hunting bugs in your code.<br><br>2. You can customize all of the Menus, Toolbars and even the Context menu, together with the shortcuts for all of the commands.  Just right click on empty toolbar space and choose "Customize".. New "POPUP" menu will show up in the main menu line, which is your context menu in the editor. Go to "keyboard" to customize shortcuts, or arrange your menus with drag-dropping of the commands, right clicking on the commands to rename/delete them form the menu etc.<br><br>3. Custom foldable blocks of code are created using ' ;[Block] ' and ';[End]' commands. You can also create them with 'Block from selection' command<br><br>4. If you associate .bb files with IDEal, there are ten different icons to choose from for the .bb files - look into the ICONS folder...<br><br>5. When you are opening files or adding files to a project, you can select multiple files in the Open Dialog Box , so you don't need to invoke Open command for each file. Same applies when opening files from the Windows Explorer or dropping files from Windows Explorer to the editor <br><br>6. Scope completion - means Auto completion of lines with scope keywords and positioning of the cursor on the "right place".  You have total control when to apply this command by using shortcut.<br>Better see it in action through example:  type For i=1 to 10 and press CTRL+ENTER ( default shortcut for 'Complete scope' command )<br><br>7. CTRL + Left Click on the marker margin ( the one between line numbers and folding margin ) toggles breakpoint.  Shift + Left Click on the same margin toggles bookmark<br><br>8. "Important comment " is made by placing ! immediately after ; in the comment itself.<br>; This is normal comment<br>;! This is important comment ( 'Comment2' color and style in the Color scheme ) <br><br>9. Advanced autoindenting:  Autoindent will work properly in these situations:<br>If a=b then c=d<br>---------------<br>If a=b then<br>c=d<br>end if<br>---------------<br>If a=b<br>c=d<br>end if<br>---------------<br>But will not indent correctly in this particular case:<br>If a=b c=d<br>So, if you're using this style, then go to the editor settings and switch to simple autoindenting , but I strongly recommend to use other 'types' of IF..THEN statements, because advanced autoindenting is so powerful once you are used to it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So, feel free to vote for features that you need or to add other features to this list.  Any bug fixes will have greatest priority of course :) Other depends on the time they need to be implemented, number of people that needs them etc...<br><br><br>External tools - this will allow you to define and start external tools ( like UPX, Cod2Doc, preprocessors ) with some parameters - like UPX 'Last Created EXE' or Cod2Doc This file/project<br><br>Refactoring step 2- Renaming Functions / Variables across the file/project<br><br>Command to list all Functions / Variables that are not used in the file/project. And maybe a similar command to show where they are used  <br><br>Automatic Code Formatter- will format every added/edited line following some simple criteria that you specify. Something that will Add or Remove spaces in the line, i.e. around operators/ braces , after commas, or  remove multiple spaces, add missing spaces in the line... This one will auto-beautify code for you and will reduce the need to add/delete spaces and tabs manually.<br><br>Ability to not load all files from the project - I'm still not sure about this one, it needs some clarifications first... unlike some other IDEs, IDEal is parsing and collecting information about code structures from all files in the project, and probably it's better to leave some libraries outside from the project and include only files that will be actually edited. Why ? Because I'm sure that you don't want to see types/variables from a 3rd party library in the Intellisense and Autocomplete lists, in the CodeExplorer etc.. Variables that you don't need to know anything about them and you surely won't use them. So isn't it better to just put an "include" for that library and if you ever want to load that library, you can open it from includes. And if you want to edit/add features in that library, then it should be included in the project.<br>Don't take me wrong on this, this is easily doable, but I just need an opinion - Should IDEal parse files that are not loaded, or you just need for them to be visible in the project Explorer. Should "Find in Project" search them too or not ? Should "Goto Declaration" open ( then they should be parsed ) them or not ...<br><br><br>Option to not copy project's files in the project's folder when creating project... This one is also problematic - currently projects are based on relative paths, so you can easily take you project folder and copy it anywhere, start on another PC, use it form an USB drive etc ... If I change to relative paths, all this will be lost, i.e. you'll have to recreate the project everytime you move your project. USB drives for example, take different drive letter on a different PC. And I don't like the idea for this to be optional, so let's think again about this one.<br><br>Listing of Media files ( images, sounds, objects ) in the Code Explorer<br><br>option - Apply "autoindent this function" automatically when commenting/uncommenting block of lines<br><br>Option to not sort in the code explorer and option to 'Show All Together' in the code Explorer<br><br>Print/ Print Preview<br><br>Export to HTML<br><br>Find &amp; Replace: Exclude comments from searching / Find only in comments ...<br><br>Option to mark all lines that were edited after the file was loaded<br><br>AutoBackup /Incremental Backup  implementation<br><br>ToDo /History implementation<br><br>Ability to include .txt, html and media files in the project <br><br>Expression Evaluator - this one would support all standard math and all blitz math functions. <br><br>Icon hacker - to change the icon in the created executable.. maybe I'll leave this job to the external tool, i.e. to start " ResHacker LastCreatedExe "<br><br>Userlib creator - to create .decls file for your project / library <br><br>Spell check for strings in the files <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I was surfing through the community and found your IDEal and WOW that is a great IDE for Blitz+!!!!<br><br>I do have 2 suggestions or idea:<br><br>When I open a project with some included files IDEal opens them in the active Tab group. Then I do open the next project and IDEal opens this files also in the active tab group if I do not create manualy a new tab group with a empty file in it.<br><br>Is there a way, that every project creates it's own tab group when I open it?<br><br>And ...<br><br>a idea would be to be able to show and hide a opened project in a tab group without first closing the project and load it later to get better view in the editor part of your IDEal. Just show and hide the entire tab group.<br><br>And at last one question:<br>Will you add Blitz Max to this IDE too?<br>I'm thinking about to buy Blitz Max because the better GUI (as I found out by reading the postings in this community)<br><br><br><br>But I have to say WOW again... :-)))<br><br>(Sorry for my bad english, I'm from Swizerland) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
