But development is still going on, and support for other game types will be added in future releases. At least a platformer capability should be added, and maybe some sort of Double Dragon-style beat'em up thing as well. The engine already has the basic framework in place; I just need to add a few additional options and control schemes, and these should be possible to do.<br><br>Some of the menus might seem a little bit clumsy to use at first, because there are so many switches and sub menus, but once you get the hang of it, it should be quite easy to understand. :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The platformer capability at least should be ready before this year is over...<br><br>But even with all the planned "game genre" additions, it would still be just an "action game" construction kit. So no RPGs, strategy games or adventures...and this is how it was meant be: the program's focus is 100% on action games.<br><br>But I don't know about simple puzzle games; maybe these too could be added in the future, if I find some cool "shortcuts" on how to add basic puzzle elements to the system. :)<br><br>---<br><br>So in it's core the M484GCS is just a "clicky" construction kit for "arcade style" action games...But with so many switches, buttons, options and Blitz-Power, that one can replicate most stuff that was found in the best commercial shoot'em ups of the "Amiga-era".<br><br>Right now it can comfortably do Horizontal and Vertical scrolling games, either with Push or Auto Scroll, so all sorts of Battle Squadron, Z-Out and Commando clones should already be possible to make. And after I add the platformer capability, then it can do Turrican and Megaman X clones as well, or so I hope in my megalomaniac day dreams. :D <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
