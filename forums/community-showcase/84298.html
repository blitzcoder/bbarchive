The game defaults to OpenGL and "normal" particles, please do try changing those.  Do you by chance have on-board Intel graphics... or what video card do you have?  I have profiled the game on a number of computers, the remaining performance problems are usually draw related.... the objects are lines not images so that's 3 quads for each line and standard blitzmax drawimage for all the particles.  <br><br>also remember this is not standard 2d asteroids with a 2d card... by chance have you played GridWars or Annihilation on your machine, how do they compare? <br><br>Could you run the game for me and when it gets slow hit "F12" and play a little longer then quit the game and send the resulting file "Rocks stats.txt" to my email address you get from clicking my account name above?<br><br>anybody else have any performance issues? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I really enjoy the balance that part of the game creates.  especially in higher levels where you have to decide *when* to just shoot everything and when not to because sometimes starting a level will mean lowering your ships capabilities which sucks at those high of levels. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Love it... I dont even have one criticism at all<br><br>Looks beautiful, plays great (love the reverse thrusters btw)<br><br>one suggestion (because it happened in game) if you shoot a mine * and its right next to an asteroid it should seriously blow the sh*t out of the asteroid :)<br><br>Awesome work! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you finish the first one too fast, then the words on the next level run into those that are displayed from the previous.  That is, if there's already text there and you start a new level it writes over the top.  It also kind of acted weird.  For instance I was playing for hours to try to get those 6 powerups in the second basic training level.  Then it would just glitch (like I would get a pickup when the level was changing) and instantly it became a different level than I had seen.  I can't really explain it much clearer than that because I can't reproduce the problem exactly.  But just sometimes it would jump levels, and sometimes the text would overwrite existing text.<br><br>Please, please, slow down the acceleration speed!  (That is it gets really fast way too fast... I can't really control it)<br><br>That being said I did play the actual game, and it totally kicked my butt.  Although the sounds and graphics and stuff are really cool.  I'm actually going to give it a review tomorrow morning, and even with the problems I've had, going to give it some positive press. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
