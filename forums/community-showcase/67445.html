External tools: Go to Settings-&gt;External tools to define external tools. A menu for running of the external tools is located in Compile-&gt;Run External tool... If you don't like the location of this menu, go to customize mode and move it wherever you like. There are predefined "UPX Last created EXE" and "Cod2Doc ActiveFile". You'll need to setup locations for these utils though.<br><br>2. Option to not sort functions in the Code Explorer  - This implementation is actually slower than the default one, because it's build on top of the default one. So, if you turn this option ON, automatic refreshing of the Code Explorer may be slow for files with more than several hundred functions.  This option is located under Preferences-&gt;General tab and defaults to OFF.<br><br>3. Known bug in this release: If you open two different projects ( at the same time ) that use the same file on the same location, IDEal will throw an exception. This will be fixed for the next release. All other bugs that were reported are fixed for this release, though there are few visual improvements that need to be implemented for the next release.<br><br>4. Automatic conversion of Var++ ( or -- ) ... This is realtime conversion, i.e. in the same moment as you type the second plus sign. IDEal will check if the word before ++ could be a variable. It'll not full check if the word is a valid variable, because that will make this feature unusable for those that don't use 'Strict emulation". As a result, any word that can be a variable name will be valid, i.e. typing functionname++ will also do a conversion. However, strings, other operators and some other non-word text won't be automatically converted if you make a mistake. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The "Insert Filename" function.  It's a menu item that opens a file browser.  Select a file and it adds the filename chosen (including full path), in quotes, at the insertion point.  <br><br>... You know what?  I just thought "Hey, I'd better check for sure to make sure it's not in there yet", and lo and behold:   Edit -&gt; Insert -&gt; Insert Filename.<br><i>"This feature is not available yet, please wait for the next release..."</i>  <b>You big tease!</b>  :o)  Thanks for that.<br><br>2.  An option presents you with a list of userlibs currently installed in the appropriate directory, and through the use of checkboxes lets you enable or disable each userlib (by renaming the file into something like "<i>userlibname.decl.disabled</i>")  It's handy for experimenting with various userlibs without having to worry about potential function name conflicts or whatnot, and it's certainly a lot easier than heading into the userlib directory and manually renaming, moving or deleting them each time.<br><br>As I said, these are the only two things I miss from Visual Blitz, but there are so very many more things you've added that I didn't know I wanted until you gave them to me, that I'm well ahead as far as ease-of-use goes.<br><br>Thankyou for continuing to develop the best IDE for the legacy Blitz products yet.  :o) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
