Why LE should be treated in a special way here is also beyond me, more after the way it treats BlitzMax and this is not a LE forum.<br><br>For the prices you stated, LE has increased to $250, which puts it into the same region as Shiva now without valuing any differences of what you get for your money then.

And this could or couldn't be true, as no one has a magic wand. What you can do right now counts when you buy a product (how you can use or value what's not there yet?). As I said earlier, you could find more suitable engines for a comparison instead of looking at apples and oranges.<br><br><br><div class="quote"> I don't think it is the wrong thread were a product has been showcased to discuss it and its technical abilities as well as talk about relevant alternatives but after what he wrote in this thread i can imagine that he, and his fellows, <br></div><br>I would like to point out that I'm a 'fellow' who other than LE owns Xors3D, all Blitz products except B3D SDK, Torque products, other lightmappers, and a bunch of other sometimes even costly stuff useful for graphics and development (in fact, I don't need PureLight, but many could). Also installed are Shiva Learning and Unity 2.6 and Visual Studio 2005 + XNA and Unreal SDK. I thought I should clear that before you start pointing fingers, that is.<br><br>Personally I would love a great integrated environment, but after some years I started to prefer pure coding and a good modeller/layout (which comes pretty near) 'cause of the workarounds needed around scripting, but about that at the moment I'm looking at Unreal SDK as a learning tool. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
