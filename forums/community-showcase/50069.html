Some graphics glitches:  At the start, shooting doesn't fire a bullet, a weird poygonal mess appears at a random place on the screen.  Also there appeared to be invisible objects I was picking up.  The grass has a brown flickery horiz line in it.  Some of the boulders in the solid background flicker round them.  I think that's it.

It seem anything static that isn't welded isn't getting sorted 100 percent perfectly - and I don't know how to fix this without welding everything which in itself might give unwanted smoothing and look ugly in lots of places.<br><br>As for loading times - I think it's machine specific again.

XP Home SP2, P4 3.2GHz, 1Gb RAM, Radeon 9800XT.  800x600 gives 75fps (my refresh rate) and I get the same rate in 1280x1024 although to be honest it looks just as good in 800x600 because the graphics are so nice.  I would say a good default is 800x600 and higher is OTT.  No funny artifacts or anything and now I can see all the fruit and coins which were invisible on the Laptop.  The laptop SiS card is not 3D so it's crap basically but you wanna bear this in mind for min specs.  The Laptop CPU and RAM were fine but the video card just couldn't handle it, which is fair enough.<br><br>Noticed that if you stand a fire continuously, the 2nd shot is lower than the first then the 3rd shot is higher and then it stays moreless steady but you have made the starting Y position slightly vary up and down, right?  Also it is above the gun barrel which doesn't look so good.  When crouching a similar thing occurs, first few shows vary a lot in Y direction then it steadies out but still varies.<br><br>Jumping: It seems you cannot jump as high on a standing jump as a diagonal one.  So if you stand at the edge of a platform and try to standing jump and press across at the last minute you won't make it.  You have to run back and do a runing jump.  This is non-intuitive imho.<br><br>Again: The graphics are great, reminds me of a graphically superior version of Pademonium or something. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You're a wicked whipmeister for shovelling all that exe down your poor old K6's gullet - ha ha! <br>I'm surprised it didn't puke binary all over the place! <br><br>Those stars and pickups that don't appear are cube mapped so maybe your card doesn't support that properly? Do any Gems and coins appear? Or is just the fruit.<br><br>I feel like anything under 60fps isn't really playable but some people here don't seem to mind 50fps - maybe I can set this spec at an advised 1 gig with a 64 meg card minimum as I notice the 32 meg cards are falling short.<br><br>Some performance improvements are on the way - right now the map mesh is one big mesh - I'll break it up into smaller parts and let blitz do a bounding box cull, this could save about 10,000+ poly's a second which might help on slower comps. <br><br>Also the water is composed of very large polygons ( which might explain the 'pop in' problem )I think I'll tessellate it a little and making children of the parts - I figure this could really help with the slower cards as Blitz will automatically cull the water mesh.<br><br>Apart from that right now I load all scenery props in at run time and then hide and show them using a window around the player - I'm wondering if creating and deleting them would save memory and perhaps make it a bit quicker on slow machines. Anybody know about this? Does it make sense?<br><br>Also, all characters are boned and vertex tweened. I think I could simplify some enemies by just saving different poses as children and hide and show them to get the animations and perhaps save a lot of cpu time too. I think the tomatoes only really need 3 frames and don't need to be tweened.<br><br>Mike - this is just a test of my different code and stuff nestled together in one place and interacting - the game will be much more fascinating I promise! Right now Tommy just doesn't die (well he won't in the game either as it's all in his own dream world while he sleeps, he'll simply awaken) so right now he can swim his heart out under water!<br><br>The game will just be a 2d platformer. I had a two pronged attack on this one and the 2d won out as it became more feasible to finish single-handed and part-time....though a full 3d version is also on the table - just later on. <br><br>After a sniff around the forums I've learned that the AA command doesn't work properly at all which explains the uneven results. To enable it it must be set in the display properties of your GFX card ....sigh. What a freaking bummer - this should have been fixed over two yeare ago judging by the first bug reports.<br><br>Thanks for the feedback people. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
