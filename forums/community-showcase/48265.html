I just wondered how far you were thinking to take it.<br><br>As to `land-drop`, I don't know how many of these kind of games you've seen but most of them treat the land as though it is under the influence of gravity. For example, if you make an explosion that puts a circular hole in the landscape, some parts of the landscape might now overhang. You can do one of two things about that. Either you can make the overhanging bits `fall` until they come into contact with the land below, or you can leave it where it is. If you leave it where it is, you will eventually end up with pieces of land floating in the air with nothing attaching them to the `ground`.<br><br>Some games do the latter - for example Worms does that, and it tries to make it more plausible by adding a dark `background` land in the areas that are exploded. In other words, instead of just removing pixels when you get an explosion, you turn the pixels to black or some other dark graphic. That way it looks kind of as though a hole was blown in the `front` of the landscape and that there is still some land `behind` which `holds up` the floating pieces of land. It's a visual cue to make things more plausible. Otherwise you'll have land floating in the sky for no reason - which isn't very consistent given that your projectiles are susceptible to gravity. It would be confusing to see land floating when projectiles are falling.<br><br>As to the first method, where you actually treat the landscape as though it is made of `heavy` dirt which falls under certain conditions... usually this will mean that whenever you remove some dirt with an explosion you should then grab all of the particles which are directly above the explosion area and gradually animate them `falling` vertically. You usually have to do each `column` of pixels separately because some of the columns will `touch down` before the rest of them. Eventually the land falls and comes into contact with whatever land is below it, which fills in the holes. This ensures that you never have any `floating` pieces of land in the sky.<br><br>I hope that helps explain it. If you haven't seen that done in these kind of games before it might be hard to visualize. Scorched Tanks did this `land dropping`, as did Frontal Assault, but I think maybe Scorched Earth did not. I know Worms didn't. The thing with worms is they wanted to try and have `caves` or areas beneath chunks of land that you could move through without it falling on your head. They also wanted to be able to dig. It provides some extra options for gameplay.<br><br>If you are just going to have your explosions make holdes in the landscape and do nothing to try to simulate the effect of gravity on the parts of the land that are `less supported` from below, you are going to end up with land floating in the sky. I just wondered if you were planning to have that land fall or not for better effect. I've seen some algorithms that work out where the land should fall to and then draw the whole thing in its fallen state. There are others that draw the land as it falls at each Y location which is okay if you have the processing speed. Typically the graphics in these games used to be more limited by CPU power, especially on the Amiga, so have to sometimes put a limit on how sophisticated things looked. I think it was Frontal Assault that had `dirty` and `pretty` settings for how the land fell. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
