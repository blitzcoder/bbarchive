They shouldn't have to hunt him down to get an answer.  Of course, there could be any number of reasons why the emails went unanswered.  For example, an anti-spam system could have improperly filtered the emails.  Though I don't think anyone doing buisness should be using filters which could lose important emails.  It's not that difficult to sift through spam and I get over 30 a day.<br><br>Anyway, besides the whole email thing I don't see any wrongdoing here.  From what he's said, it sounds to me like he had a perfectly legitimate reason not to pay anything to either of them yet, assuming he's being truthful.<br><br>It also doesn't surprise me that Cronos's character hasn't been selling.  It's not exactly the sort of model which would fit in a wide range of games, being that it looks so unique.

I've been wanting a boned model with a decent set of animations for a while, and these look like they'll fill the bill nicely.<br><br>Any concerns I have about quality, I'll be able to fix myself (it's a *lot* easier to tweak a model or animation than having to start from scratch - there's no way that I could have produced this set myself).  Until then, these will work great as placeholders as they are - jump-starting my project.<br><br>Supplying everything in .b3d, .md2, .ms3d, and .x formats is a very nice touch, allowing anyone to use the format they prefer.  Combining all the info into one .html file is also handy, as is the inclusion of the example .bb file.  Thanks to Brandon Forrester for creating this set and to Binary-People for making all this available for such a low price!  (I don't personally know either, but I'm glad to finally have a decent set of licensed models to use - I was part of Halo's human figure buying group and was disappointed when that fell through due to people not making promised payments, but this looks like a pretty good substitute.) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
