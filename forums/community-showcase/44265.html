I've never seen these types of graphical errors before,... really bad z-buffering or something.<br><br>Anyways, since it was more playable I thought I'd add a few more comments. The arrows are pretty confusing for the most part,... I think it would make more sense for the arrows to always show direction of the turn in the view rather than relative to the car. I race RC cars, so I don't have a problem controlling from different orientations, but I never knew which way the road was going to turn based on the arrows!<br><br>Anyways,.. once again,... looking great,...

Amazing exhaust/smoke effects, nice details (lights, exhaust backfiring when going backwards). Couple of points though:<br><br>- Very hard to control, near impossible to take any corners unless you're going a snails pace on my PC. <br><br>- The shadow under the car frequently disappears into the road, typically half of it at the time, so only a very boxy shadow under either the front or back half of the car show up, also resulting in a flashing effect when going fast (you see the shadow flickering into and out of existence)  I realize that it's difficult to keep the shadow on top of an uneven road, but not having a shadow at all would actually look a lot less distracting than what it's doing now, I think.<br><br>- I assume that the 'damage' is intentional, but it did end up looking a bit weird -- after a little big, the front axis of didn't line up with the body of the car anymore, they were almost an entire wheel length too far to the front, so the tires were obviously passing straight through the metal of the front panels and such, while there wa s a big gap behind them where the wheels are normally supposed to be.<br><br>- Also, the Q-A-O-P controls are a bit awkward, hard to get used to... standard cursor keys (with the break and reverse as they are now) would be <b>much</b> preferred <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

To make it a bit easier you could make the camera zoom out quicker and more as speed increases.<br><br>Perhaps a better set of keys to be used is A and Z for throttle/brake, and &lt; and &gt; (the angular brackets, or in fact the comma and full stop) for steering. And the arrow keys as a second option. The problem with Q/A and O/P is that these keys are a bit high on the keyboard. But I think the idea of using such sets of keys as opposed to the arrow keys is not bad, because at least you can then use two hands; using just the arrow keys you have to do steering and throttle/brake with one hand and I sometimes feel that the fingers get a bit confused and it's less easy to do subtle driving. Games such as Revs and F1GP also used such keysets.<br><br>I think this is one of the most impressive game demos for Blitz that I have seen.<br><br>The 3rd person view is great too, and I didn't think the game was too hard.

I can get around the course just fine, sideways all the way, but you need to use the brakes, slow down in advance for corners, position the car correctly and start it sliding early. You can't just steam into the corner and turn.<br><br>In answer to a few points -<br><br>1st - ODE - there's no ODE used at all, it's all my own physics system.<br><br>2nd - the viewpoint - I deliberately went for a top down view because I like the old school feel. I might make the viewpoint position customisable though as it can get a bit too close to the car, but I've tried 1st and 3rd-person view and I don't like it much. The direction arrow certainly needs some work as it's very confusing when you're going the wrong way - it'll be changed to a rotating arrow linked to the orientation of the car.<br><br>3rd - the graphics - just what i had laying around at the moment, so the trees will look crap as they're meant for a 1st person viewpoint. The shadow isn't aligned to the floor yet, but it will be.<br><br>4th - the road width - it's narrow on this track, but that's the way it's meant to be - real rally tracks have very narrow lanes. However I may expand the collision area a bit so the car can slide a little way into the foliage. I uderstand that people like more room to slide the car so I might make the track wider on the corners.<br><br>5th - the glitches and poor frame rates - no idea. I have a P4 2.4 with a Radeon9800 Pro, but it runs at 60fps on my Athlon 1.4 also, which only has a Geforce3.<br><br>6th - the steering response - I'll have a play around with the physics parameters and see if I can make it more 'flicky', but I quite like the heavy feel as it forces a more technical driving style, and it means you have to use your brakes and anticipate turns in advance.<br><br>Finally - QAOP - did no one else ever have a Spectrum???
