It allows the user to control the PC with only three different keys (space bar and both mouse buttons) in order to read texts on their computer screens. The way the texts are presented and the degree the user input is delayed can be easily adjusted by the user according to their personal needs.<br><br>TextPracht has been originally designed for a person who suffers from multiple sclerosis. It has been re-designed to become individually adjustable so that other people can also benefit from it. The German version has been released on the internet in January 2004 and has already proven useful to many different people. It has now been translated into English, so that even more people can benefit from it.<br><br>Download the file at:<br><br><a href="http://www.borisbornemann.de/files/TextPrachtEng.zip" target="_blank">http://www.borisbornemann.de/files/TextPrachtEng.zip</a><br><br>or visit www.borisbornemann.de for further information. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Due to destruction of the bigger parts of his cerebellum, he is not able to fix his eyes properly, which is a common symptom of MS. He is even more handicapped concerning his motion. The space bar is the only key he can hit on the keyboard – if he really concentrates on it – since he is not quite in control of his movements. I have made many tests with him and the control with both mouse-buttons and the space bar appeared the easiest to him. Another problem is, that he cannot stroke the keys quickly but uses to hammer them down for about a second or so. That’s why the program  is so heavily delayed.<br><br>“ I also thought the mouse buttons operated opposite to what a westerner would expect in the text reading section.”<br><br>That is true though. My client said this, too. It should be changed in later versions.<br><br>“The menu itself is very slow and unresponsive on my machine.” <br><br>As described above, this is done on purpose. The program is deliberately delayed (delay is adjustable, too, as you might have recognized).<br><br>“Also, why is there no end of line word wrapping? “ <br><br>Some users adjust the text so huge, that there is not even ONE word on the screen at once, because they are so heavily handicapped in vision. End of line word wrapping would be senseless.<br><br>“I would also recommend putting in a quick ESC key exit.”<br><br>It is specially designed to work with three keys. As with my client, many people are unable to hit the ESC – key.<br><br>Your sincerely<br><br>Boris Bornemann <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
