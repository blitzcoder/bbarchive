Fine...fine...Hit the 'F3' key to toggle JARENZ off.  I do have that included in the documentation and in the game About screens, but I am open to suggestions on making key controls more clear.<br><br>Grisu: Thanks for the suggested changes.  I have now added:<br>- apptitle<br>- full png conversion (font bitmaps included - thanks for catching this for me)<br>- UPX compressed .exe file (wow, this is great)<br>- zipping the final installer (makes good sense, why didn't I think of this?)<br><br>Could you please help me with adding proper installer images?  What do you suggest, and how is the best way to do it?  I am pretty new to Innosetup.<br><br>Also, Grisu, the windowed mode is going to be a little tricky because of the way I've written the game...Some aspects will need to be modified and I won't be able to make this change instantly.  I definitely recognize it might be a popular request, and if this is the case, I will try to get the update out there faster.<br><br>Thanks all, please keep it coming.<br><br>-Gk2k<br><br>Edit: I am also aware that the music keeps playing when the program is minimized and am working on figuring out how to change this.  I will probably post to the n00b area for some feedback on this issue. :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But thank you very much for the PNG optimisation information and the Inno Setup help.<br><br>Nomen luni-<br><br>I appreciate your thoughts.  "Despise" is a pretty strong word, but I appreciate your criticism and can understand how it can become repetitive - perhaps a bit overpowering.  This is fixed in the full version as it loops between four music tracks and adds a nice variety.  I think you would find the other tracks, for example, more appealing.  The track I left in the demo version I thought was most suitable for the intro / title / short demo.  Also, instructions on disabling music are found under "About."<br><br>I take no credit for the sound fx, though I guarantee they are freeware.  If there was any room for doubt regarding this, it would be changed immediately.  But I am 99.9% certain.  I made the graphics and wrote the music (though I'm not sure I should be admitting to the demo music) ;) <br><br>Level 2 is the first demo level.  As you progress you will find that it jumps from level 2, 5, to 9, 13, and then 18.  I wanted a nice sampling of what the game has to offer.<br><br>I am happy you are enjoying it enough to have another shot, even without the music.  Thanks. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I actually read the instructions before I played the game which may have told me how but couldn't remember by then.  A hint dialog on the first level you have to do that would be good.<br><br>Well done for finishing a game!  Takes a lot of drive to do that.<br><br>It's nice and fast and smooth but I found it quite hard on the second demo level with those balls flying round everywhere.  The graphics are a bit "programmer art" and the music could be better.  Also you could do with better fonts than Courier or MS Sans-serif or whatever it is in game.  You know the yes no dialogs?  It's hard to see which option is highlighted.  They are both different colours but which is the "highlight" colour?  As a new person to the game I didn't know until I chose the wrong option.  Perhaps this could be clearer.<br><br>The installer and uninstall worked great thanks.  It's good you have a nag screen on the way out and the game is priced cheaply.  To be honest though it may be hard to sell as it feels say 5-10 years old.  With a complete graphical overhall and lots of attention paid to polish (even to such things as the loading screen) and making sure the full game takes 2-3 hours to complete you could put the price up to a normal $19.95 and get it out there.  However, you may be better as treating this as training for your next bigger and better project.  That's my 2 cents anyway. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
