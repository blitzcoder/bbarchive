A few of you may know that I previously released a game called <b>Rockfall - The Return</b> for the PC that was written in Blitz3D.  Since the release of BlitzMax it was always my intention to release a version for the Apple Mac as well.  Since BlitzMax is cross-platform, I decided to give the whole game a bit of a face-lift and remove some of the more annoying features of the game, so re-releasing it for the PC as well.  Not really sure what to do about the Linux market (if there is one), but since it's not much effort, there's a Linux version as well.<br><br>Anyway, the game is now at a playable state and I would like the community to give it a bit of a test run and let me know how it performs and what you think of the game.  For those that don't know, it's my take on the Repton series of games that were released for the 8 bit computers of the 1980s (although they have now been remade for the PC).<br><br><b>SCREENSHOT:</b><br><br><img src="http://www.sos-software.co.uk/assets/screens/full/r4dx/r4dx.jpg"><br><br><b>DOWNLOADS:</b><br><br><a href="http://www.sos-software.co.uk/misc/r4dx_setup.exe" target="_blank">Windows installer version (5.45MB)</a> - (Vista users must install from an admin account)<br><a href="http://www.sos-software.co.uk/misc/Rockfall_DX_Test.zip" target="_blank">Winodws ZIP version (4.90MB)</a><br><br><a href="http://www.sos-software.co.uk/misc/Rockfall_DX_Test.dmg" target="_blank">Mac (Universal binary, 6.51MB)</a><br><br><a href="http://www.sos-software.co.uk/misc/Rockfall_DX_Test.tar.gz" target="_blank">Linux (4.78MB)</a><br><br>If you're a Windows Vista user, please try the installer version, as I want to make sure that everything works as it should on other people's systems.  Cheers.<br><br><b>NOTES:</b><br><br>Display settings: The game should detect your desktop aspect ratio and hertz settings and find the closest matching resolution.  It is limited to a screen of between 480 and 600 pixels high.  You can change display settings in the game as well, should you want to.<br><br>Audio: Vista should default to OpenAL, or DirectSound if that fails.  XP will use FreeAudio.  The Windows version will let you change it should you want to from within the game.  Mac uses FreeAudio and does not give you the option of using another driver (no need).<br><br>Profiles: The game will create a profile based on your user name upon first starting the game.  You can edit or create additional profiles from the Start Game menu (you should be able to access all profiles from all user accounts regardless of OS - please report if this proves not to be the case).<br><br>Levels: The levels included have been ported from a set that was meant for release for Rockfall 3, an Atari ST game, not a PC one.  The default set for the final game is being worked on, so I decided to include these as you'll see most of the game elements far more quickly.  As such, thinigs may seem to get difficult a lot quicker than they will in the final game, although you may have more time than you're supposed to at this stage as well.<br><br>Music: Will not be included in the final game.  The final music has not been written yet, and the included track is for testing purposes only.  It's also been sampled from the title track I used in Rockfall 2 (from the ST again), which is why it sounds more than a little retro.  The final game should have around 8 tunes.<br><br><b>VERY BRIEF INSTRUCTIONS</b><br><br>The aim of the game should be obvious to any Repton or Boulderdash fan, but anyway...<br><br>To complete a level you must collect all of the gems, kill/trap any creatures, and use all transporters, all before your time runs out.  Some levels also require you to flip a switch to open the exit, which only becomes active once all other tasks have been completed.<br><br>Bonus points and time are awarded for the successful completion of a level.  Any time bonus will be lost if you die on a level, so be careful.<br><br>Also, when you die, the game has an auto-play feature.  It basically takes control after you die so that you don't have to remember how you got as far in the level as you did.  You simply take over from wherever you like by hitting a direction key.  While auto-play is active, press the 1,2 and 3 keys to control how fast it runs (it will drop to 1 again should it get near the point where you died).  You can disable this feature on a per profile basis in the Preferences menu under Controls.<br><br><b>CONTROLS:</b><br><br>Selectable and reconfigurable from within the game.<br><br>Keys: Arrows to move, Space for map, Q for suicide and Esc to quit.<br><br>Mouse: Move direction pointer with mouse and press LMB to move in that direction.<br><br>Joypad (must be plugged in before starting the game): Directions to move, button 0 to show map.<br><br><br><br>And that's basically it.  Please let me know what you think of the game, how well it peforms (giving OS and specs), and whether there were any problems (and any way to reproduce them if possible).<br><br>One final note is that not all of the menu options will do anything for the simple reason I haven't coded them yet.  Also, as I have not implemeted the Pause menu yet, the game will continue to run should you switch windows or Alt-Tab.<br><br>Pressing F11 will reveal various bits of debug info, including FPS, which should stay around the refresh rate of your monitor (although you can turn VSync off if you really want to).<br><br>Have fun. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Glad you liked it.  Did you manage to test it on a Vista system as well as your MacBook, as I know you were part of that whole other thread?<br><br>As for the mouse button, yep, I can add that as I find myself hitting the mouse button even when I am playing with keys.  The mouse button does actually work, but you have to be using the mouse control method.  I'll change it so that it works when you're using keys and joypad as well.<br><br>As for the green key, there's two of them on the first level.  The first one is a trap, so cannot be collected.  The second is just a little bit later on.  Only one key of each colour is needed to open all the safes of that colour.<br><br>I used fixed rate logic timing for the timing, no delta.

Yeah, sorry about the little trap so early on.  Things will be a lot easier in the proper default set - not even any boulders!  I found that anything lower than 200fps for the logic didn't yield smooth results, so I use 200 as a minimum.  Sometimes go higher if the game doesn't have a lot of logic going on.<br><br>@CS_TBL - Can you remember what settings the game was trying to use, including the refresh rate?  Do you know if it was the resolution your monitor had trouble with, or the hertz setting.  Would it fail if I used 60hz for example?

Maybe I should treat 5:4 resolutions as 4:3, and allow the user to change it later in preferences if they want to.<br><br>What the game does at start up is determine the aspect ratio of your monitor by using the user's desktop resolution.  So even if a user has their desktop as 1280x1024 on a 4:3 monitor, the program will think the monitor is 5:4 and not try to set 640x480, but the closest match.  In your case, the monitor didn't like it, but this may have had something to do with the hertz setting, as this is also taken from the desktop.  I might try using a default of 60hz and see if this makes a difference.  I decided to use the desktop hertz setting as default, as any lower resolution should support it.<br><br>The program does check the availability of the final selection before switching.  If it fails it tries the same res, but at 60hz.  If that fails it goes to 640x480 @ 60hz.  For some reason your drivers appear to be reporting back combinations that are not actually available.<br><br>I'll sort something out, as all I want to do is have the game start in a widescreen format on widescreen monitors, and 4:3 on CRTs, etc. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The default background music isn't my taste though, it starts getting old real quick<br><br>3) the uninstall feature ran into some problems, saying it could not remove all files/folders.<br>The "log" button in the uninstaller returned this:<br><br><div class="quote"> C:\Program Files\SOS Software\Rockfall DX (WIP)\Data\Profiles<br>C:\Program Files\SOS Software\Rockfall DX (WIP)\Data<br> <br></div><br><br>but when I checked out the 'SOS Software' folder manually, I found the following:<br><br><div class="quote"> <br>C:\Program Files\SOS Software\Rockfall DX (WIP)\Data<br>C:\Program Files\SOS Software\Rockfall DX (WIP)\UnInstall.log<br>C:\Program Files\SOS Software\Rockfall DX (WIP)\un_r4dx_setup_20042.exe<br>C:\Program Files\SOS Software\Rockfall DX (WIP)\Data\config.ini<br>C:\Program Files\SOS Software\Rockfall DX (WIP)\Data\Profiles<br>C:\Program Files\SOS Software\Rockfall DX (WIP)\Data\Profiles\Administrator.prof<br> <br></div><br><br>So... It appears that your uninstaller didn't take all files into consideration that are created later on by the game itself. That's a fairly major issue, since people (rightfully) expect a program to clean up after itself when uninstalling.<br><br>4) The reoslution selector gave like 30+ options, but many of the 'major' ones that one might expect (like 1024x768) were missing. Not that big of a deal, except you may want to consider breakup up the resolution, color &amp; refreshrate options into three seperate selectors so you don't spend forever cycling through the list to find out that the one you're looking for doesn't exist.<br><br>You could even make the 16 bit / 32 bit color a radio button. (e.g. 'thousands of colors' &lt;-&gt; 'millions of colors')<br><br>Or you could use a pull-down menu rather than the current way of iterating through the list of resolutions, that way it's a lot faster to see if the resolution you're looking for is even an option without manually having to flip through the entire list.<br><br>I did see some options that I had no idea that my system even supported. :-? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Your points, one by one...<br><br>1) Great.  Nice to know it was nice and smooth.<br><br>2) Worked as expected, FreeAudio should be the default under XP.  As stated in the original thread the current music will not even be present in the final game - it's test music.  The final score is being written by a good friend of mine, which is not ready at this point in time.<br><br>3) I'll look into this and see if there's an option to force the removal of all folders.  I don't think it's as major an issue as you make it out to be though.  If a user decides to re-install, their saved games, profiles, etc are still there.<br><br>4) Any screen resolution that has a height of more than 600 pixels has been hidden on purpose for the simple reason that I cannot allow anyone to see too much of the level at once, as this would introduce an unfair advantage.  It's only there so that people can select a suitable resolution for their monitor, from a 4:3 or widescreen point of view.  Much of this is automated from the initial start, so a user should not have to worry about this.  Plus, it's not that easy to split up the res from the refresh rate, as not all refresh rates are available for all resolutions.  If this option is used at all, it will only be used once.<br><br>What options are you not aware of that you system supported? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

May not be final, but it's nicer.<br><br>The Windows installer now asks you whether you want to remove the configuration file and profiles when you uninstall the game.<br><br>Screen modes are now filtered for 4:3, 5:4, 16:9 and 16:10 resolutions only.  Upon initial start-up, 5:4 is treated as 4:3, which should solve the problem that CS_TBL was having.  You can still select a 5:4 resolution from the Preferences menu later if you do actually have a 5:4 monitor.<br><br>I've also hacked a fix for Vista not being detected if the game is launched from the installer.

I'm a big fan of Boulderdash clones, especially ones that have a lot more features than the original! :)<br><br>A couple of points though:<br><br>- On the majority of games of this genre, if you cause a rock to fall, you can 'keep ahead' of it and step left or right to avoid it when a gap becomes present. I notice here that if you set a rock free and move downwards (even if there's free space below you) you get bumped on the head instantly. Fair enough if this is the intended idea, I guess it'll just take a little getting used to, and means that puzzles need approaching in a different way. ;)<br><br>- May be something to do with the last sentence of my first point, but I found the first level a little difficult.<br><br>Apart from that, it's shaping up to be a brilliant game, and the graphics and sound can't be questioned.<br><br>I'm on a Centrino 1.73ghz / 512mb Dell Laptop (1920x1200) ATI Mobility Radeon X300, running XP (sp2) and I experience no graphical or sound problems at all settings.<br><br>Hope these comments help, and best of luck with the game! ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The game is actually based on Repton, so is a lot more puzzle based.  I never really liked how you could outrun boulders in Boulderdash - felt a bit like cheating.<br><br>These won't be the final levels.  The set I'm using here are a part-developed set that was oringally for the Atari ST version of Rockfall 3.  The actual default set starts out a lot easier, with the first couple of levels not even having any boulders.  The different elements are introduced over something like 20-odd levels, so the learning curve is a lot gentler than those here.  I simply chose these levels because the different elements come into play a lot sooner, for the sake of testing and feedback.<br><br>Glad you like the graphics and the sound.<br><br>Nice to know that you didn't have any problems with graphics or sound.  Out of interst, did the game default to 800x500 to match your 16:10 monitor?<br><br>Keep the comments coming, they are all useful. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

These are then checked every game cycle and killed if no longer needed.
