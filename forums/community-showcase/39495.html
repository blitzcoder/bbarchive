I thought it had locked.  Why not put some sort of indicator to show that something is happening?<br><br>2)  When I quit the game it didn't actually quit it just stayed active on the task bar.<br><br>3)  Are you sure the fade to black routine is fading to black completely, it appears that I can still see a faint trace of the image...<br><br>4)  It might be a good idea to 'hide' your data (ie gfx files) by using a file packer like molebox or Terabits excellent free Pak util.<br><br>5) You could shave an awful lot off your game size by using the free UPX exe compressor and converting your bmp files to png.  For example I converted the credits1.bmp to png and it went from 901kb to 86kb, quite a saving.  What file format are you using for your sound effects / music?  If its not .ogg why not? <br><br>6)  What on earth is in that huge bins.ddp file?<br><br>7)  It would be nicer if the boat had more momentum.  They are in water afterall, at the moment they don't 'feel' right.<br><br>These are just my opinions and are not meant to be critism but thoughts on how I would improve the game.<br><br>Good luck and keep up the good work... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Of course, it brought up your web site after the game ended, so maybe that was your intention to let the music play while the player browsed your web site??<br><br>-And the rankings screen had some serious slow down.  Are you using 2D text over 3D?<br><br>-I once got to an area of MeltWater where I flew over a hill and basically fell out of the world.<br><br>-There are some graphical glitches in the rock formations in the latter parts of Sea Cave.<br><br>-The player placing (Pos. 1/6) is still updated even after the finish line.  It should show the placing that you earned, not the current placing.<br><br><br>The <b>goods</b> and the <b>bads</b>:<br><br>-Level designs that I saw so far were actually quite interesting and worked well for the game.  The shortcuts fit in to the game well, and I liked that you could pretty much boat anywhere you wanted to (even if it was a bad idea).<br><br>-The oasis level background needs something to spice it up.  It was rather blocky.<br><br>-I did find the end of the MeltWater level extremely frustrating (although cool looking).  Trying to race through those floating bergs at high speed was damn near impossible.  ESPECIALLY considering that the collision radius for the boats felt way too large and caused more bangups than should be happening (can't fit through tight areas).<br><br>-I really liked the water reflections.  I ended up playing the game with them on and turning off other features instead to get a decent framerate.<br><br>-You have some cool boat designs.<br><br>-The abilities of the boats were definitely noticeable while playing the game.<br><br>-The boosts are very short lived.  In my personal opinion, I think they should last at least twice as long.<br><br>-The abilities of some of the boats don't match the boat types.  For instance, a boat with a dish shaped bottom should slide better than one with a split hull.  Also, I would expect a split hull boat to corner better.  But worst of all, the hovercraft definitely should not be the fastest boat (are you serious?)<br><br>-Most sounds in the game are OK.<br><br>-The "Time Extension" phrase gets old really quick.<br><br>-I really digged the music.<br><br>-The Countdown (3,2,1,Go!) and Time Extension is hard to see on some levels.<br><br><br>My <b>specs</b>:<br>2.53 GHz Pentium 4, 512 MB DDR SDRAM, 533 MHz FSB <br>Nvidia GeForce FX 5700LE OPTIMA AGP4X w/ 128MB DDR RAM using driver 6.14.10.5664<br>running on a dual-monitor setup (two monitors, one card)<br>Windows XP Pro (Media Center Edition) Version 2002 w/ SP2 - DirectX 9.0b <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

For being a shareware version you didn't put much effort into polish.  Also you didn't bother to fix a number of things I suggested in the past... <br><br><div class="quote"> -And the rankings screen had some serious slow down. Are you using 2D text over 3D?  <br></div>I see you didn't bother to change this...<br><br><div class="quote"> -The player placing (Pos. 1/6) is still updated even after the finish line. It should show the placing that you earned, not the current placing.  <br></div>I see you didn't fix this either...<br><br><br><div class="quote"> -The oasis level background needs something to spice it up. It was rather blocky. <br></div>No noticeable change there...<br><br><div class="quote"> -I did find the end of the MeltWater level extremely frustrating (although cool looking). Trying to race through those floating bergs at high speed was damn near impossible. ESPECIALLY considering that the collision radius for the boats felt way too large and caused more bangups than should be happening (can't fit through tight areas). <br></div>It feels like you actually worked on this, however, I can't help but complain how the collision response works in the game.  If you are traveling fairly straight-forwards (in regards to the wall alongside of you) and you just barely touch the wall, the boat will slam way over and slow down considerably.  This makes it unfair and just plain frustrating...<br><br><div class="quote"> -The boosts are very short lived. In my personal opinion, I think they should last at least twice as long. <br></div>Your game, your choice, but the sure do feel short...<br><br><div class="quote"> -The abilities of some of the boats don't match the boat types. For instance, a boat with a dish shaped bottom should slide better than one with a split hull. Also, I would expect a split hull boat to corner better. But worst of all, the hovercraft definitely should not be the fastest boat (are you serious?) <br></div>Looks like nothing changed here... <br><br>Like I said in the beginning, I'm surprised and disappointed at what I saw... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
