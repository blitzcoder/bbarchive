This game was written in BlitzMax using the Grey Alien BlitzMax Game Framework.<br><br><a href="http://www.injoygames.com/oz/play_oz.htm" target="_blank">http://www.injoygames.com/oz/play_oz.htm</a> (~20Mb)<br><br><a href="http://www.injoygames.com/oz/" target="_blank">http://www.injoygames.com/oz/</a> (find out more and BUY it here)<br><br>I was the programmer of the game and it was produced by Alex Ahlund who is based in the US (it was his idea, he contacted me in March).  Two associates of his did the art, one did the painted backgrounds and one did the 3D rendering.  I did the particles :-)  A classical musician was also hired to do the rather lush music.<br><br><img src="http://www.greyaliengames.com/oz/title.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.injoygames.com/oz/screenshot1.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.injoygames.com/oz/screenshot2.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.injoygames.com/oz/screenshot3.jpg"><br><br>You can see that the graphics are rather nice and combined with the smooth programming and special effects (particles, fades, sliding UI etc), plus the very popular Oz theme, we are hoping that this will be a big success.  It's already been accepted by 3 major portals (going live tonight on one) with more in the pipeline.<br><br>The game has me taken 7 months in total.  However 3 months were just making the framework, which is reuseable, and learning BMax (I used BPlus for 16 months before so it wasn't too hard).  And 4 months making the actual game.  However, I wasn't working entirely full time, although it was my main focus - I had many other things going on at the same time.<br><br>As a matter of interest, the team that the producer put together is an Internet-based team. I live in the UK and he and the artists live in the US. I think the musician lives in the US but neither of us met him, we just heard his stuff and went "Wow, we must use him!". I have never even *spoken* to the producer - in fact I don't even know what he looks like! Everything was done via email and MSN (despite me trying to get him on skype, haha). I feel that this is proof that distributed teams *can* work if you choose the right people as he did (although I was doubtless a thorn in his side a few times ;-))<br><br>Anyway, please let me know what you think.  If you find any bugs, we'll fix them, but we can't really make any big changes now because it's been released but I'd still be interested in hearing any suggestions that you may have.  There's plenty of stuff that we didn't have time to add in and finalise and there are things that I'd have done differently given a choice - but overall I'm extremely happy with the end result.  I hope you like it!<br><br>Also, thanks to BRL for BMax, it's really good. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's useful the first time, but on each of the subsequent levels, there is not much point until the background changes (on level 6).  A friend of mine noted the same thing.  The Click Anywhere thing was good in a couple of other pro match-3 games which showed the picture, then zoomed into it and showed a new one but this happened every level...but in hindsight, less useful in Oz.<br><br>Warren:  Thanks for you interest. The framework isn't optimised to make match-3s, in fact there is no match-3 code in it.  The framework has been used to make AOTMG demo (a shoot em up), Sudoku Maya Gold, and Oz (a match-3), plus plenty of other people are making all sorts of games with it.  The framework gives you tons of useful stuff to use with *any* game like menu systems, sprites, particle effects etc.  If you have any more questions, please feel free to ask them in the new framework thread.

Party on :-D<br><br>QuickSilva: Many thanks for your kind words.  I said it would be good didn't I ;-)  Well, being my third match-3 it ought to be - BlitzMax is definitely the way forward.  I think this really has a lot going for it too, and I honestly think that it's one of the best match-3s made to date.  The graphics are great but I see what you are saying about hand drawn all the way through - art continuity is important.  I think we got this right in Easter Bonus, but there were a few areas in Oz I'd have liked to tweak if there was time (but there wasn't).  However, lots of games doing well have 3D rendered stuff and it looks pro and maybe gives an interesting juxtaposition with the hand drawn stuff in-game.  My next game (Holiday Bonus) is actually all 3D rendered, although in two different styles.  So we'll see if that works.  Early signs seem good!  Yes, I'm hoping for some more framework sales as a result of this (already made a few), because Oz really does really show it off.  Anyway, I look forward to seeing your next game soon as you know I love your artwork :-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Actually I know I will be as something rather cool has happened, but more about that later when it pans out.<br><br>AngelDaniel: Thanks (and don't forget that I was part of great team).  Basically 2 years ago I got Blitz Plus and now I've got a top 10 game at BFG!  It just takes some dedication and the will to succeed, plus a bit of skill thrown in the mix.  I'm a very determined person and I like to do what I say I'm going to do.  Plus the Universe helps me out every day with little things and big things that all move me towards my goals.  I hope that people can see this Oz game and realise that BMax is a totally viable tool for making a top notch game.  I realised this when I saw Inca Quest and later on Temple of Tangram - both really polished excellent games.  I hope that Oz is in the same league.  Anyway, you don't *have* to make a game to sell, it's still damn good fun just programming and creating, that's what got me into this in the first place, I just want to do it for a job now, that's all :-D <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
