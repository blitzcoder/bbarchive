I don't care if someone posted an FPS demo that consisted out of 3 cubes and a ball and I'd encourage him/her to improve upon it and become a better coder. I WILL however comment on everyones work based upon their skill level or the skill level they believe they have. Some months ago I coded someone a framework for a text based lemonade selling game, just because I saw the kid needed some good examples. I didn't flame him because he was making a puny text game! I just saw him as a potentialy good coder that was just trying to get a hang of things. I still remember the few persons that helped me when I started programing 3D games and I'm very glad to see most of the people here are nice and helpfull to people who still have lots to learn. Seriously, keep it up people, our great community is one of the things that makes blitz so strong, a little competition isn't a bad thing either as long as we keep it friendly.<br><br>As you probably know I'm not particularly fond of Halo as I have made clear in topics posted by him every now and then. This disliking towards him, is based on his behaviour on the forums over the past 2 years or so. I feel that I accurately describe Halo's character and abilities by saying he's a reasonably skilled coder who has a massive inferiority complex and therefore wants to feel and act like he's a god amongst mortals, better then anybody else. He may never realise this and continue to feel this way for the rest of his life, in which case I pitty him. The only thing to get a person to let go of this kind of attitude is usualy when someone who is more skilled then they are in the specific field they focus these feelings upon (in Halo's case coding games/engines), becomes friends with them and the person in question starts to admire them and realises it's not a bad thing to be less skilled in something then someone else. I’m sure I haven't been very helpfull in these aspects towards Halo and I'm equaly sure some people on this forum will wonder what the hell I'm on about when I post this. ;) But I realy hope Halo will get over this someday, he could be a good, likeable coder and he's done some quality stuff before. However his behaviour on this forum over the last years has not exactly made him popular and I feel sorry for the people who truely want to be "like him". Value his coding skills for what they mean to you, but don't strive to become a god, there are no gods on this planet, just people, people with hopes and dreams, trying to make them come true. If you’re determined to be the absolute best (in any skill or discipline), then that's a sure fire way to be dissapointed for the rest of your life! With 6 billion people on this rock to compete with, coming out on top is a gift as much as it is an achievement.<br><br>When I look around in the gamedevelopment community as well as every day life, I see people that aren’t where they should be, I see people with skills, visions and abilities, people who are working simple deskjobs yet have more vision then the people that are managing their managers, programmers that can tell more about a piece of software by running it then the coders know for themselves and people with the soft-skills to manage large teams of people toting around coffee! Have you ever asked yourself why? Why do some completely uncapable people hold such high positions and society? Why are some of the more hardworking/gifted people forced to work in service of these people and in positions that are far below what they are realy capable off? Isn’t it all about skill, determination, hard work? No, it is not, those are just small factors in the equation. The largest factor is still dumb old luck, being at the right place at the right time, meeting the right people. etc.<br><br>So when any of you or I myself get that chance to reach something in life, I hope that’s something we’ll remember, making it to the top doesn’t make you the greatest. More likely then not there’s a 100 people out there that are better at what you do, then you are yourself. You we’re just luckier!<br><br>Best of luck on your further ventures Halo…<br><br>I hope this post is of some help to everyone here! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That's why people are a bit more hostile towards him. I don't have to jump on him because he did something incredibly amazing, because frankly, he didn't. If he hadn't had such a forum history however you would have seen, for example like when filax posted his terrain screenshots, that the community would have responded in a much friendlier way. Don't be worried about the Halo flaming, it's no more then natural. It started around the time he declared himself god and told people that the blitz community wouldn't have gotten anywhere if not for him. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Saying things such as "...because associating myself with this community will make us look bad..." etc. are bound to put people on the defensive and feed hostility. But when we let our anger get the better of us, and post inflamatory comments, and make statements that we know would piss him off, we are no better than him. I'd like to see this community realize that if he calls us names, or insults our work, so what? Ignoring people that are distasteful to us is the worst thing we can do to them.
