Theres alot of inertia, and im not sure if pressing right mouse to stop and toggle up/down rotation is a good idea. Id prefer that the turret moves in all directions without a toggle for up/down. <br><br>You could keep the sense of inertia but if I stop moving the mouse, Id like the turret to stop too and not have to swing the mouse the other way to stop it(or press rm). Im guessing that youve play tested it so much your a demon with the controls by now! but I give a game 10mins to get used to the controls and if I havent got the basics by then its escape and delete time ;)<br><br>I like the idea with the energy distribution ie., more power to the engines, less to weapons etc., but again I thought this was abit slow. I was thinking you could keep the precise way of doing it but also for the 'heat of the moment' situations you could have 4 or 5 presets (maybe 1-4) keys or summin. One press of the button sets the tank up automatically for equal distributaion/more manouverability less fire power/for fire power less manouverability etc. etc.<br><br>Already looking forward to the next version! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

On my first game it took me a while to figure out what I was doing, and by the time I got out into the open arena there was already a full-scale war going on... which looked and sounded very impressive! I especially like the look of the heavy cannon fire. And anyone who's ever watched Tron will feel right at home. Also great view of the battlefield from the lifters.<br><br>Controls - I agree with Rigz. A little less inertia, and drop the right-button to look up and down. <br><br>I'm also not quite sure what I'm supposed to do... should I go solo and get the blue key, or is there a way to coordinate with the other red tanks? Anytime I shoot my way into the blue base I get blown to pieces once I'm inside.<br><br><br>Finally, the re-start sequence is a little lengthy. It's cool the first time, but got on my nerves quickly.

On the second time I ran the demo, I looked up and down a little and fired some practice shots before driving forwards, and having it freeze up.  After half a second of moving forwards, it freezes up the game.  I'm running on P4 2.26ghz, GF4ti4600, 1gb RAM, winXP pro, 1600x1200.<br><br>What feedback I can give... maybe have some better subtlety of vertical tank adjustment, perhaps move the turret in clicks or have a numerical gauge (bleh, I don't like the idea of a numerical gauge though, I prefer the simplicity of the look you have).  Some means of knowing how far you've moved the turret would be cool though, that's why I thought clicks.  You move it up, and it clicks audibly 5 times... you know that if it overshoots, you move it down so that it clicks 2 times, it would help refining shots.  <br><br>Love the visuals ^_^ <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This makes it more like a tank, and less like a FPS.   You set the height, judge the distance, and use that as a reference point as you move about.  Dropping the right-click would negate that, and mean that the time you spent judging your aim and distance would have been lost.   This is similar to the tactics in Scorched Earth, Worms, and similar tank games.  I like the turret height control. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This does mean that in close quarters, it's a slower matter (than an fps), to turn and aim.<br><br>Also, it is important that turret yaw is locked while the player adjusts gun pitch hence the RMB. <br><br>The inertia is so that the player can slew and aim without extravagant mouse movements (hence the inertia) and the player can(with good mouse control) make fine tuning for distant shots.<br><br>However, will look at tightening the inertia and how RMB/no RMB stacks up. <br><br>Agree that the power distribution needs more work and hotkeys for quick distribution. There's also a bug in there that allows you to go to 100% engines I've found - call it a debug feature ;-) <br><br><br>Midnight<br><br>Can you co-ordinate with the other tanks? Short answer is no,  they do have some AI to stick close to the player but it's not overriding. One idea is 'reputation' i.e. gain enough reputation and you'll be more popular with your NPC teammates and more inclined to protect you. I'm undecided about adding teammate commands - I feel they can complicate a straight forward action game and if they're only done simply, they can seem kind of an afterthought/incomplete. Not sure. Perhaps something like Xwing Alliance's command options would be ok.<br><br>You do need to get to the blue hub to grab the blue key and take it back to your hub - so you'll have to deal to the inner turrets.<br><br>Agree, the exit/restart is too lengthy - need an option to escape the game immediately (and some optimisation no doubt)<br><br>'enter/hijack an enemy tank (can you?).'

I gusss it must be some sort of problem running at 1600x1200.  The reason I run it at 1600x1200 is because that's the native resolution of my LCD display.  <br><br>I think there is too much inertia on the tank movement, as real tanks have very stop-start movement in real life (very little acceleration - they just start moving at the set speed, and stop immediately - at least that's how it looks on TV ^_^).  However I'm sure the controls are about getting used to them more than anything.  Some tutorial levels to get used to the controls would be a good idea (think Crazy Taxi's Crazy Box).  <br><br>Looks cool :)  I don't like the pixelated font though, it turns into a mess when scaled, and doesn't match the sleek uncomplicated visuals of the rest of the game.  A square font would be okay, but the gaps between the pixels seem like overkill.  <br><br>Another suggestion - how about a visual aid to see where previous shots have hit?  Some sort of marking on the floor, or something.  Other tank games use this, and you can use your missed shots to judge your new shots.  It also acts as a warning to other players :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The mouse control only swings the turret left and right but when u fire the gun the longer you keep your finger on the left mouse button the higher it fires the bullet. You could have a bar or something as a visual gauge. You could even keep the other method, I don't think holding the mouse method would have any advantages, it might just make it easier to control for the beginner.<br><br>I must admit I played FPSs quite heavily so my opinion is prolly bias lol. But even so too many buttons to press cant be a good thing. I loved scorched tanks, that brings back a few memories, but that was turn based anyway, as are many 'turret tank games' so you could take as long as you want to line your shot up. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I think it is on the difficult side though! This may be caused by the enemies being very good at aiming, and the player (me) not being very good at it.<br><br>I had some difficulty adjusting the height of the shot. I would click the right mouse button and move up or down, but nothing happens. So I move up or down some more (the mouse I mean...) and then suddenly the barrel *does* move, but more than I wanted it to. So it's the fine-tuning of the height of the shot that I found very difficult. (Especially since in the meanwhile the opponents seemed to have less trouble on this aspect of the game! ;))<br><br>You mentioned wanting to keep the control method like that so it wouldn't be like an FPS and more like getting the right angle (like in the "artillery" type of games). But I think that even if you give the player free mouse control over both horizontal *and* vertical adjustment, you will still have this element of judging the right angle, it will just be easier to apply (and thus more fun).<br><br>But all in all, a great effort! I also like the intro, zooming across the grid. When it stops zooming and the actual menu appears, the angle is adjusted a bit; maybe it would look better if it stayed at the same angle, if you know what I mean. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Sigh.<br><br>Having said that, I have a suspicion though that some of you are approaching this from a wholly FPS perspective (and it's a tank game ;-). There will be a FPS portion to the game, so my feeling is that the tank control would be different.<br><br>Again, my intention with the RMB control was to offer a (tanklike?) deliberateness - where the player is not moving the mouse much at all to slew and aim -  and the turret does not turn immediately (think Tron's tank). If you're jerking the mouse or lifting it up and 'scrabbling' with it, then you're actually fighting against the control scheme.<br><br>But, maybe I could whip up a small exe which offers several control options and people could vote for what they like..<br><br>Also, this arena level might be a little misleading as most of the levels will be more maze like. <br><br>Foppy<br>Training level/s - agree. The arena's a (somewhat) steep learning curve. Also, need to implement an easy/normal/hard/insane feature that adjusts player shields/shooting etc..<br><br>And if there's laser tanks about, don't get out in the open with them or at least get up on a slope so it's harder for them to aim. And don't stay still (or the cap ship'll cap you)<br><br>To adjust gun pitch, hold the RMB button down (but you're probably doing that)<br>(and I'm surprised that it runs on a C64!)<br><br>Andy<br>Control style option - Yes, although play balancing might be difficult. If 'arcade' control allows the player to zap things at a much quicker rate vs a slower yaw/pitch control, then level design can be a problem. Think I'd rather settle on one control scheme only. <br><br>AI doesn't feel 'threatened' - agree, I've spread the AI refresh over a number of frames/seconds. But need to give enemies close to the player a higher refresh rate and also add a 'sightings report' if you (or another unit) collide. AI dev is like an endless hall of mirrors.<br><br>Maybe there's a mem leak. I also had some trouble with units sitting in inaccessible map squares and repeatedly trying to pathfind (and hogging resources) - that could be it.

I told you I would be the first to buy it when it's done, so you can imagine that I enjoy playing it already...<br><br>What kind of tactics do you believe that the player will use? That could answer some questions about the controls...<br><br>I drive at full speed, make few corrections to the base, and fire at anything which is within 5-10 squares distance. To do that, I keep the gun elevated just a few degrees, so that I can hit anything within 5-10 squares distance... The only time where I use elevation, is to take out the sentries guarding the enemy entrance from the other side of the arena(to avoid their fire).<br><br>some of my problems with the controls are that they are not consistant... Often, the controls spin out of control and the gun turns halfway around the tank, even when I apply very little rotation with the mouse... <br><br>It sounds like you have done alot of thinking about the controls, which is good, but it also sounds like you just don't want to change anything about the controls. That's cool, but if the control is not intuitive, then the player will have great dificulty getting into the game. I am not advocating an FPS style control system with no dampening etc... To be able both raise and rotate the gun without LMB would be nice combined with the dampening of the gunrotation and would make it more intuitive, as well as retaining the dificulty of the game... As I play it on the arena at least, I rarely use gun elevation at all... If it was more intuitive, then I might be able to develop long range tactics instead of the short range tactics that I am forced to use now... Unless ofcourse that is how you want the game to be played!<br><br>You should also stop the rotation of the barrel when you enter the tank, as sometimes the gun rotates when I get in after being shot out.<br><br>...Still testing<br><br>Andy<br><br>EDIT: it was ofcourse 5-10 squares not 3-5... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I remember how I used to put a second joystick on the floor under the table (yes, ok...) to be able to use the fire button (which happened to be recognized as the space bar) for launching extra weapons in Turrican using my foot. (I guess I couldn't just press the space bar, but I don't remember why not.) Your game would certainly require such advanced tactics! ;)<br><br>I just played your game some more, I actually survived for a few minutes and destroyed one or two enemies! It was funny, I was moving *very* slowly and carefully towards the exit of my own camp, when suddenly an enemy tank jumped in and boom!

Maybe the laser weapon should have some disadvantage, like a long reload time. Or maybe I should follow your advice and not come to a halt in front of one. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The control method you've utilised annoyed me somewhat, and I think given the arcade nature of the game, I'd prefer a simplified control method. I'd prefer the pitch to not require RMB; I'd like the turret to be able to go higher too. And certainly I'd like the yaw to turn with the tank body when you turn the tank.<br><br>To please everybody, it would be no great task to provide the option for each control method. If you're keen on having people choose the fine control that you've gone for, I had an idea for my game: I wanted a more RPG style control method but I realise some people are going to want shortcuts, so I will give them that option, at the expense of certain things: ie, if they choose the easy control method, certain vehicles or weapons are no longer available so to get those items, players need to master the advanced controls.<br><br>Also, I would quite like the option of a 3rd person view, both in and out of the tank.<br><br>Having said all of this, I really like it so far. The look is really nice and it's really satisfying blowing up enemy tanks. Looking forward to the next release... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
