This seems to be a fairly good way to go about it (imho).<br><br>With a mmgoowofjeflubber you'll need to get at least the server and network stuff working very solidly and usable with simple function calls. Once you've got this bit you can build on a modular framework so people can add their own stuff. You'll need a totally flexible type for the character (be it player or Non-player or monster) this way everything works in the same way so building a system will be more fluid and accessable as a community project. It also means people can build on the characters and enhance them without buggering up exisiting code.<br><br>Anyway... Good luck, and get coding your network code and server, get that rock solid and come speak to us again. With something we can get a handle on.<br><br>If you get this completed it demonstrates that you are committed so other people will be more willing to help.

Most possibilities must be addressed within the plan so that at least the vast majority of situations that may arise can be dealt with quickly in a way which makes sense and is acknowledged by the team.<br>The plan needs to encompass the game mechanics, storyline, media content and a vision of playability of the finished product as well as the coding structure.<br><br>It is essential that contributors are aware of their own strengths and weaknesses in a real sense. There's no point someone saying 'Il do the level design' just to get onboard if they really are not suited to such a task.<br><br>The problems usually arise with this sort thing because contributors do not have defined boundaries, and of course, they wish to express their artistic license and individual flare.

If a comunity project is as flexible as that, I think it can grab more help. How to make useful the help of a casual wanderer...I don't know...If its a pair of really clever lines, a routine, or a good small bit of art, maybe even worth it.<br><br>A "chalk board" in 3d, where you can edit in a 3d space where others are editing, sounds interesting thing to see.<br><br>Something of these was mentioned by some Blender in certain Blender forums, a while ago.

A kind of thing like some existing 3d comunities (rwx, vrml, etc)  but allowing editing. You can navigate...have some very basic interaction (ie: some very basic text chat to coordinate a bit with ppl)  and...ability to EDIT the meshes. <br><br>Actually..would way much more simpler to do it so. Not add modelling features, other than move/rotate full objects(meshes, entities, how u call it) , as u would be importing an improved mesh. Things necesary would be force a rescale, if it detects the scale is not 1:1 (some users dont know how to do it) , it will force it to an scale. (to avoid...surprises..)<br><br>While this is interesting...I'd now then that all what i edit/create there, would be rippeable/stolen by anyone, so, I'd : a) do just quick, fun hacks of meshes, yet useful.... b) I'd be paid for my work:as u're getting some payment, u don't mind that much the stealing...Surely u wont do ur master piece of art , your main piece in ur portfolio and put it there.... I doubt payment would be that high.<br><br>Sorry if I always speak bout $.  But seems many coders do their work here to earn some bucks, so I see no harm.<br><br>Also, a lot of people just would like to play and contribute freely, don't think this opinion would represent any significative number...more than anything, quite a minority.<br><br>I meant, i myself if find something like that, wouldn't do anything good -for what I consider good- freely. But just play a bit. But that's me.<br><br>As I said, the editor idea sounds interesting. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
