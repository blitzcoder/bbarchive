All of the robots will then either battle to the death like in Robot Wars, or play a variant of tag.<br><br>The tournament would be spanned over a number of rounds, each round adding new elements to the game, meaning that each participant has to tweak their AI accordingly before each round. My aim is to present the tournament like a "TV series", the 'episodes' being the rounds which make up the tournament. Before each round, a profile of the participants are given, then you watch the action unfold, and then the current league table is presented at the end. These episodes would be distributed as they are made.<br><br>To make this project work, we need to begin by building up an engine. It's main components, and the order in which we need to construct them, is shown in the flowchart below:<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v203/RyanMoody/BAIT.jpg"><br><br>As you can see, we need to start off with the data declarations. There are also two miscellaneous tasks that can be done at any time - the front end and the league table.<br><br>So, if you want to get involved, tell us which part of the project you want to work on - the more, the merrier. Any suggestions are also appreciated.<br><br>The tasks that can be done at the moment are:<br><br>1) Data Declarations (Highest priority)<br>2) Front End<br>3) League Tables<br><br>To see what has been discussed already, visit <a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=45439" target="_blank">http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=45439</a><br><br>Any volunteers?<br><br>Ryan Moody <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In response to your posts:<br><br>1) Data declarations - This basically means declaring all the types, variables, constants etc. so that everyone knows what they can work with. If we didn't do this first, integrating everyone's work into one big program could be problematic, and it may also run less efficiently.<br><br>2) Front End - This would include an eye-catching title screen, maybe the functionality to display the contestants profiles, and a limited menu system. Remember, I'ld prefer the finished product to keep the interactive side to an absolute minimum - I'ld like it to be presented as a "TV series", the rounds being the "episodes" of the series. So, for each round, we distribute an executable episode of the action, and then you can run it, sit back, and watch the action unfold by itself.<br><br>3) League table - This would be presented at the end of each episode. This won't have to involve any fancy calculations - just given an array of players and their scores, the league table should be able to present them in score order in an eye-catching way.<br><br>A question I'ld like to ask is: HUDs, UIs, APIs - what do those mean?!<br><br>I second Coorrae's vote that WolRon should be the project leader! Soon, I'll need someone to take over my position as the 'foreman', and I think WolRon would do a fine job.<br><br>Drago, I'ld be very grateful if you host our files for us, that would be very helpful!<br><br>My biggest concern is using the Millisecs() function to restrict how long each player's AI can work for. This is bound to create inconsistencies between different computers as to how the action unfolds. I've an old, slow PC, so if we restricted the time limit, then some of the participant's bots may not move at all on my machine. I suggest that when a player submits some AI, we perform a test on it to check it runs at a reasonable speed in all possible "arena states". If it meets the test, we then include it into the program. If not, we notify the player that it's "overweight", so that they can make amendments. Then, as we know all participants have fast AI, we impose no timeout restrictions - each player's AI is run for as long as it takes. This is not only fair, but it also ensures that everyone will see the same result. (And we don't have to worry about a time-out procedure, making the project less complex).<br><br>Keep up the good work guys!<br><br>Ryan <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In our current planning, there is -NO WAY- we can guarantee that our code will produce the exact same results on all computers because of floating point math discrepancies.<br><br><i>Some</i> of the reasons for this are our chosen use of the following methods:<br>- Move[speed] (speed -1 to 1)<br>- Rotate[speed] (speed -1 to 1)<br>- GetAngle[x, y] returns the angle -180 to 180 from your bot to an x, y position<br>- RotateWeapon[weapon, speed] (speed -1 to 1)<br>- GetDistance[x, y] returns the distance from your bot to x, y position<br>- Scan[relative angle] (returns wall, mine, refuel, powerup, rival [number] position [x, y])<br>- 100% maximum speed = 10 units per clock cycle (because 99% would equal 9.9 units)<br>- collisions are based on a RADIUS from center of model, in order to keep the same behavior between different models<br>- Max speed is decreased by .1% for every line of script (not including comments) over 100 (1100 lines of AI code would then equal 0% speed)<br><br><br>All of the above methods will require floating point math either by design (-1.0 to 1.0) or because they will return an arbitrary angle (which will not be an integer).<br><br>For these reasons, we either have to completely redesign how this game will work or tournaments will have to be executed on ONE OFFICIAL computer only and then the results will be posted.<br><br>Some ways that we could possibly redesign the game are:<br>--attaching all game objects to some kind of grid<br>..all methods are changed to use integers only (-100 to 100 instead of -1.0 to 1.0)<br>..any rotation speed commands will have to be changed to exact degree commands<br>..this will still leave a problem with angles returned from (for instance) a scanning function  Do we drop angles and just return co-ordinates? or what?<br><br>--MAYBE write some kind of custom FPU (floating point unit) that actually uses integers internally<br>..ALL math performed by the engine will use the custom FPU<br>..This will most likely be EXTREMELY slow in comparison to the real FPU<br><br><br><br>Where do we go from here?<br>Let me hear your ideas. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This edition may only be used in BAIT", plus a note somewhere in the docs stating that you are using BVM, with a link to the site. No more. If a splash screen *before* the game itself loads worries you, it could be done as an additional funciton that you need to explictely call to unlock BVM, and that displays the splash screen. So that you can have it displayed when *you* chose, between the start of the game and the first access to BVM (for a better integration).<br>If that sounds OK for you, please contact me.<br><br>Note: it is very doable to use BVM in a non blocking way (read: with timeouts) if you need it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
