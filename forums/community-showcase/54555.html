I used to play Yahtzee 'professionally' (for cans of beer - 1 for every 100 points difference) every night when I was at university. My best night I managed 1971 points over a six round score sheet.... so I know what i am talking about for tactics.<br><br>Possible bugs... <br>============<br>I got Yahtzee early in the game and thought I had chosen it then clicked submit... only the first quarter of the button changed to a darker colour.<br><br>At the end of the game I seemed to have an extra go after every category had been darkened. It then allowed me to choose Yahtzee again. Only then did the game finish.<br><br>User Interface comments...<br>====================<br>Too much red. Red dice on a red background and depper red for chosen categories doesn't work for me. You need a better contrast to show what has been chosen and what is left<br><br>For master tacticians we really need to see the points awarded to each category... not just the total score<br><br>... A good strategy is to 'sacrifice' the ones category while trying to get lots of sixes... these can be put in sixes, 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind, yahtzee and chance - and all serve to bump up the score considerably. But I need to know if I have made up for some sacrificed ones or twos through getting extra threes, fours, fives or sixes in order to still make my bonus. {I am sure you have included the bonus - right ?}<br><br>The scrolling text when you get a yahtzee was a bit cheesey - could do with something a bit more exciting !<br><br>I would prefer to click on dice to toggle whether they are 'held' or not rather than on a hold button.<br><br><br>SM. ST. and LG. ST. - is there any way to fit the full text on ? (Possibly call them Low and High)<br><br>Not too keen on the blocky retro text for score and 'Highscore' etc. - doesn't fit with the classy font used for Yahtzee title<br><br>As mentioned... Yahtzee is played over six rounds. You should have a scorecard to show the history of each round.<br><br>What does the digit in the top left corner do ?<br>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br><br>Any way... Congratulations on completing your first game. Have a serious think about colour schemes before tackling the next one... UI design is almost as important as coding. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You can score a total of 4 Yahtzees.<br><br>I agree, the color scheme has too much red, I'm horrible with art...  I'm going to redo the layout when I get time.<br><br>That's a good idea, i'll add a option to view a score card.<br><br>The '0' in the upper left-hand corner wasn't suppose to be in this build (oops!).  It was from when I was testing the game.<br><br>Thanks for the criticism, I have much to learn! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

From memory, you get 100 extra points for every 'extra' Yahtzee that you can legitimately fit into another category, so you could theoretically get a Yahtzee in every category except Low and High straight (a Full House being 3 of a number and 2 of the same number again.)<br><br>If you are intending to develop the game, it might be cool to have a multiplayer version (over a network ??), as player v. player tactics do come into play when you are chasing an opponents score... Do you take the 'safe' low straight when you still have a roll to go, or risk a no holds re-roll to try for another Yahtzee... <br><br>An alternative challenge would be to try writing some AI code for a computer opponent.<br><br>I'm sure the community will be happy to chip in with help and advice on either of these options ;-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
