Why?  Because I scaled everything up to fit a 640x480 screen.  The Amiga version used 320x200.  So, that alone made the graphics 4 times bigger.  Plus, if you look at the "background.png" file, it's 128k.  I threw that in as a quicky.  The original version used a copper-list to change the background colors on the fly...it didn't load any graphics for the background.  Blitz can do that but not as easily and besides....it's 128k...no big deal for a quicky demo.  Also, most of the size comes from the media (scaled up) and the BB exe which everyone knows is a little bloated.  Also, the Amiga could use 4-bit graphics which is smaller than the 16/32 bit PNG files I use.<br><br>Unused media?  Maybe a little but so what.  I paid $2.99/hour for internet access 11 years ago.  Now, it's cheap and truely unlimited for me.  Maybe you're on a slow dialup...dunno.

NOT 14.  In fact, SOTB had major problems running on anything faster than 7.14MHz....and it ran with 512k of Ram.  I wasn't going for groundbreaking...I was going for retro.  And I am fully aware of the awesome abilities the Amiga had (I actually own four Amigas).<br><br>Also keep in mind that the Amiga had dedicated hardware for scrolling and sprites.  And while SOTB WAS groundbreaking, they also had fulltime programmers (three I think) that probably worked months to get that out of a 7.14Mhz machine.  I did it in about 2 hours....and that 2 hours included a lot of tweaking and downloading and goofing off.<br><br><div class="quote"> <br>I don't get it, if you love an old game, then why don't you make a NEW version?
