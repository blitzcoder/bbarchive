Problem: each OS is a bit different<br><br>See "[x]"-close button on windows: some have them top-left, some top-right, some even have nothing of it but a "global" button bar for the active/focused window.<br>This also depends on user settings, themes, ...<br><br>BUT... there is some kind of "general compromise" - and this is to have the "window title bar" on top of a window (if there is one) and to have buttons in that bar-area.<br>Even if you use a different OS/theming, most users for sure know what you mean with "[x]" because they see it in their IOS/android-casual-game-popups (which DEVs surely know ;-)) or tools they use next to yours (Blender, Gimp, Max, Maya, Photoshop, zBrush, ... for the assets)<br><br><br>More important is: _I_ as a one who is ought to use your editor am a bit disattracted if the GUI does look like "puzzled together". If everything looks "sleek" and "organized" I also assume that the product (the editor) is similar.<br><br>Your editor is then similar to "Mainsworthys" games: it might work nicely, it might be doing exactly what it is supposed to do BUT ... people will have a bad taste as it looks a bit "amateurish" then (and with "amateurish" people have certain assumptions - like "bugs" or "limited functionality").<br><br><br>-&gt; invest a few hours to polish the GUI elements, make them sleek / nice looking<br>-&gt; invest more hours to make things look consistent (button alignment, button position, ...)<br><br>I bet ... you will feel better afterwards (but not yet convinced of the result as it just looks "different" to before) - and you will surely be motivated to show off the changes in this thread.<br><br>If you do not know how to do a proper GUI (see my game ... I am struggling too, but Adam did not offer me some help yet ;-)) ask people for help - or look how other "toolsets" design/style their widgets.<br><br>For a TOOL it is always good to have them "snappy / clear type". There is no need for fancy gradients, splashy colors ... <br>Make it look a bit like a business app (grayscale or "dark" or "bright") and use light toned colors as accents to emphasize important things ("delete", "run", "variable is linked to another actor" ...).<br><br>also do not make the buttons "huge" - people need the space for their project and project organization (open windows with trees, navigation). If not sure: allow scaling of gui widgets (text, not graphically done button-graphics).<br><br><br>Afterwards: show the changes to the people (here - and otherwhere)<br><br>After Afterwards: create the next revision of your changes (as surely the people spotted some bugs and annoying things)<br><br>Do this until it is 80% perfect - the missing 20% will occupy too much of your time (pareto optimum). You might once finish such bugs/annoyances but for now this will have to be okay.<br><br><br><br>Edit: <br>- your Tool is "windows only" - so I will only judge by screenshots/screencasts (am on Linux)<br>- checkboxes in your screenshot are bit "big" and therefor "checkpoint lists" use more space than really needed<br>-&gt; there were "radio button / checkbox sets" in many RAD tools for "option boxes" to save on space<br>- use "button layouts"<br><br><pre class=code>
