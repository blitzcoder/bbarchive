A lot more than 200. I'll grant you they don't look great, but I'm all about performance, since I do hope to make money from this project, and you don't really pay them much attention when you're playing. I won't be changing it before the demo anyway, because I haven't been able to test on any really low spec machines yet. If it plays really well on low spec machines, I would consider it, but I don't want any more configuration options. I already have five different shadow modes, three different resolutions and color depth choices. If I make too many of those options, I'm going to lose potential customers who can't figure out what to disable to get more speed.<br><br>JFK : I'll take another look at the crowd texture, but I'm fairly sure it's not antialiased any more. It was in an old version, but I'm almost certain I fixed that. I was hoping to avoid using an alpha channel for speed reasons. Again, if performance on low spec machines is better than I expect when I release the demo, I might reconsider.<br><br>Bot Builder : Point taken on the textures. I just received a pack of textures in the mail this morning, so I'll see if I can find something suitable. VRam is curretly hovering around 10mb minimum, and I don't expect to get it under 8mb, so I have plenty of vram to spare before I'll get to 16mb. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Here's the problem. The screenshot above is taken from my options screen where the camera revolves constantly. It's better for screenshots because it adds a bit of variety to the angle and it's the only game mode I have where two CPU players play each other.<br><br>If I use a static camera  for the rest of the game modes, that limits the portion of the crowd that is visible. But a static camera has to be zoomed out slightly in order to show all the playable court. I'm not switching the camera when the players change ends ( you play from the top and the bottom of the screen ) so that saves that. But even so, that's a bare minimum of 18 rows of people visible from the static camera. That's 16,416 polys for the crowd. That number of poly's alone would probably slow some of the onboard Intel chips down too much for the game to be playable, and I'm very serious about making the game playable on low spec machines.<br><br>If I thought I could get this published commercially, then  I could afford commercial minimum requirements, but I don't see that happening. If there are any representatives of commercial publishers prowling the board, feel free to prove me wrong :P  I can see this being published as on a shareware site though, and I really need to maximize my customer base if I'm only earning on a per-sale basis ( no advance. )<br><br>If the demo proves unplayable on low spec machines, and the extra poly's don't do too much damage on the cards that can play it anyway, I might consider it.<br><br>I'll drop you an email about the model, and take a look at it in game. It'll probably be a temptation to use it once I see it in action, but I really can't see being able to afford another 16,000 poly's.<br><br>Thanks Ruz, I'm glad someone likes it the way it is, because it's probably not gonna be viable to do differently. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I've added Rob's crowd model ( thanks for that ) and put on a basic texture. I can maybe improve the texture a little, but texturing is not my forte, so it's probably not gonna get a whole lot better. I've also added some sprite shadows under the static geometry.

So there will be an option in the settings window when you start the game to pick 2d or 3d crowds. Performance may still be affected, despite trimming it down to 6,500 polys so people with low spec PC's may have to choose the faster option. Everyone else can pick the one they like looking at best.<br><br>I am working on this as much as possible, so I do hope to have the beta complete soon.
