I do have a reason why I didn't do that, but I don't think it's a very valid one anymore.<br><br>Rob, yes Bugaboo is an obvious comparison and of course an inspiration for the game. However, if you play it now, you will hopefully notice this a big departure from that game in almost every way (except there are still fleas naturally). P.S. When is your lander game due? I'm itching to try that out.<br><br>Clique, thanks :)<br><br>Rob (again). I have had a version with scrolling but I dropped it. The problem with scrolling is that if the orb/any of the other fleas are off screen, you have incomplete information about the playfield. I went for simplicity.<br><br>jon. Thanks. We (the fleafall team) have had many discussions about visual meters. In the end, we all agreed it was better without it, although there is an initial learning curve bump to get over. We have got audio feedback in now though.<br><br>GfK, cheers. Stage 3 is the hardest, no doubt about it. We put that one in the demo version after much deliberation. In future demo versions we may replace it with a more simple level. Out of interest, which levels do people like most?<br><br>Rob, the uninstall will be fixed in the next build.<br><br>Perturbatio, it is tricky Stage 3. You can always practice in multiplayer mode with no opponents if you wanted. You can also try out 2 other game modes in the Multiplayer section (Thief and BasketBall)<br><br>Midnight, yes! It was a fun game though. Strange that your gfx didn't extract properly. Are all the graphics in the game a mess? Never had this problem before.<br><br>eBusiness, around £12.95 (but there is a discount if you can find it in the demo)<br><br>Midnight, can you e-mail me a screenshot by any chance? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

We've tried to make the levels quite varied and so inevitably there will be bits you won't like as much as others. Also, I take your point on the 'any key' idea, however to make multiplayer work well, we need seperate keys for seperate players. For consistency, we left it as it was.<br><br>I'd be interested to see if you still think it's hard. People tend to excel at this game pretty fast.<br><br>Thank you very much both of you.

Top-notch playability. Nice and addictive.<br><br>I'm with James on the 'low passage' bits. How detecting when the flea is under a low passage then making the jump height low (provided the player just taps the direction key)?<br>Having said that don't tweak the controls too much. They generally work superbly well.<br><br>Another thing you might want to consider is adjusting the non-interactive background in some of the levels. Maybe fade it out a little to distinguish it from the platform parts. It can be a little tricky at first to spot which parts of the level the flea can land on. The &gt;space junk&lt; level in particular.<br><br>Back to the praises ...<br><br>I should be outside enjoying the weather but I can't leave my fleas alone ;-p <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Unless we continuously predict the jump path and adjust height accordingly, the flea might do something unexpected, and therefore annoying. <br><br>Any automatic variation of jump height makes the jump trajectory unknown. At least at the moment, you know you will bump your head.<br><br>Also, the fixed height is very important for level design, which is one significant distinction between its mechanics and Bugaboo's.<br><br>So those are my reasons for leaving it as it is. However, if you do end up getting FleaFall Champion, you can make your own levels and edit the ones you have so that there are less little passages if you like.<br><br>Yes, changing the background a little more is something I'll look into after FleaFall Champion is out. In levels that you don't have in Apprentice, we've done other effects such as blurring for background plates. Generally, I prefer the black edge foreground and coloured edge background approach that is in the Chase level (the one with the cat and birds et.c), but each to thier own.<br><br>Thanks again, and I'm sure the weather can spare you for a day or two, besides the fleas can get lonely when they aren't exercised regularly...(is that a clue about a possible future feature?) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
