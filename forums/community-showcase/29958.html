That gem in the logo definitely needs to be semi transparent and less noisy.  It looks like a big green rock.  And add some specular highlights to it.  Of course just specular highlights would be something at least.<br><br>Oh and the word Pirate is not beight enough.  Make it as yellow as the word gems.  Look at the little logo on your sig and it doesn't look as good there.<br><br>And make the hand pointer much brighter.  <br><br>Maybe cut down ont he blue fog on the island some.  <br><br>Looks pretty nice as is though.  I mean it's not ugly or anyhting.<br><br>Oh and I might make the bottom of the chest... the background behind the gems much darker, so the gems are brighter than it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Ill try and answer some of em now.<br><br>@mearrin69 <br>If you look on the Island you will see the wee treasue chest, where you actually play the game, the Island itself is only the MENU background. somthing nice to look at while you select your options.<br><br>I have filled it with fun things to look at and watch, like little skulls that more, nuts fall from the tree's and roll into the sea. Star fish and crabs come out of the water hang about and go back in...<br><br>When you click play, the cam will zoom from the island view into the chest view and you then play the game..<br><br><br>@SSwift<br><br>YUP, Ill be making the gems alpha about .5 I might also be giving them a glow effect, not sure yet. and I do agree about the title.<br><br>@Michael Reitzenstein <br><br>Whats your point. look at half life or Quake you could say Oh no not another doom. They all copy the same game model and game rules as the FPS games that have past into time. I havent seen a 3D Bejeweled game yet. so why not.<br><br>Oh yeah, this was never meant to be a big project, if you must know why I decided to make this and not something new, then Ill tell you. Its actually for my Wife, she plays those crap crad games and thats about it. I know she likes this type of game so its being made for her. as for making any money from it. thats only a bonus if some one likes it enough to buy it. so I dont see it as any sort of competition to the original.<br><br><br><br>@Epicboy<br><br>Like I said making money from it will onyl be a bonus, Im glad you like the look of it..<br><br>I also agree with you in that its crap when some one makes a game, based on some other game and they get banged for it. Look at Defender ?? on PS 2 now is it not ? in some form of 3D as well.<br><br>There is also a 3D Dizzy game on the way. 3D Worms. the list is a mile long. Its gotten to the stage that even the pro's are going over old ground, for the simple reason that the age of the average gamer today has never seen some of these games so old is new if you know what i mean.<br><br>I also agree it dont matter what the game is, as long as it looks good, plays well. and is fun.<br><br><br>Again thanks for all of your comments. Ill take a lot of it in, and the next screen shots you see could also inlcude a playing demo.. fingers crossed. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
