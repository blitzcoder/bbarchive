It is weird, it looks like a car or a ball slowing down. Same thing when the character lands on the ground.<br>-&gt;the collisions are not done the best way, the character can start to fall in the empty space and if it is near enough a platform, he is able to climb the wall in some way and to go back on he platform.<br><br>Suggestions :<br>To improve the collisions detection and the behavior of the character, you can use a 2 step collisions detection :<br>-&gt;one linepick from the top of the character to below to detect where is the ground, with this, if a pickable mesh has been hit, you know where is the ground, if not either there is no ground or the character is too high above the ground.<br>-&gt;one or several colliders sphere to detect where are the walls and obstacles, with this if a collision happened you know where to reposition the character or you can use a collider with a response slide and let blitz3d reposition the character.<br><br>good :<br>-&gt;you seem to like to make menu, even if it is not important when the game is not finished, but at least you have a menu<br>-&gt;you have managed to create a full scene with static meshes, skinned animated meshes, textures, some effects, and the graphics are ok, this means you have some skills in this area, and i am sure you will keep improving them.<br><br>In my opinion, you should decrease the amount of time you spend  working on special effects and graphics and increase the amount of time you spend working on controls and gameplay. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
