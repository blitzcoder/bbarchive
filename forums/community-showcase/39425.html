I don't know about civilians but I do know as far as America's and the other military forces that have joined us in Iraq that the Mothers and fathers are getting tired of finding out their sons and daughters are dead and not knowing what they died for.<br>I'm not sure about that civilian count either...I don't think that many people were 'civilians'.  There are 5 year olds running around in the middle east with grenades strapped to their chest.  Once someone takes up arms even a rock, they are a combatant.<br>I'm going on another deployment to Iraq before Christmas.  I've already told my wife that if I die in Iraq, that the only thing I will have died for is to protect my fellow comrades in arms.  But, it will probably be something pointless like driving over a land mine on the way to pick up mail or something.<br>Basically, dying for nothing at all except for the guy or gal to the left or right of 'em.<br>Are Americans dying to 'liberate' the people of Iraq?  Pffft.  Yeah, right.  We only serve the 'noblest' cause.  Ha ha ha.  World Peace.   Ha ha ha hah ha.  This is a ---- stupid joke.<br>And if anyone feels the need to flame my opinions you should know that I've served over 4 years in the Marine Corps and 1 in the Army now.  Both honorable and both Active Duty.  I've been on more deployments than I can count for a total of at least 2 1/2 years now, and I've only been in 5.  So, I'm basically saying unless you know what you're talking about...<br><br>Everytime I see another death, it saddens me because these people didn't need to die.
