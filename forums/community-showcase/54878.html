It was my first BlitzPlus project started Nov last year and abandoned after 6 months as I realised it would take too long to finish.  It has real potential, enemies, weapons, keys, puzzles, different level graphics, moving platforms etc.  Actually it has a 17 page To Do list!!  I just knew to finish it was going to take months of code plus need an artist or two etc and I wasn't convinced that the target market was big enough.  Hopefully I'll work on it again as it is something that I am really keen to do as I LOVE this sort of game.<br><br>Try my other games at <a href="http://www.greyaliengames.com" target="_blank">http://www.greyaliengames.com</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Sales are going well thanks, can't disclose numerical info due to being in a contract I'm afraid.  But I was happy to sell even one. lets just say that I set several milestones and they've been broken and the sales haven't stopped even though it's after christmas.  I'm not going to be rich however as this isn't a top 10 game, and they are the one's that really make the money, plus it will fade pretty quickly now Christmas is past and it's out of the "new" lists on the portals (I think).  Some games sell all year round of course.  If the publisher ever lets me (and they might never) I'll post the downloads/sales/conversion rate figures for the good of the community. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
