Currently, you can only post source code here. With my program, you can compile it and then post it here. Or even just include external media (models, sounds, etc.) with it!<br><br>My question is, is this legal, because Blitz would technically be hosting whatever files anyone posts.

'normal' postings are a few hundred or maybe a couple of thousand characters in size. If you start posting binary files, those messages could be hundreds or even thousands of times the size of a typical posting, putting a much higher load on the database server, very long load times, massively increased bandwidth (every user looking at the thread essentially downloads the file each time they look)<br>Gives all those downsides, I'm sure that posting converted binary files on the forum will get one banned in no time.<br><br>Anyway, if you do have a real reason to convert binary info to text format (which does not involve posting it on the forum), then there is no reason to reinvent the wheel -- there are already several established standards that do exactly that:<br>- UUencode/UUdecode<br>- MIME<br>- Base64: <a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=49450" target="_blank">http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=49450</a><br><br>Note that email doesn't support binary files either, and all email clients use one of the above variants to convert the binary file to text and include it in the body of the message. The email client itself hides this from the user and shows the 'attached' documents, but from the internet's point of view those attachments are plain text just like everything else. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
