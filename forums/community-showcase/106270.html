In my video you can see a bug, where the PlayedGames variable is not reseted, so the rooms would keep reseting after each Game.<br><br>The biggest difficulty was with the Game called "Lazer Jones". As every sprite should get different Color while moving down.<br>As Blitz3d cant change the color of the sprites (like blitzmax), and i didnt wanted to use 1000 sprite images for every line and animation, i had to invent something to recreate this collorfull effect. Who would say that the Sprites are composed of 2 different images with 2 frames of animation, with 2 collors (same as the original game).<br>This was the real challenge at that time, as i had to change the way how to display the sprites on the screen (which is, usualy, displaying the images directly where they are,changing only the animation of them).<br><br>Btw, the whole game is in 320x240. It can be Resized to the fullscreen using the Resizeable blitzbasic window. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Good to know what tools you used.<br><br>One thing that seems a bit wrong is the height that Jones jumps in the hotel, it seems in the original he jumps higher.<br><br>I'm not sure I follow the "Lazer Jones" sprite colors problem, there's about 6 colors for invaders and they're pre-colored images? I see the lazer bolt is white as opposed to flashing colors in the original (grey/red/yellow/blue/green/cyan?).<br><br>Some criticism, I notice you've no music which I prefer, and there's no Jones in the room foreground which makes you wonder where he's gone. I would change the serif/typewriter font to sans serif as it's a bit too familiar, also the score/time numbers are noticeably unaligned which looks careless. Other than that it looks fine. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Or else Jones wouldnt be able to jump over the npc's, to avoid them.<br><br>For the "Lazer Jones" game, i needed to decide to either make and color every sprite separately, which would result in arround 46 different sprite images, which would then, somehow, needed to be calculated and positioned on the screen.<br>Or what i had in Mind, is to use some colorfull background, and to draw the sprites over it, using transparent images (simulating the raster effects from the c64 demos). <br>And it was done in that way, with some extra copy and paste work.<br>Maybe it cant be seen in the video, but the sprites are not sigle colored, but have a gardient collor in them.<br><br>For the font, everything was fine, using the standard blitz.font. Everything until iv playtested it on a system, which didnt had blitzbasic installed. The font in that case was like 2x2 pixel, which resulted in, well, unreadable text.<br>So after testing few fonts, Courier New looked as it could fit the height, and still look ok. <br>But maybe i should go back to the Blitz font, and include it into the Archive (if i decide to release the Game). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It looks fine although I think the invaders stay purple at the bottom whereas in the original they go red last.<br><br>I would definitely change the courier new font to blitz, also the Game Over text would look better if it flashes. <br><br>Another thing that would look good is to slide the room contents to the left after game over like in the original, just to give the player a bit of a breather. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
