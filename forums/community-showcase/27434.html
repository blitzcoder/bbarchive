Can I define custom meshes for the pivot "model type" or something? Can I export that info out - separate of the level/texture info? <br></div>The custom properties can be used for whatever you want. You can write scripts, flags, keywords, etc. They can be exported in a seperate text file, or be included in the name of the entity, when exporting to b3d. Custom properties can be used on all model types. Lights can be exported as pivots, with extra info in their name, or as a seperate text file.<br><br><div class="quote"> Is there "statistic window" or something about how many and how big lightmaps were created, and preview of those lightmaps?  <br></div>Not yet, but there will be something like that. But you can use the 'Lighting Methods Window' sort of :) It's available from the 'Window' menu, or in the 'lighting methods' group in the material settings.<br><br><div class="quote"> Is the "auto expand" meant for calculating lightmap info over the edge of the polygon (but so that it does not mess adjacent pixels) or what it is? <br></div>When using low resolution lightmaps, ie. 256x256 with a lot of polygons, it is impossible to avoid, a little bit of edge tearing. The auto expand feature is there to remove this. Normally it's not really nescesarry, but it's nice to have it :)<br><br>You can also go into the 'Lighting Methods Window' and expand or blur a lightmap manually. Here you can also see what lightmaps, are used and how big they are, and resize them, create new, or delete them.<br><br><div class="quote"> Can gile[s] handle boned .B3D? <br></div>gile[s] can import boned meshes, but not animation, so I'm not sure it's useful for this. You will loose vertex weights and animation upon export. This may be resolved in future versions, but is not on the top of the list.<br><br><div class="quote"> One more question: can you, on the textures panel, specify a texture to be a gobbo? That is, it projects a shadow based on it's color? <br></div>If I get your question then yes. Create a new material (or use one already there), apply an alpha or masked texture to it. Set the material lighting method to 'None', and enable only cast shadows in the properties below. Apply the material to the model.<br><br>The 'None' and 'Vertex' lighting methods, do not take up any lightmap space. One thing to note, is that materials with no lighting methods, are assumed to be fullbright, when rendering global illumination so it's a good idea to make them not affect the GI rendering, or make them dark. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You can do this individually for each material, though deleting a lightmap will affect all the materials that use that lightmap. You may also create a new lightmap, and apply it to the material. The apply button is the one on the left just below the list.<br><br>BTW: Does the grid, and stuff work for you?

Unchecking this the brush will only consider the distance, and ignore angle differences completely.<br><br>- Affect All Models<br>Checking this will allow you to paint continuosly over any number of models at once. Unchecking it, will allow you to ie. paint the legs of a chair, and not paint the floor (if they are two seperate models).<br><br>Gile[s] does not consider surfaces of the same model (in the Blitz sense) to be different entities, but if this is needed I can easily implement it.<br><br>So if I understand your question you need to disable 'Angular Falloff' and enable 'Affect all models', but I'm still not sure I did :)<br><br>Or if the question was whether there might be a flaw in the paint system, that would cause other locations than the one you are painting to, to receive paint.

I can understand that, but...<br><br>Can I at least set the texel/meter(unit) resolution for rendering or am I stuck just choosing the (combined) lightmap size? Setting the resolution is a must feature even if it might waste some space from the lighmap if it has to use bigger one to be able to put all polys on it (using the texel/meter(unit) resolution set)... here's an example:<br><br>Room (level), with separate floor, ceiling, walls and staircase (for culling), ie 7 objects. Fine. <br><br>Now I make lightmaps for this room, for every object, and as you can see they really are one combined object although they are not... so just using 512*512 lightmap equally for every object would create vastly different texel/meter(unit) resolutions per object because they probably have different number of polygons and polygon sizes... end result would be that adjacent walls might look really horrible because the other one has twice as much resolution on its lightmap for example. <br><br>Being able to set the resolution cures this, but might waste lightmap space... if gile[s] could generate maps as needed, this might reduce the wastage, but would generate more lightmaps (more than one per object).<br><br>Anyways, I think it would be important to have all these options available. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I've been testing gile[s] on some pretty big 20k poly levels and none of the lightmap options are capable of filling it.

But here is how gile[s] work:<br><br>Lightmaps are linked to materials (or brushes) NOT to model geometry.<br><br>A lightmap, can be shared between as many or as few materials as you wish. Each material can use the same lightmap, or use a different one. Each lightmap is optimized by usage...This means that ALL polygons using the same lightmap will use the same texel resolution, therefore in Mustang's room example wall, floor, etc. could be set to use the same lightmap, and thus use the same texel size.<br><br>The good thing about this approach is that you can easily choose where you want the most detailed lightmaps. I.e. a ceiling might not need a particularily highres lightmap, while the walls and floors would need more detail. So you simply apply a lowres lightmap to the ceiling material, and a highres lightmap to the floor and wall materials. This also means you end up with the exact same number of surfaces, as you had before lightmapping.<br><br>In Rob's example, there is no need to cut up the models. Simply apply different lightmaps to the different materials. If you click on the lightmap button in the lighting properties of the material, you will be taken to the lighting methods window. Here you may select, or create, a lightmap, adjust it's size, and then apply it to the material by clicking the button on the left just below the selection list.<br><br>When importing any non-gls files into gile[s], it applies a default lightmap to all materials (except ones with alpha blending/textures or masked textures, in which case it chooses vertex lighting, due to some Blitz3D 'problems'). <br><br>The lightmaps you have in the 'Lighting Methods Window' shows the exact number and resolution of lightmaps gile[s] generates and exports. No more, no less. gile[s] will NEVER generate more lightmaps than you tell it to! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
