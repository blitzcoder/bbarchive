Its a typical 2D platformer expect with a character that can wack boxes and golfballs with a golf-club? What role does the golf-part play?<br><br>Only spelling mistake I saw was ARme Win the Game. Should be "wins the game".<br><br>It looks nice, music and snd fx is good. Loading is perhaps a bit long. I think the character should have a swim-animation.<br><br>Perhaps you could use the golf-club to hook onto pegs and swing about? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bionic_Commando_%28arcade%29" target="_blank"> Bionic Commando</a> style (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpHG3imEB3Q" target="_blank">video</a> of C64 version) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So drawing the player horizontally rather than vertically would lead to unexpected visual problems. <br><br>I may add a few more characters later if this game is working for me. But for now, I think it's OK.<br>Nice idea the Bionic Commando (I loved that game back in time). I Will I investigate the possibilities.<br><br>Do not worry about the platformer look for now, this is a Tutorial level with box messages (unread for the purpose of this video) and obstacles to learn most of the Metagolf Features.<br><br>I try this game with 4 friends and we have lots of fun because of the "action oriented" idea behind. You can literally make interesting figures like dribbling, accurate shots, in air passes to a team member, etc.<br><br>There will be puzzles, wider levels for more intense game, limited "hole in" level, race against time, and some other game mode.<br><br>This is why I call it Meta-golf, because it's not exactly a typical golf game where everybody play with his own ball and wait it's turn to play. It's a realtime competition with trial and error for everyone! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That is probably the best term applied so far.<br><br>Metagolf reminds me of (reminds me of, not a copy of) a really old game for the Palm (Palm OS 3.0-3.5 era).  I can't remember the name of the game as I lost it when my backup battery died, but there is a game similar to the one I remember called <a href="http://www.microforuminternational.com/games_Sport_arcadesidegolf.html" target="_blank">[u]Arcade Sidegolf[u]</a> for newer mobile devices.  WARNING!  Although that linked page is safe, there are some NSFW games on other pages on that site!<br><br>Armitage:  I can remember when you first posted about this game a year or so back.  You have really made a lot of progress, and this is definitely one of the most unique and original looking games ever made in BlitzMax.  The graphics are stunning and fit the game perfectly.  Above all else, this game looks fun and is something I would play over and over!  I really look forward to purchasing this game. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
