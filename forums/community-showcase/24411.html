Right in front of the american pavilion was standing the russian one where the main attraction was Sputnik.<br><br>Tictactoe is to my opinion a game that is just funny to program AI for. Then to test the AI by playing against the computer. Remember "Wargames" the movie. Tictactoe is "nerdy". Altough I can remember vaguely a 3D tictactoe which was composed of 3 grids of 3x3 supperposed, you could make three in a line on the X,Y or Z axis (or diagonals).<br><br>All this to say that I see two "ideas" to enhance your game. Either put some of "the history of tictactoe" to it, or transform the game into something less minimal. I like it minimal (but then really rough ala "wargames") but it could evolve along with levels...<br><br>And I don't understand why there isn't a mode against the computer. You miss all the fun of it! Programming the "AI" (not sure you can say its AI!).<br><br>The game has a good graphic layout and I experienced no bugs, it is fun for 30 seconds (been programming a tictactoe myself). I see no point of making a multiuser out of it, I can play this on messenger with the whiteboard and I will see my oponent, I can chat with him and send him some files and pictures while playing. And even all of this doesn't make tictactoe really enjoyable for more than a few seconds.<br><br>In the tictactoe I programmed (it is a small subgame) the aim is to let the computer win (for this in the AI one of the "rules" to win has been disbled so that you have deliberately to let it win) then  the computer take control of the environment ...<br><br>for little stories read this also maybe some inspiration!<br><a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99994063" target="_blank">http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99994063</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Chatting is possible and it's the 3d experience that gives it an edge besides this is a game aimed @ children from to age of 5 to 9...<br><br>something of interest to you. When playing TTT players always have a starting strategy. Ive played my TTT alot and ivenarrowed it down to 2 main strategy's and he other usualy are counteredby other strategys and end in draw's. Now when creating an ai id have to checkcontinuesly of the 2 strategy's could be applies in anyway. and then let the ai react accordingly.....<br><br>all and all. thanks for the quick review.... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It is a very sleek design altough I think 5 to 9 years old audience are enjoying mario-kart clones, really things that build up reflex. Thus the aim of your game would be to learn these strategies to win.<br><br>Also I think the design (I mean graphic layout) is more intented for a web audience that likes stylish designs, certainly not a 5 to 9 audience.<br><br>You don't have pre calculate every possible move (this is the way it is teached in AI lessons I know) you can make a decision making loop (using the rules of your strategies f.e.). <br><br>You know its like in wargames when the hero puts his mark in the center spot and then the AI is crashing because it cannot win.

I understand that it is more intended for an internet audience. and that thisis in fact a lil boring with sleek design. your points are quite valid and i'll give it some tought to spice it up a bit.
