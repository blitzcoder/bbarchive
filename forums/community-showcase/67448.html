You start off on the runway.  A joystick is required btw.  There are some external views you can access by using joystick buttons 2,3, and 4 and also the hat switch allows you to look around when in the cockpit.<br><br>As you can see this is version .01.  Which means it's...basic and far from being the finished product.  If you feel the need to criticize then that's ok, knock yourself out.<br><br>Here's the key controls (they're not listed in the demo):<br><br>Joystick for aircraft control (very unrealistic atm)<br>Plus and Minus keys (+/-) for throttle<br>Joystick button 2 for out of cockpit view<br>Joystick button 3 for cockpit (hatswitch to look left right back etc)<br>Joystick button 4 for fly-by view<br>Spacebar to reset yourself to 0,your altitude,0<br>F key for flaps<br><br>Here's some tips:<br>1.  If you're easy on the controls you can get very realistic response.  You can crank it until you fall out of the sky.  I haven't modeled real flight controls yet.<br><br>2. For taking off, pitch the nose up to about 10 degrees AOA at around 120 knots.  That'll be a nice easy take off.<br><br>3. For the most realistic flight at this point, keep your airspeed above 250ish knots.  Anything lower and you need to baby the turns (no rudder physics atm).<br><br>4.  For landing do a few S-turns to bleed off airspeed or you can hit F for flaps. Level off and get your airspeed to around 115 knots and about 8 AOA for a nice soft landing.<br><br>That's about it for now.  I have to do some more research...I have a few bad numbers in there but it's still not bad.  Btw, there's absolutely no angular velocity calculations in it atm.  Keep that in mind please.<br><br>Enjoy.<br><br><a href="http://webzoom.freewebs.com/zamagames/TandemFlightEnginev01a.zip" target="_blank">http://webzoom.freewebs.com/zamagames/TandemFlightEnginev01a.zip</a><br><br><b>EDIT:</b> Just updated to v01a which allows arrow keys by hitting C and F1,F2, and F3 for views. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The aircraft is modeled at about 25,000 pounds and gravity is modeled at 9.8m/sec (1 unit = 1 meter).  The engine puts out a max of 25000 pounds of thrust so in essence, you'd have to put the nose straight up and you'd still not leave the ground or maybe ever so slightly.  So you can see from the above that lift is being applied.  And I'm using the actual lift formula L = Cl * blah blah blah.  What's <b>not</b> is actual flight surfaces so you can actually keep turning out of the flight envelope if you want to, that's why I was saying at this point to baby the flight controls when you're under 200 knots.  When I get actual flight controls in based on surface/airspeed/inertia and surface location from the CG, then it'll be more realistic on the controls.  There's no angular anything going on atm.  The turns are using TurnEntity, that's why you can do funky stuff atm.<br><br>Also, you can tell lift is being applied by turning the aircraft.  If there was no lift it'd just keep going straight and only turn based on thrust(which would be hardly noticeable).  Btw, MoveEntity is not being used.  It's all forces and PositionEntity.<br><br>I'll map the throttle to the mousewheel and repost, give me about 10 minutes.<br><br><b>EDIT:</b> Ok now the throttle is mapped to the + and - keys.

The latest version of which lets you pitch, yaw, and roll the boosters.  Angular velocity is also present but it's a hack.  However, I'm sure that creating the angular velocity could also be done in an abstract manner utilizing what Blitz gives us already.

I can try to throw together a text file so you can set your own stuff up it may be a bit though.  <br><br>At the moment there's no angular nothing modeled.  I do understand how it works though.  Each wing has an aileron that changes the angle of attack which shifts lift in the corresponding direction allowing roll.  I'm hoping to have this in soon but also allow it to be adjusted so a variety of aircraft can be modeled.  When I finally do get the vertical tail modeled, it will cure that nasty side slipping. =x<br><br>From what I've read about angular velocity I just have to get the position from CG that the force is acting and what direction it's acting relative to local aircraft orientation.  Inertia comes into play somewhere at this point.  Still sorting that one out.<br><br>Also in this version I cranked up lowered the flap drag a bit.  If you set the throttle to 5000 and hit F for flaps and keep airspeed around 120 by throttling up to 7500 every now and again, you can come in pretty decent.  Flare up a tad bit so aircraft mechanics like me don't have to change so many tires.<br><br><b>EDIT:</b> Just threw in stabilator movement. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
