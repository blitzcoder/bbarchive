That's the way "unlockable" shareware programs work. You would normally have some sort of "Register" button somewhere in your app that brings the user to some registration UI that requests a user ID (or serial number) and activation code. Then the DLL securely verifies the serial number to see if it correct for the given user ID.<br><br>Also, there's usually a "Buy" button where the user is directed to your website's purchase page where you might have it set up to e-mail purchasers correct registration codes. The purchase system could be done manually, where you manually e-mail each customer their keys (you generate them with the GenerateCode() DLL function), or you could embed the generation function in a PHP script (or however you want to automate it). That's why I'll send anyone the code if they want it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

What I meant was, if you have to pass the key into a function, that key must be a const in your program somewhere and thus if you viewed the .exe in a HEX editor you could find it!  Unless ... you actually generate the key via code somehow, then it could only be worked out by someone who had the source, especially now that you have encrypted the transfer to the dll.<br><br>Also I am very interested in having an automatic function to generate the keys online and send them back to the purchaser but I don't have a clue how to do this in PHP or CGI or whatever, look's like I need to do some reading up! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The only way to have complete security would be to upload the registration data to a server for authentication. But then... a hacker could possibly steal correct registrations being uploaded. I guess nothing's <i>completely</i> secure.<br><br>Beaker: I'm not sure exactly how programs like MoleBox embed files.

When you use an individual check it may be saver. EG: read every 100th int from the dll, add them all together and AND it with , say 29 bits, so you get a 29 bit checksum of frequenty controlled data. A Cracker would have to disassemble and understand this routine to create a checksum-corrected dummy dll.<br><br>And yes, maybe the CRC won't work when the dll is packed with Molebox. So you should make the CRC Check an option. Molebox has its own encryption, CRC Check and compression.<br><br>With a Molebox encrypted EXE it will also be virtually impossible to read out the secret key, at least with a hex editor. Of course, with a debugger that scans the memory it still can be done. Some Apps even crash a number of known debuggers to prevent such spy actions.<br><br>I think the goal is to make sure the App won't appear on warez and crackz lists. A simple solution would be (as soon as it becomes neccessary due to some degree of popularity) to release a number of serial numbers/codes for your App in the warez scene, so none will feel like there's a need to crack it. Those serials should then work for some time, after a couple of weeks they would crash the app by default. Well , just an idea. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This works well and doesn't inconvenience the customer unless he re-installs 15 times or installs it on 15 computers - at this point I'm sure requesting a new key won't be too much of an inconvenience. But BlitzKey isn't really a web-based registration system, so I don't think I'll be supporting this, not with BlitzKey, anyway. Although internet authentication like this more hacker-proof, it also inconveniences the customer if they don't have internet access on that particular computer.<br><br>I'll probably add an option to disable the CRC check soon, so it can be used with molebox or some other packer.

I don't think macs have DLL files, although there's probably some equivelant. BlitzKey uses only standard C function includes, like the string functions (actually just strlen() is used I think).

Although most firewalls will tell the user when an app tries to connect to the web, and if this happens during a registration process with a serial number taken from a warez site, it's likely the user will block web access. If you want to be able to have a frequently updated list of banned serials inside the app, you probably need to use some nasty tricks:<br><br>If your App or game allows to save data that is meant to be published on the internet, eg: savegame, exported stuff, screenshots etc. then hide the users registration code in an encrypted way inside the files. Obviously the encryption has to be absolutely bulletproof here.<br>Additionally the Game/app should feature frequent Software Updates that are absolutely vital, so most users will download and install them.  The Update Installer also transports an updated list of the banned serials, so running pirated copies can be recognized past registration.<br><br>My initial idea (providing some fake serials in the warez scene to make them think there's no need to upload cracks and real serials) is meant as something that will not be understood. The software will run ok for a while, so people will think everything is ok. After some time there's a bug and it won't run anymore. Probably there's some special error message, so when a user is asking a question like "Hi, I am using SoftThingy 2.0 but I have this errormessage ERROR 177AE - Abort, can somebody help me?" then you know the guy is using a pirated copy. Other than that I would not tell the guy that you know what's going on.<br><br>But hey, of course, this makes sense only when you have to take care not to loose millions of $.
