However, this is the first time I've seen the idea applied to an artillery game and, quite frankly, it's a stroke of genius. Like all good ideas, I'm amazed no one's thought of it before as it gives a simple game a whole new level of complexity. Great stuff!<br><br>Although I think it's pretty well formed as it is and there were no glitches or bugs that I could see, there were a couple of points I noticed:-<br><br>* I often found it a bit unclear as to which team mate was ready for action. Perhaps the player could emit a single visual 'sonar ping' when he becomes active. I think this would fit in with the style of the game quite well and make it more obvious as to who's next.<br><br>* I found the aiming gadget a bit fiddly. Perhaps make this bigger/longer? This would also improve resolution. Also, it appears to start at a random angle each time. Would restoring this to the last angle and power for each team mate make things too easy I wonder?<br><br>* The game doesn't seem to end? I know it's obvious who has won, but I want visual confirmation of my world domination, damn it!  ;o)<br><br><br>Oh, and I liked the music too. The laid back 'peace and love' hippy track is perfect for a game about genocide. :o)<br><br><br>About the Linux distro, may I recommend <a href="http://www.linuxmint.com/about.php" target="_blank"><b><u>Linux Mint</u></b></a>. I believe this is an ideal distro if you're coming to Linux from Windows as it's pretty much a Windowsy version of Ubuntu (10.04 is decidedly OSXy) that is ready to go straight out of the box, even more so than Ubuntu. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

A few people have mentioned not being able to see clearly which man is active. I'll be looking into ways to make it more obvious. I have a three colour rule for the game so it'll probably be some sort of flashing or animated solution. The shot power and angle is carried over from the last players go. I did this on purpose to force you to take each shot fresh, as opposed to being able to make tiny adjustment over several goes like some other artillery games do. About the 'Game Over' thing. This is going to sound really lame, but I couldn't work out a way to show who'd won that was understandable both ways up. All the controls are rotational ambigrams, and I didn't want to break that consistency. I also don't want to commit to giving the teams names like 'black or 'white' as there my be a colour variant at some point. I suppose I could make the winning team jump up and down. That might work. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You should do this. <br>So there would be two paths to an enemy - down if you can get a clear shot, or up and across if they're hard to get to.<br><br>I think you can break the rotational symmetry when the game is over - in fact the symmetry's already been broken because one side is dead and the winning team now lives in a world with a "correct" way up. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Unfortunately, having it start in a *seemingly* random position each turn makes things look pretty messy IMHO. Perhaps they could be reset to vertical for each turn? This would also give a nice visual reminder as to which way is 'up' for those lazy players that don't flip the screen each turn...<i>cough</i>...<br><br>The ending is a bit of an anticlimax at the moment and something definitely needs to be done about that. Even just stopping the player from taking shots would help as it just seems 'unfinished', even a bit bewildering, at the moment. I wasn't entirely sure if the game had really finished or there was some kind of bug the first time I played. The victory dance seems like a plan and maybe a musical sting or something? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Vertical at 50% power seems like a good default.<br><br>- The music was perfect for this type of game, IMO<br><br>- I think some simple "power-ups" would make the game cool.  For example, each game randomly place 1 or 2 items for either team to shoot at. Give them the power up if they shoot it. Power up ideas could be: <br>1) Trajectory preview (for one shot)<br>2) Larger impact area (for one shot)<br>3) Shot inversion (can shoot through the opposite color space for one shot)<br>etc...<br><br>- I think with some polished graphics, this could be a really incredible game.
