When I first saw this I laughed. This is a cool and original idea. I did think it was a game at first, and was looking at the screenshot for ways to understand how it might play ... figured you maybe controlled ALL the people kinda like a `highrise lemmings` game. It's neat and definitely has potential!<br><br>I agree there should be obscure farts and corresponding reactions (ie farts increase the lift-emptying rate). I haven't watched the demo yet but I hope you get some lifts that break down for maintenance once in a while? I agree a stairwell is needed for the impatient folks. When people get involved in a conversation with each other there should be  a chance that they don't realize the lift arrived and then get frustrated. Do you have people also sitting down and going to sleep? Also caterers going in and out with carts of food, and post-delivery people shuttling their little post carts around? Maybe you can also create families where the whole family has to end up on the same floor and they might get separated, and then as one person from the family goes to meet with the others they miss each other by taking separate lifts or something. Maybe also the lights go out sometimes and the bulbs have to be replaced. And maybe when the lift doors open to let the people out, they should have a new and unusual pose on their face which you can use to allude to what just happened inside. Half naked bodies? people crying? laughing? saying nothing? holding their nose? etc.<br><br>Cool! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This is getting scary. Hospital lifts must be the worst on the planet. :)<br>By the way, I checked out your lift game idea and think it's great! Fabulous illustrations too! I like the idea of a 'patience meter' and giving full control of the lift to the player. Your ideas are far more fully formed as an interactive game and I think you should definitely go ahead and create it. Please don't let the arrival of 'Sim Lift' deter you in any way - it was only meant as a fun little exercise in programming to become more acquainted with Blitz. Who knows, perhaps we could work together on 'Sim Lift 2'?<br><div class="quote"> I must admit was sort of relieved to see that there's still room for my more management-oriented take on it <br></div><br>Indeed yes! 'Sim Lift is just a skeleton for something much bigger and better. There's so many more elements that could be implemented to form a fully-functioning and entertaining management type game. :)<br><div class="quote"> are you going to be turning it into more of a game, though, Drekkin, or expanding it with more stuff in the same sort of hands-off, highly entertaining 'fish-tank' direction? <br></div><br>Hmm.. well it wasn't my intention for 'Sim Lift' to be anything more than a 'fish-tank'. My inspiration for this stems from watching people in real life going about their everyday business. For example, how staff at a cafeteria interact with their workplace and customers (eg. taking orders, preparing food, cleaning up spillages, walking back and forth from counter to tables with trays, dealing with complaints, mood changes, personality types etc.) 'Sim Cafe' here I come.. hehe. All of these elements make for a compelling programming study, of which 'Sim Lift' is my first (although a highly simplified one). Making such passive simulations and just sitting and observing the unpredictable nature of events and outcomes is fascinating in itself but to go further and make it into a fully interactive game can only increase the entertainment value, not to mention the longevity.<br>My plan for now though is to start working on a different project altogether, a unique tetris-style puzzle game, which I'm rather excited about. Hopefully in the future I'll attempt 'Sim Lift 2' as a fully interactive game, that is, unless someone else beats me to it. ;) <br><br><br>Funky Frank,<br><div class="quote"> Looking forward to v2 with random noxious smells - everyone looking at everyone else accusingly, and the odd overloaded lift plunging to the basement. <br></div><br>Haha... great ideas, especially the noxious smells. I could introduce a fart-o-meter which measures each person's level of consciousness and when they're likely to pass out. :)<br><br><br>cermit,<br><div class="quote">  Very nice! Although i would like to follow the elevator behind the wall. Other than that it was just fine :) <br></div><br>This was my initial intention but realised it would look rather odd, so I decided to leave it out.<br><br><br>AngelDaniel,<br>Hehe.. more great ideas. If 'Sim Lift 2' ever comes along you can be sure it will include every situation imaginable. :)<br><div class="quote"> I agree there should be obscure farts and corresponding reactions (ie farts increase the lift-emptying rate). <br></div><br>Especially this one. :)<br><br><br>Rottbott,<br><div class="quote"> It could be made more efficient - sometimes both lifts go to the same floor for one person, even though people are waiting on other floors and one of the lifts is empty. <br></div><br>It certainly could! Partway through the coding process I sort of lost focus on the lifts being efficient and began concentrating on the people aspect. We all know though that no set of lifts is efficient. :)<br><br><br>sswift,<br><div class="quote"> These are ELEVATORS, not LIFTS! <br></div><br>Here in Australia, we call an elevator a "lift". We also say "Need a lift?" when offering to drive someone somewhere.<br><div class="quote"> Also, I have to ask, does the G there stand for Ground, or Garage? Because I've never seen a building where the second floor is labeled 1. :-) <br></div><br>G stands for Ground. You think a second floor labelled '1' is confusing? The ground floor of the hospital I work at is labelled '5'!<br><br><br>Elf,<br><div class="quote"> How about reading the user's Outlook address book where present, and naming the people in the sim after them? It would be a laugh to see some of my friends and colleagues stomping off in frustration. <br></div><br>lol.. how about the little sim people parading around with your friends heads in animated photographic form? hehe.. :) You could enter in personality details, traits, mood triggers etc. Better still, the lift lobby is a network server; when you log in you see yourself walking around and can interact with others. Ok, this is getting out of control. :)<br><br><br>jhocking,<br><div class="quote"> Cool idea for a game/demo, and I love the look you've achieved. <br></div><br>Wow, I'm surprised to receive praise for my graphical achievements. I've always thought my graphics are quite primitive, what with their cartoon-style black outlines and simple colours and textures.<br>I guess it's an improvement from my previous gaming graphics (see <a href="http://member.telpacific.com.au/drekinn/santas_mixup" target="_blank"><b>Santa's Mix-Up</b></a> for an example).<br>Thanks for the compliment! :)<br><br><br>enidox,<br><div class="quote"> Something that is second nature to gamers and non-gamers alike and hasn't been done before. <br></div><br>Hasn't been done before?
