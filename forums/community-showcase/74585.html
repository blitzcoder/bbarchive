The first few levels have a quick notice about things that can be done. I wish I'd thought it out a bit better to be honest. I just started it off to see if I could make something like Crayon Physics. Was quite a fun little project to start with but it got a bit messy and complicated towards the end. Still, I'm quite happy with it and it gave me an excuse to get my website done.<br><br>I am thinking of making a new drawing type game at some point. I'll plan it out better next time ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
