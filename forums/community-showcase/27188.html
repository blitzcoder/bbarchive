The alpha skidmarks can be drawn permanently all over the circuit, and more importantly, circuits can be 100 customized without hardly any limitations. Tiles really (really) restrict the layout of tracks. Unfortunately it eats up quite a bit of memory however.<br><br>The game resolution can be selected, 640x480, 800x600 or 1024x768, at 16 or 32 bit.<br><br>Framerates: on my PC (2.6GHz P4) it's running with all the features at highest resolution at 120Hz, with much time to spare. On an older PC, 333MHz with TNT2 graphics card, the game runs att full framerate (only tested at 75Hz) with most features enabled.<br><br>Camera is locked on the car, but at full framerate it looks quite smooth. I will also implement a smooth option that curves the movement a bit.<br><br>Transparency, the only way I could solve it dast enough was using the "every other pixel" method. Unfortunately the smoke flickers sometimes, due to this, but I'm working on some fixes for that. I also considered using 3D on 2D to get alpha transparent smoke, but decided against it for a number of reasons.<br><br>=) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I worked around the problem at the moment by using an array instead of an anim image for the car rotations. But I was so keen to see that bug being fixed as it was the only one that has really been getting on my nerves! Also, what's new in the updates of B+ since the release?<br><br>Space_guy &gt;&gt; Thanx =)<br><br>Paradox &gt;&gt; I also heard about the graphics corruption for some graphics cards. It's nothing I've experienced on any the machines its been tested on, but I fear that people using those cards may not have enough VRam to play the game anyway. I would say 8MB is minimum, but to get the goodness out of the game, 32 and up is recommended.<br><br>I'm using a second image for collision (black and white), or two should I say for upper and lower levels as the original circuit image isn't suitable for collision detection. I also scale the bump images down 50% to save some memory and to make collisions faster. Again, imagine if the bump maps could be saved in convensional RAM, using one bit per pixel... now that I would love and so would people with less VRam! The collision engine now seems to work fine, it's pixel perfect (agaist cars, fences, houses, etc) and fast without bugs (I think =) It's imagescollide behind the scenes by the way, and not readpixel.<br><br>The game has it's own VRam manager, if a circuit is being loaded and you run out of Vram, you'll be presented with some options to save memory for the round and relaunch. This includes, changing screen res, bit depth, visual damage, trackside features, car details etc. You can also choose that opponents all look the same and grey to save a massive amount of memory.<br><br>Internet Play will be using surreal's latest library.<br><br>I will do extensive testing with BlitzPlus soon, then compare the performance results and go for the fastest one.<br><br>A "behind" the scenes documentary could be cool =) I'd say the hardest bit so far was the collision engine and the AI for the computer cars. It was difficult to make the collisions slide the cars rather than totally stop them against a fence, and even more difficult to combine collisions with the circuit bump map with the other 7 cars to ensure that they never overlap and get totally stuck. Getting the collisions work good over the internet and LAN will be even more of a challenge. I've done some testing with internet play successfully, but I've decided to re-implement the network support using a better approach. Priority of headaches so far:<br>1) BlitzBasic bug with imagescollide for animated images, I've spend hours and hours trying to locate and work around this bug in BB.<br>2) Computer AI<br>3) Collisions<br>4) Getting it to run smooth and the same at different frequencies<br>5) Maybe internet play? This could climb.<br><br>Finally, for the resolution. The game will not re-scale for graphic modes, and this is by design. I know some people would like the cars to be bigger, so 640x480 will offer larger cars and more panning of the map where as 1024x768 will naturally have smaller cars and less panning.<br><br>Thanks for showing interest =)<br><br>Stefan <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
