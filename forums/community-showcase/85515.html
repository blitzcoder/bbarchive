I came second in my second race on track 2 with a time of 1:50 on Easy.  I needed to have the camera at it's highest though.  <br><br>*  The default key of left shift for the firing can invoke the old 'sticky keys' issue.  I know you can re-define them so this is a non-issue.<br><br>*  You need to store the cursor position before changing a key and reset it afterwards.<br><br>* Not sure if you support joypads but if not, may be worth considering.<br><br>* I think the track needs to stand out more from the background so that it's easier to see where you're going.  It's too distracting for me to look at the map.<br><br>* I think you should bounce off the barriers better ( i.e. just reflect the velocity with the collision normals and reduce the resulting vector ).  It's too harsh at the moment and can be quite frustrating when you get pushed back the way you came.  <br><br>* Like the pit - same a wipeout if I remember.<br><br>* I had a quick play of the editor but wasn't sure what I was doing.  Best to add some instructions on there as I just made a mess ;)  You should be able to get the AI to automatically create the racing line, given the tiles.  I find having to place these a pain in the arse and trial and error.<br><br>* Nice retro sounds &amp; robo voices - can I ask how you made them?<br><br>All in all, pretty good.<br><br>Stevie <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This is more than a lil jarring when it happens, and is a shame given how relatively straightforward it is to fix.  Here's hoping we've caught it in time, this time.<br><br>Apart from that, it seems to be a lot of fun.  I agree that the bouncing off the walls is a bit harsh in a harsh-to-the-detriment-of-fun level.  Perhaps (as suggested above) slow them but maintain the 'forward momentum' - the racing's so tight generally that you're going to be struggling to recover from it anyway, let along being made to head backwards for a moment.<br><br>Good stuff.  I'm off to play more. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Now this is fine - good, even - but it meant it was very difficult to look waaaay up to the top of the screen to see what powerup I'd collected.  I often had no idea until I got to a long-ish straight, since the time it took to look that far away from my ship meant I'd be hitting a wall in no time.<br><br>If you could think of some way to have some sort of visual indicator (preferably) on or near one's ship, that might make the whole race a lil more fluid and immersive. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I felt the controls were just about right although I did prefer a car/ship with good handling. Will you be able to upgrade over the course of a tournament? If not then the tracks will have to be balanced so that there's enough straights/corners to balance things out between the different car set ups. <br><br>I could only come second in normal mode after a good few attempts but that may be about right, didn't try the hardest mode yet.<br><br>I agree with LineOf7s about the weapon pick-ups, I did hear the weapon pick ups but it wasn't always clear. I would actually specify the pick ups on the track so you can go for the pick ups you need, like a shield if you're in the lead, it might create a bit more strategy in the races. Maybe even design the tracks so that the more powerful pick ups are off the racing line so you have to lose a bit of race time to pick them up.<br><br>Maybe you have already but all of the pick ups shot forwards (except the mines), it would be nice for some weapons to have shot backwards at pursuing cars.<br><br>So far so good, will keep an eye on this one :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I don't *think* it was you though - it could have been some driver anomaly here, so bear it in mind but don't lose any sleep over it just yet.<br><br>With the voices a bit more within the realm of understandability, it was better - but not *good*.  In the middle of the race I still couldn't make out exactly what she was telling me I'd picked up.  I could hear other things... but I guess I'm more used to this sort of information really smacking me right in the face.  Perhaps it's just personal preference.<br><br>[edit] Okay, interesting tidbit:  I'm running a Soundblaster X-Fi in 5.1 surround, and in that mode (which is standard), it seems the majority of the sound effects (including *all* the speech) is coming out of the right-rear speaker (only).  Explains why it's not quite as in-your-face as I expected.  I checked it out to make sure everything was in order, and yes, it's just this game that's doing it.  Hopefully that information can be of some use to you. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
