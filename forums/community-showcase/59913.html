It wasn't particularly interesting or exciting, it was too reminiscent of Shiny, and I couldn't come up with any good logos for it.  In addition, the domain had already been registered, and some other group of people had started using that name for their own games!<br><br>So I needed something that sounded fun, and exciting, and lent itself to a good logo, which nobody had registered the domain for already, and which nobody was using.  It also needed to be easy to remember, and short.  <br><br>Being related to games or software was a low priority... There are lots of companies out there with names that have nothing at all to do with games.  I could always stick "Games" or "Entertainment" on the end.<br><br>I'd tried hundreds of different names in the past, looking up words in the dictionary, finding synonyms of various words like "fun" or "powerful", going to domain registration sites that tell you names that recently became available that have the word "game" in them.  But the names I came up with were either lame or boring, or too long, or taken, or the domains wrere registered but not being used by people who wanted throusands of dollars for them.<br><br>Then a couple nights ago I was watching TV and inspiration hit me.  I realised the name was short, fun, and was synonymous with clever and swift. (heh)  It was a bit quirky sounding as well which makes it easy to remember.  And it also meant that it was unlikely to be registered.  So  dashed off to my PC (which is two feet away from the couch) and a quick domain search, and I discovered the name was available!  Woo!<br><br>So I present to you <a href="http://www.raccoonrocket.com" target="_blank">my new company name and website.</a>  The only thing there right now is the logo I just finished making.  I hope you like it! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'm proud of it I think it came out looking great.  Adding a character to it will be nice, but I think it came out realyl sharp looking.  I spent a few hours on it and went though a thousand fonts and whittled them down to 15 or so which I then went through and eliminated one by one till I had maybe 8 or so, and then the one I have here stood out as the best one, though I had to edit some of the letters.  <br><br>Btw, did you notice the word raccoon in the logo has stripes which suggest the tail of a raccoon?  I tried lots of variations on that.  The whole logo is just a bit of an accident really, I just keep trying stuff till something looks good. That's usually how I do art.  The first iterations had white outlines, and a smooth gradient from top to bottomm, I also tried normal bevels, but the bevel with both sides being lightened plus an inner glow looked the most unique and professional.<br><br><br>Oh and speaking of "why raccoon"...  I always wondered why Valve chose the name Valve.  It's a pretty boring name, and a pretty boring object.  Also, there's a company called "Double Fine", who got their name from seeing a sign on the highway that indicated speeding fines were doubled in that area.  Lionhead on the other hand is the name of Peter Moleneuax's hamster. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
