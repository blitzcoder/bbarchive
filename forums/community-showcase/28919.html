I like that it reacts, but it's too much and it gets in the way of aiming.<br><br>4) The bad guys take a LOT of punishment, even with the serious weapons. I mean 2 seconds with a chaingun tearing through their midriff and they're still firing.<br><br><br>That seems kinda negative, so I'll point out some things I really like too<br><br>1) The mouse smoothing is great.

It shows both how capable you are, and how capable blitz is. I certainly respect this work.<br><br>(Oh, and Wow! Decals on the people...err...corpses. Am I seeing things??)<br><br>The water effect is beautiful.<br>The style and textures give the map such depth.<br>The doors are done well.<br>The crates look great.<br>And so many other things...but you know that already.<br><br><br><br>Now for the constructive criticism, baring in mind i've already said this is amazing :P<br><br>- Stand on something and jump so you hit the roof, and you pause mid-air matrix style. (You can even walk across the roof!)<br><br>- Pick up items/activate switches - I think it works really well that you have to click on it, rather than run through it. However it's too precise... Would be better if the click was registered anywhere within the crosshairs circle<br><br>- Strafing would benefit by a 'slight' speed increase<br><br>- (Nitpicking) Where there are 3 health boxes stacked up, take the bottom 2 away and the top one floats<br><br>- You can jump on things outside and walk across the top of the maze. This would be fine, however it lets you see into the rest of the level.<br><br>- No jumping allowed on the elevator/lift (I understand why it's like this...however it would be more realistic if you worked this out)<br><br>- If you start the elevator while you're not on it and walk under it, you are automatically moved to be standing on it. Same for if you are on the platform above and it is coming up and you walk off the cliff<br><br>- The marble texture seems out of place/character (to me)...not exactly sure what would make it seem right though...<br><br>- AI/Paths - I know very well this area is difficult. What you've done with the defined paths works well, however I'd like to comment that it seems the opponents don't pick the right direction to go to reach you. Too often do they tend to run away for no reason<br><br>- Crosshairs reaction is great however the zoom is too much...maybe zoom to half the size?<br><br>- The grass is really nice, however it doesn't seem right that you collide with it. This is especially true since its backface disappears and you can walk through it from that direction<br><br>- You should probably run slower while crouching<br><br><br><br>(Side comment, I have to complement you on removing the decals on the walls that you blow up. I was so expecting them to still be floating there! :D)<br><br>Keep up the great work! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Possibly a green cross in the center and a black circle around the outside.<br><br>Also, the options settings should be saved to a file when you return from the options menu so that changes are persistant. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
