Press &lt;Ctrl+X&gt; to exit the game instantly.
</pre><br><br>The Game Framework is a couple of files that you can use in your games to ensure that they have everything you'd expect from a professional game such as: dynamic full-screen/windowed mode, totally smooth fixed rate logic timing, proper mouse cursor handling, ini file support etc.  There's tons of stuff in it; take a look at the readme in the codebox at the end of this post.<br><br>I've spent countless boring and painful hours researching, programming and testing all the things that I think are important for a professional game to have and included them in this Game Framework so that you don't have to go through the same hassle I did!  I'll be using this Game Framework for my next match-3 game, commissioned by an American company, which will be on all the major portals.<br><br>I'm selling this framework for $39 (U.S. Dollars) for a royalty free commercial licence.  You can use the source code as you see fit for as many games as you like but you mustn't make it public.  The Game Framework source code is well commented and I'll give you the source code for this demo as well which shows you how to use it.

Note: You might get vertical tearing if you have switched Vsync Off in your video card drivers.<br>2)	Press F to dynamically switch to windowed mode.  Notice how everything is still smooth and the same speed.  If you see any vertical tearing, this is a BlitzMax/DirectX/OpenGL issue that Skidracer is looking into.

Blitz Max Game Framework V0.9
=============================

(c) 2006 Grey Alien Games

Last Revision: 20/04/06


Introduction
------------

The game framework is a set of objects and useful functions that
allow your game to do everything that you'd expect to see in a
professional commericial game.


Conditions of Use
-----------------

If you have purchased this Game Framework, you may use it
(or portions of it) royalty free for commerical use (however,
the source code must not be made public).


Example Framework
-----------------

The example framework provided shows:

- Files to Include
- Constants to declare
- How to initialise TGame
- A basic game loop that uses TGame
- Example functions to show how to call TGame methods


Common Code
-----------

As well as the TGame object (see below), a file called
CommonCode.bmx is included.  This contains many useful functions
as well as the crucial ScreenWidth and ScreenHeight global
variables.


TGame Object
------------

The main object is TGame.  It encapsulates all of the game
framework global variables and global objects.

TGame, and other objects, can be found in CommonTypes.bmx

TGame supports the following:

*Timing*

- Extra smooth Fixed Rate Logic (an alternative to Delta Timing).
  Your game will run the same speed on all systems regardless of
  refresh rate/VSync and in windowed or full-screen mode.
- If anything occurs which causes a big delay, such as loading
  music or changing screen mode or dragging the window etc., the
  Fixed Rate Logic will reset its timing variables to avoid any
  skipping caused by the time delay.

*Full-Screen/Windowed Mode*
- Switch between full-screen and windowed mode easily on-the-fly.
- Automatically chooses graphics mode.  Will reduce from
  full-screen 32-bit to 16-bit, then to windowed mode, and
  will finally error nicely if nothing is supported.
- DirectX rendering lag has been fixed.
- Option to prevent vertical tearing in windowed mode (on some
  systems).
- Windowed mode has minimise button.
- Windowed mode has a working close button.
- The window is automatically centred on the desktop.
- When game is minimised or focus is lost (even in full-screen
  mode) the game and music are paused, yet the screen will still
  redraw to avoid Windows overwriting it.  The game and music
  will resume when the window is restored or refocused.
- When the game is in windowed mode and the user clicks in
  another window, the game and music will pause and the screen
  will display "Paused" until the user clicks back in the window.
- Moving the mouse onto the title bar will show the default
  Windows cursor so that you can click on minimise and close etc.
  This is NOT default Blitz Max behaviour!

*Icon*
- Icon will show on title bar, task bar, and when alt+tabbing.
- Exe can have icon built in (needs some external work)

*Ini File*

- Important variables are stored in an auto-generated,
  auto-repairing ini file.  This means that you can save options
  such as Full Screen On/Off, Music and Sound volumes, Particle
  Quality etc. and have them load in each time the game is run.
  The ini file is automatically updated whenever a user changes
  an ini variable, such as when they change screen mode or
  volume etc.

*Debug*

- Display Debug variables anywhere on-screen, including:
	- Logic Time
	- Draw Time
	- FPS
	- Desktop Hz
	- Game Hz
	- Fixed Rate Logic Ticks
	- Lag Fix (on/off)
	- Flip mode (-1,0,1)
	- Fast (on/off)
	- Slow Motion (on/off)
	- VSync (on/off)
	- Memory Allocated
	- Music Volume (0-100)
	- Sound Volume (0-100)
- FPS Counter.
- Fast on/off toggle.  Good for testing maximum frame rate.
- Slow Motion mode. Runs at 25% (or user-defined speed), good
  for testing movement and animation.
- Toggle Direct X Lag Fix
- Toggle Flip modes

*Functionality*

- Screenshot with F12.
- Quick Exit key for developers.
- Toggle VSync On/Off (user can do this)
- Boss Key automatically minimises and pauses game and music, even
  in full-screen mode.
- Sound and music on/off hot keys.
- Adjust music volume and sound volume separately.
- Pause Key.  Also pauses and resumes music (if any is playing).
  Also shows a paused image on-screen (if an image is assigned).
- Protection against two copies of game running at once.

*Other Useful Types*
- TMousePointer handles loading a cursor, getting mouse values
  once per logic loop (to ensure constant coords and button
  readings), supports offsets for where point is not in top left,
  and slides the game cursor smoothly off the edges of the window
  instead of leaving it at the last known position.
- TSprite includes animation capability.
- TButton with mouse-over graphic, sound and management code.
- TGameSound incorporates name, pitch and volume.
- TSoundBank for easy storage and retrieval of sounds.
- TGameImage incorporates name, width and height.
- TImageBank for easy storage and retrieval of images.

*Splash screens*
- Splash screen with fade image and sound in/out functionality.
- Support for a publisher/portal splash screen.

*Loading screen*
- Loading screen with a loading bar supported.
- After Loading is complete, the loading bar is optionally
  replaced with a "Click here to play" button.


Future Possibilities
--------------------

The following may be supported shortly:
- Array of balanced sound channels.
- Particle effects
- Player profiles and management of profiles.
- Mouse over menu items
- Options screen
- Mac and Linux support!

For now the Game Framework is Windows PC only.<br><br>Kuron: Thanks for your input, I can't give it away for free unfortunately.  I've priced it so that it's good value for commercial games.  If someone had offered me this code before I started, I'd have paid $200 dollars for it just because time is money, and it took a lot of time!  If people want their freeware games to look good, then the code is good value, if they are not worried then fine.<br><br>Xlsior: sorry, that was dumb of me, I've edited the post.  Use arrow keys to move and press Z to shoot!<br><br>Shambler: Thanks for your input.  I'm disappointed to find that it's not behaving properly on your PC.  I wish I could see it in action.  It sounds like the video card is doing something odd like rendering the previous frame. Certainly there is nothing in the code to make them skip backwards!  Glad it's OK in windowed mode.  What video card do you have?  Also do you have VSync turned on or off in your drivers?<br><br>Cygnus: Hmm, that's interesting, perhaps the shapes are not skipping back but merely the game is hanging for a split second thus displaying one frame for longer.  The game logic should catch up however and move the sprites a bit further the next frame to compensate. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Here's an interesting test, try blowing things up and see if mid explosion the explosion every goes back to a previous frame (i.e. becomes bigger).  This might be hard to spot because the explosions stay on the same frame for a while before moving onto the next one, unlike the moving sprites, which always move each frame.<br><br>Ooh, one more thing, if you press D for debug mode and then L for slow motion, do you still see the glitch?<br><br>So I'm correct in thinking that ALL the sprites jump at the same time, yes?

My timing routines in the main demo are Refresh Rate Independent and work perfectly smoothly (on the right video card) no matter what the refresh rate.  It's been designed that way.  The jerkyness we are seeing on these 6800s and my laptop appears even with that extremely simple code sample I posted above where the object moves a set (non variable) amount each frame (an integer number, not even a float!).  Now if the frames are rendered in sync with the display (which BlitzMax/BlitzPlus is supposed to do for you) there shouldn't be any jerkyness but there is on some PCs and not on others.  So somehow BlitzMax is not syncing with the display on all PCs, don't know why.  In a sense you are right, the timing is out with the sync of the hz of the display, but in that simple example it's not "my timing" it's just a very simple method that should be fine. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So the anti-lag code is causing jerkiness on your screen. GREAT :-(.  I'll have to try out Indiepath's alternative anti-lag code.  When the Fix Lag =1 is when you have jerks, right?  And that is when the video card is forced to quickly render all the frames in it's pipeline. It more likely the difference in fan speed is the graphics card fan or CPU fan speeding up actually not slowing down (unless you've checked this with that SpeedFan program (or similar)).<br><br>Btw, it's not a bug that the Desktop and Game Hz are different, it just records the desktop Hz beforehand and then switches to 60Hz for the game.<br><br>So you have a CRT, that blows up my TFT theory (sorta) but I know that smooth movement is probably going to look dodgy on TFTs anyway from what I've read.<br><br>OK so the code sample works fine, it has no anti lag code.

Here are my conclusions:<br><br>1) On two 19" TFTs the demo was perfectly smooth in full-screen mode.  One had a slight vertical tearing every so often.<br><br>2) On all PCs, windowed mode had vertical tearing.  This is a Blitz Max issue which has been posted in the bugs forum.  However, it should be noted that the demo ran smoothly with no jerks.<br><br>3) I tested on a PC with a 15" and a Geforce Ti4200. This card is the previous generation to the 6800 I believe.  Anyway, it exhibited symptoms that sound very like Shamblers i.e. smooth but with big jerks about every 0.8 seconds or so.  In windowed mode it was perfectly smooth but with some vertical tearing.<br><br>So it looks like Shambler's issue is a Geforce issue and this is not the same issue as older TFTs showing jerkiness (like my laptop).  Dumbly I didn't test the demo where the Lag Fix can be turned off on the Geforce Ti4200, but will do ASAP to see if it helps.<br><br>So as for jerkiness on old TFTs, there is really nothing than can be done about this esp. as it works fine on newer TFTs.  If some TFTs show the odd bit of vertical tearing in full-screen mode, again this is a driver issue and can't be fixed.<br><br>I'm going to look into the lag fix problem some more because it may be solvable.  At the moment it a case of lag or jerks, both are not good!  I'm wondering if it occurs because the logic loop does a whole load of rendering that never makes it to the screen, then the lag fix suddenly catches up of some cards, thus making a jerk.<br><br>If anyone else can test this demo, I'd really appreciate it.

What I mean is for some reason it doesn't want to supply those modes for my BlitzMax framework.<br><br>Basically it has some BlitzMax code that checks to see if 800x600x32 @ 60Hz exists in your graphics card drivers, and if not, it looks for 16 bit, and failing that it does windowed mode.  Then it sets a flag that stops you from trying again.  When you say it tries to change mode, what it does is end the current graphics window, then runs the checks and goes, "oh can't change" and just makes the graphics window again.  It could not destroy it until it knows better I guess, but that's minor compared to why it doesn't work in 800x600 on your card which should support it.  I'll post a test exe in a minute that DOESN'T check for the mode first, it just goes straight into it.  If you can test that it'd be great thanks.<br><br>Btw, I've tested it with an 800x600 desktop it's fine. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So anti-lag made a difference on framework 2.

This shows an inconsistancy or randomness with the Geforce cards.<br><br>So when LagFix is off (0) you say it was a little better, this means you still had some problems?  People with Geforce so far have reported perfectly smooth once LagFix is off and when on (1) ALL the UFOs seem to jerk at once, around once per second.

In both framework examples (and with both at anti-lag set to 0 and 1) I didn't noticed any improvements.   <br><br>I then switched the vertical sync setting to off.  There was still quite a lot of jerkiness in full screen mode, with anti-lag set to both 0 and 1, but it didn't seem quite so severe.

In framework 2, for example,  most of the UFOs were fairly smooth; only some were affected.  Same thing with the Vsync problem - only two or three out of all the UFOs displayed the Vsync issue at any one time.   <br><br>As mentioned in your original post, it does indeed seem like the Vsync problem is more likely to occur on the faster moving UFOs.<br><br>Forgot to mention I am using a 17inch TFT screen.

More great info thanks.  So if Vsync isn't off we know that's not the problem for you.<br><br>Regarding not all UFOs jerking at once, the Vsync "line" is only at one place on the screen and it often moves around so it will only affect a few UFOs, and mainly the faster ones as you have correctly identified.<br><br>Regarding them not all jerking at once, I wonder if it's just the faster onces and the jerking is a TFT issue this time.  I'm sure getting confused now for sure, but thanks for testing.<br><br>Oh yeah the demos are DirectX driver, that's why I've got the lag fix in there because it's a DirectX only issue.

While playing in full screen I noticed that things started to get very very jerky.  This jerking effect doesn't seem to have any kind of time pattern associated with it.<br><br>I thought the jerkiness in full screen was a bit odd as you seemed to iron out those issues with the tests from the weekend. <br><br>I ran task manager.  What I noticed is when your demo runs in full screen the CPU usage goes up to 96% - 97%.    Also, maybe every now and again there is an ever so slight pause/stutter in the music.  This stutter last for a second or two at the most.<br><br>Upon switching to windowed mode (or running from scratch in windowed mode)  CPU usage for the demo is at  a max of 10% (averages at about 6%).  Also, in windowed mode, there is no stuttering effect of the music i and the screen refresh is always nice and smooth.<br><br>I have run the demo several times to make sure this happens every time.  <br><br>Is the something which is common with BlitzMax games?<br><br>Maybe some of the others who have tested your demo could look for this behaviour too.<br><br>Edit - Thought I would mention it.  I am running Windows XP 32-bit edition, but my CPU is a AMD Athlon 64bit.  Not sure if that may be causing this issue.<br><br>Edit 2 - @Grey.  As another test, I ran your framework4 demo from the weekend and that didn't generate the constant 97% CPU usage problem this new aotmg example exhibits. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Input is good as it makes for a better engine.  The problem is, my engine's timing is simple and effective.  All the problems we are seeing are the way the BMax is interacting with different hardware.<br><br>OK re: the CPU thing and stuttering, I have a theory!  The CPU use is only 50% on mine (P4) but someone commented that on AMD CPUs you need to put in a Delay(1) (or more) or something to allow the CPU to do stuff for Windows.  Maybe your Windows is desperately trying to do something in its 3% CPU timeslot and when it finally gets the CPU it grabs it for too long thus resulting in stuttering.  <br><br>As for why the Framework4 works and the new AOTMG one doesn't hmm, it uses the same lag fix code, did you switch that on (with A) on Framework 4 to compare because it's always on in AOTMG?  Maybe the lag fix code is maxing out the AMD CPU?  Also AOTMG is doing a bit more (drawing a background and score etc) but I'm not sure this is enough to mess it up BUT it is playing music.  Press M to kill the music.  Does this improve the stuttering?  Try exiting and going back in (the music will remain off due to the ini file) and see if it's better.  Any help you can offer is really appreciated.  I'll look into the delay thing.<br><br>Shambler, that's intentional actually, because it HAS to go to windowed mode before it can minimise.

In fact, the CPU usage is fairly constant at around 10% for both.  There are a few spikes every now and again where it jumps up to around 30% usage but it very quickly goes back down again. <br><br>With AOTMG, there is no noticable difference when switching off the music.  In full screen mode there is an initial drop of about 20% CPU usage when initially turning off the music but it soon shoots back up to 97% again.<br><br>Again, with AOTMG in windowed mode the CPU usage is a tiny fraction  compared to full screen mode.<br><br>What you may find interesting (then again, possible not!!) is when AOTMG is showing those initial splash/intro screens there CPU usage doesn't shoot up to 97%.  It only does that once the main game starts. <br><br><br>I kind of agree with Boiled Sweets.  I think the lesson is don't buy BlitzMax at the moment if you are a AMD Athlon 64, nVidia 6xxx GFX card owner!! LOL.  Just kidding. Seriously though, as Grey says, it seems people are giving BlitzMax a good going over and all the issues are now starting to come out.

*Timing*

- Extra smooth Fixed Rate Logic (an alternative to Delta Timing).
  Your game will run the same speed on all systems regardless of
  refresh rate/VSync and in windowed or full-screen mode.
- If anything occurs which causes a big delay, such as loading
  music or changing screen mode or dragging the window etc., the
  Fixed Rate Logic will reset its timing variables to avoid any
  skipping caused by the time delay.

*Full-Screen/Windowed Mode*
- Switch between full-screen and windowed mode easily on-the-fly.
- Automatically chooses graphics mode.  Will reduce from
  full-screen 32-bit to 16-bit, then to windowed mode, and
  will finally error nicely if nothing is supported.
- DirectX rendering lag has been fixed.
- Option to prevent vertical tearing in windowed mode (on some
  systems).
- Windowed mode has minimise button.
- Windowed mode has a working close button.
- The window is automatically centred on the desktop.
- When game is minimised or focus is lost (even in full-screen
  mode) the game and music are paused, yet the screen will still
  redraw to avoid Windows overwriting it.  The game and music
  will resume when the window is restored or refocused.
- Moving the mouse onto the title bar will show the default
  Windows cursor so that you can click on minimise and close etc.
  This is NOT default Blitz Max behaviour!

*Icon*
- Icon will show on title bar, task bar, and when alt+tabbing.
- Exe can have icon built in (needs some external work)

*Ini File*

- Important variables are stored in an auto-generated,
  auto-repairing ini file.  This means that you can save options
  such as Full Screen On/Off, Music and Sound volumes, Particle
  Quality etc. and have them load in each time the game is run.
  The ini file is automatically updated whenever a user changes
  an ini variable, such as when they change screen mode or
  volume etc.

*Debug*

- Display Debug variables anywhere on-screen, including:
	- Logic Time
	- Draw Time
	- FPS
	- Desktop Hz
	- Game Hz
	- Fixed Rate Logic Ticks
	- VWait on/off
	- Slow Motion
	- Memory Allocated
	- Music Volume
	- Sound Volume
- FPS Counter.
- Fast on/off toggle.  Good for testing maximum frame rate.
- Slow Motion mode. Runs at 25% (or user-defined speed), good
  for testing movement and animation.

*Functionality*

- Screenshot with F12.
- Quick Exit key for developers.
- Boss Key automatically minimises and pauses game and music, even
  in full-screen mode.
- Sound on/off hot keys.
- Adjust music volume and sound volume separately.
- Pause Key.  Also pauses and resumes music (if any is playing).
- Protection against two copies of game running at once.

*Other Useful Types*
- TMousePointer handles loading a cursor, getting mouse values
  once per logic loop (to ensure constant coords and button
  readings), supports offsets for where point is not in top left,
  and slides the game cursor smoothly off the edges of the window
  instead of leaving it at the last known position.
- TSprite includes animation capability.
- TButton with mouse-over graphic, sound and management code.
- TGameSound incorporates name, pitch and volume.
- TSoundBank for easy storage and retrieval of sounds.
- TGameImage incorporates name, width and height.
- TImageBank for easy storage and retrieval of images.

*Splash screens*
- Splash screen with fade image and sound in/out functionality.
- Support for a publisher/portal splash screen.

*Loading screen*
- Loading screen with a loading bar supported.
- After Loading is complete, the loading bar is optionally
  replaced with a "Click here to play" button.
