The game is fully playable in all modes, including Leagues, Tournaments, Sharks, CPU Opponents and even Online Play.<br><br>You also no longer have to download a full version when you buy the game. You will be sent a serial key to unlock the game and all future updates, which makes it easier for me, and easier for customers to get updates.<br><br>The only other change to this version is that the slow, irritating menus are now much faster and less irritating. We had a lot of requests for that, so now you have it.<br><br>All registered owners ( of which I know there are at least a few among the Blitz Community ) should have received an email with your serial key. If you do not receive this soon, let me know and I will resend your information.<br><br>NOTE: You do not need to update to this version if you don't wish to. Your pre-registered full version download will not expire and the only change registered owners will notice is the faster menus.<br><br><img src="http://www.glimmergames.com/pool/screen1.jpg"> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

One or two things irritated though. The way the balls never quite ground to a halt is the most obvious one. the cloth would have a bit more friction than that in real life.<br>still finding the aiming really weird in windowed mode. <br><br>It would be better IMHO with a  shot power meter.<br>cueing and aiming are the two most important aspects, so you need to get them spot on <br><br>it seems at the moment you pull the cue back then let go and you get either a very powerful shot or a shot that is too slow. need more control<br>If these things were addressed fixed I would really enjoy playing the game <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I've played many snooker/pool games in the past, and this has probably the most realistic graphics and sounds that I've seen and heard. The clacking of the balls is particularly satisfying.<br><br>Some things I would like to see added in future versions:<br><br>* Better camera options after taking a shot. As far as I can tell, there are two options - auto, which shows you a top down view as soon as you take a shot (quite disorientating), and manual, which just keeps the camera where it is after taking a shot.<br><br>I would like to see an option that tracks the cue ball after you take a shot, like in Jimmy White's.<br><br>* Axis lock. I would like to be able to lock the y axis when taking a shot, so moving the mouse just spins the camera left and right, and not up and down as well.<br><br>* Ability to move the camera further down when taking a shot, so it's like your chin is resting on the cue. At the moment it feels like there is quite a large gap between camera and cue, even when you're as far down as you can be.<br><br>Overall though, I think this is a fine game. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
