Any suggestions are appreciated:)<br><br>Age of Kingdoms is a game of strategy which is easy to learn and fun to play. You are one of the six lords in the land. The dream of you is simple - Take over the entire land. Being a lord, you must hire peasants, swordmen, knights or dragons, build huts, castles or cities to defend your domain, control your armies to conquer other countries on the map. Age of Kingdoms features over 80 different maps, challenging computer opponents, multiplayer mode, network play, a player ranking board, and much much more!<br><br>www.etiumsoft.com/kingdom.htm <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Unfortunately it's also that kind of simple that makes a programmer think - if I really want it i'll write it myself - because at the end of the day it's just a set of board game rules and an AI heuristic.<br><br>Your charging $20 for the game and so it has to be compared to games of that ilk, now quite often when I see shareware games I think to myself "you are charging real money for that?  It's not worth a monopoly note..." and then I dont bat an eyelid as the game fails to attract an audience.<br><br>In this instance I can see there could be some interest in the game, it's quite addictive, it's well polished (although not positively shining), it's got good gameplay and the graphics are not shabby.  As a game it is really quite good - but to me it just wasn't worth $20 - there wasn't enough to it.<br><br>Maybe i'm saying sometimes simple isn't enough, when we all know that the simple ideas are the best, so i'm probably wrong, but it just didn't feel that there was enough depth.<br><br>I hope that helps you evolve the product because i'd like to see it suceeding.

The capitals are very important in slay, but we haven't.    If you play the two game seriously, you may find the differences.

My kingdom closest to the coast becomes my main base.  I build two or three huts like this, working my way either toward securing the coast for my main base or wriggling through other kingdoms in an attempt to join up with the main base.  While I risk having my kingdom split later by having my other kingdoms make a b-line for my coastal kingdom and leaving a long thin stretch of land, I think the early pooling of resources helps my main base get a slight advantage over my immediate neighbours.  I don't bother expending resources defending that strip of land - I expand outward radially from my coastal kingdom.  Usually, one kingdom doesn't make it.<br><br>When I first get soldiers, I try to take out a neighbouring farmer or a hut with each of their moves, crippling my opponents.  I punish stronger neighbours while avoiding stronger far-off kingdoms.  I expand as quickly as possible into nearby weaker kingdoms, securing coastline and gobbling up area, if not hexes - I often leave a patchwork of single and double enemy hexes in my lands and usually don't bother to go back and clean them up (if at all) until they sprout farmers - my farmers are usually too busy helping my soldiers secure new lands to bother with trees or a few rogue farms.<br><br>I constantly expand as quickly as possible, but if I can expand elsewhere I try to keep groups of weaker kingdoms as a buffer between my lands and my stronger opponents'.  I usually use my own units to guard my land, but a few well-placed huts keep my buffer trouble-free of ambitious farmers while my army is busy trying to cripple whichever kingdoms are the most powerful.  I don't take land I don't plan on guarding with at least a hut or a farmer.  If I can use my units to guard land until I take the land beyond it, I've saved money on not bothering to purchase huts on land that wasn't at my front lines for very long anyways.<br><br>I hire soldiers as quickly as possible and enough farmers to assist them in liberating enemy lands - roughly at 1:1.  Most of the time, I defeat enemy soldiers by starvation: I weave a line of farmers and soldiers around the troops and watch them fall dead, then send in farmers to mop up most of the graves and claim the land at my own.  A line of farmer-soldier-farmer-farmer-soldier-farmer is invulnerable to anything less than a general.  Often I need a couple extra soldiers in there to weave through enemy farmers or near enemy huts.<br><br>I won't hire a general until absolutely necessary: often I can just surround a castle, post huts around it and ignore it until I'm mopping up at the end.  If the enemy hires a general, I keep my troops safe by staying away from my borders until I can weave a line around him and kill off the general, then I resume my attacks on his soldiers.<br><br>Recently I've learned to bait my opponents: leaving a break in my guard near the coast, but keeping everything but the beach hexes guarded.  The enemy will press the "advantage" and march single file along the beach, claiming my land with farmers and soldiers, then I weave a noose around their supply lines and they all starve.<br><br>I don't bother with buildings except huts to keep farmers at bay.  I find castles and generals to be too pricey to bother with on the small demo maps. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Look in some of the old discussions for detailed info on this problem. Especially if you don't redraw the initial screen twice, your entire screen will flicker like there is no tomorrow.<br><br>Not sure if this also goes for DirectX mode, but it was *very* noticable on my and many others' systems in OpenGL. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
