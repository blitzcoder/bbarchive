I'm aiming for fun physics and easy controls, but I may have overdone it.<br><br>NOTE : Practice 1 and Practice 2 are DIFFERENT. Practice 1 is the typical control system, with bars. Practice 2 is a new bowling system where you move the mouse to bowl the ball.

It doesn't take long and is worth the effort to set the verts near the pinched ones to about 50-75% blend. It would dramatically improve the appearence.<br><br>Onto practise modes....<br><br>Practise mode 1: is cool, I understand exactly what is going on and it does the job.<br><br>Practise mode 2: don't understand it at all. The instructions flash on the screen for about a second then I'm cluelessly sitting there.<br><br>I liked the camera once, and then it's farting about became very annoying quickly as it's too smooth. After a while you feel a little sick. I would do the centre line they do in films - ie, keep the camera on one side of that imaginary line at all  times, and the character on the other. Use any camera shots you like, but never cross the line. Your camera crosses this line and makes you try to work out where it's going. It's also too smooth.<br><br>Try speeding up some bits and doing a couple of cuts there.<br><br>Above all, I think it's likely to turn out to be the best bowling game around, but it needs careful consideration on a couple of things.

You deal with direction, power and spin all at the same time.<br><br>A further point I think is worth mentioning - the camera transitions are excruciatingly slow.  When a player clicks on the pins, he doesn't want to wait ten seconds before he can do anything else.<br><br>Also, the camera scrolling up to the scoring monitor seems a bit pointless, since its just a static texture on the monitor screen - the ACTUAL scores are just plonked on top as an overlay.<br><br>Lastly, why do you have to click on her arse to 'aim and shoot'?  Sexual innuendo?<br><br>[edit] Oh - almost forgot - on my very first go i knocked down 9 pins.  The tenth remained upstanding (sort of), but it was leaning at an angle around 30-35 degrees. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I don't do any kind of checking yet. If you select shaders on a videocard that doesn't support cubemaps, spheremaps and stuff like that, it will let you.<br><br>2) There are visual cues. There should be a text prompt whenever you move the mouse over a "hotzone". Don't know why you wouldn't get one.. maybe the shaders thing again, but I doubt it.<br><br>3) Yes, her ass is in the way. That's easy enough to take care of.<br><br>4) The general consensus is that the camera moves too slow. That's easy enough to fix. For now, be aware that right clicking will skip any camera pan.<br><br>5) Method 1 and Method 2 are both going to remain, though they're both subject to considerable change. In the proper version ( the one I have that hasn't had a bunch of stuff ripped out like the one you have ) lets you choose the control method per character, so everyone can use the one they prefer. I want one method to provide a very artificial, sequential, step-by-step method. That's method 1. Yes, it's probably a bit too easy ( though I wish I could hit strike after strike like Tracer.. he's better than me at my own damn game :P )  <br><br>I was thinking of making the bars move at different speeds depending on whether you choose easy, medium or hard difficulty level. Would that be a good thing? Then those who don't find it easy can still play easy, and those who do find it too easy can pick another difficulty level.<br><br>Method 2 would be a lot easier if there were instructions. Well there are, but they won't remain on screen if you move the mouse. So don't move the mouse and you'll see what you have to do. Basically you move the mouse forward / side to side to aim the shot, then as soon as the power bar clicks in, move it left to right to apply spin. It might be a little too fast, I don't know, but I wanted something which kinda sorta simulates the way you actually bowl. Sorta like how Virtual Snooker simulates the way you move the snooker cue.<br><br>6) The backboard is very short and pins have a habit of going over the top of it. That's one of those "yeah i know, I haven't done that yet" issues.<br><br>7) The clicking on her ass has been mentioned. I guess I'm just too innocent to have noticed :P I'll take care of it. Well I'll just move her ass out of the way altogether.<br><br>8) Yes, the character rig is an old pre-blended weights rig. I simply haven't had time to update her, but it's on my to-do list.<br><br>9) Yes, I'm focussed on playability.<br><br>10) I may put the score on the monitor at a later date. I still like the camera panning up to the monitor though, even if it's purely aesthetic.<br><br>11) I'm really surprised you caught the pin leaning, because I check the pins by angle, and if they're 30-35 degrees, they're well within the range I pick up as dead pins. I'll look for a bug in that, but I'm very puzzled at the moment. I've played frame after frame after frame and I've never seen that. Odd.<br><br><br>If I've missed any points, I apologise, please remind me. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

When you get a strike you get the score for the next two balls added on not the next two frames (four throws). A spare gives you the score from the next ball. Of course if you get more than one strike in a row you still get two throws before the frst strikes score gets added. Its always two throws (unless you're on frame ten)<br><br>I haven't tred but you get a third ball if you get a spare or a strike on the tenth frame don't you?<br><br>What do I think of the controls?<br><br>I think the first control system is ok but there are too many clicks to get anything to happen. Maybe if you combine the direction with the spin - move the mouse to position click and hold then move to set the spin.<br><br>I quite like the second control system. You should make it more visual though. In virtual pool you got to see the cue moving before you hit the ball. You should be able to see the speed whatsit moving, and the arrow turning until you press the mouse button. Also the control text shouldn't be there when you aim as it is you click and then have to try too aim and set the speed with the text obscuring the screen.<br><br>You should add walls to the sides of the lane where the pins are. In real bowling they are there to stop pins from bouncing across to the next lane. They also make is possible to pick up a 7 10 split - which is where the two corner pins are left standing. You can do this by bouncing one pin off of the wall and getting it to hit jump across to the other side of the lane.<br><br>I agree that the camera moves are too slow, and also think there are too many. Maybe you should add the option to remove them in the options screen. Or... maybe you could add a camera speed option in the options screen (off - slow - medium - fast) with it defaulting on medium (a bit faster than you have now) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
