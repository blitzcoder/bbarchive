I will respond to everyone, but it might take a bit (tending to a sick child this weekend)<br><br>To answer a few questions,... right now the game on the top of my list is my 3d RC racing game,... I'd really like to make it work. I can send anyone what I have if they would like to play with some parts. I'm not looking for an all out physics simulation here,... something fun with the cars sliding around, and driven from an RC point of view. I have a working demo of this I will send out on request.<br><br>Also on my list is the BTB game (BigTop Bob) this game would be a marble madness/super monkey ball style game with a clown on a unicycle. I've got over 750 frames of animation complete and a small amount of code for this one. There are a few pics of BTB on the above graphics page.<br><br>here is a link to another simple game I have started,...the object is to circle the onscreen items without touching them. <br><a href="http://www.redgreenbob.com/proofs/pongo/blitz/orbit.zip" target="_blank">http://www.redgreenbob.com/proofs/pongo/blitz/orbit.zip</a><br>I had a lot of trouble getting the circle detect working, so right now I've stopped work on it.<br><br>Otherwise I'm wide open on the type of game to create,... I love ISO games, and I'd like to create fun games with lots of animation. I prefer smaller games because I want to make sure things will get finished at first,... if I find someone I work well with I would be willing to take on a larger project. I work professionally as a 3D Animator doing mostly TV commercials and a small amount of film work, so this is pretty much a hobby of mine.<br><br>ALG,... love your zombie game,... it's a perfect example of the types of projects I want to be doing. I'll send you a private email later. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Perhaps you would be interested in including TournamentBlitz Service within your games. Its ideal for small games and adds a unique replay incentive. Check out TournamentBlitz Demo <a href="http://www.tournamentblitz.com/newplayer.cfm" target="_blank">here</a>. <br><br>Please be aware that the demo highlights basic Tournament Blitz Operation, not the game (which is Mark Sibly's Insectoids). The Tournament Blitz Service can be applied to any game with a score system. Full Developer SDK and Support coming soon.<br><br>I'm interested in programming all sorts of 3D Arcade-style games. Which usually are simple, easy to play, and fun. I'm open to new ideas and camera perspectives are of no concern (ie 1stPerson, Top-Down, etc). Check out my first Blitz Game <a href="http://techlord.blackeve.com/asteroid/" target="_blank">Asteroid Falling</a>.<br><br>Lets discuss it... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
