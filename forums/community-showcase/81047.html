That comes from trying to do everything oneself. The lack of multiplayer and in-game saves are a definite lack.<br><br>It's interesting the range of opinions TU's received from the reviewers. There's been gushing puff-pieces that even I felt were OTT to one completely dismissive review by a self confessed strategy/rpg/board game afficionado who surprise, surprise, just didn't like the game and wrote it off on that basis (thanks mate).<br><br>Thing is, if you get one really bad/unfair review, it can drop your metacritc score.

I think you should take advantage of the steam update system and change the static to look more pixelated... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The reviewer certainly hurled himself into a self-traumatizing sense of shame with such relentless joy of tearing something up that he obviously can't or wouldn't want to relate to. I wouldn't be too surprised, if it wasn't the first time he went overboard with his selfrighteous desire to represent authority. It may have given him a big kick the first time around, piercing him only mildly with what should've been a trauma of shame, but he might have found justification by a sufficient amount of actual sheep, who were to second his stark opinion.<br><br>In his defence, if there could possibly be such a thing, I would assume that he simply comes from a different realm of games and can't look at this particular one from "our" vantage point. Since I havn't played it myself, but only looked at screenshots and have a decent imagination, I also believe that its visual consistency is awesome and admirable to most of us here. I'm sure, if we were from the UT team or some EA slavelabor camp, we'd have a somewhat different perception as well. <br><br>But, nontheless, he certainly sounds like a fragrant S-hole with perfectly inappropriate insensitivity and runs the risk of being nothing but a little propaganda suck-up...  that's, by the way, yet another possible assumption. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
