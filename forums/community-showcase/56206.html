Not sure now. :)<br><br>I'm not even sure whether the game mechanic works, TBH, mainly because the 360 degree movement has significantly changed the dynamic of the game, compared to the original Snake. It is fun and kind of compelling just guiding the snake around, though.<br><br>This is still at a very early WIP stage, so I guess it's a good time to ask my question:<br><br><b>Develop it or ditch it?</b> :P <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

However, in motion I think they look alot better. It's quite mesmerizing watching the snake's markings moving around. :)<br><br>I actually think I tried the idea of using cylinders instead of spheres. This was easy to try as I already have to rotate each segment according to the way they're 'facing', in order to get the highlight positioned in the correct place. There was alot of extra work and graphics just to get that effect.<br><br>As I remember (been months since I've touched this code), cylinders didn't look as nice to me. I can't really remember - maybe I'll give it another go. There may also be collision detection problems with using cylinders as I can imagine it be possible to turn very close to the wall and have a cylinder segment 'catch' the wall, as it curves around (if you see what I mean).<br><br><div class="quote"> As to whether you should develop it or ditch it?

I mainly had kids and casual gamers in mind. The fact that I overheard two mate's girlfriends talking about their new mobile/cell phones and moaning that they couldn't play Snake anymore, made me think I might be on to a good thing.

I added this because I was thinking about having bombs (like those in Bomberman) being thrown into the arena, instead of fruit. The bombs would have a countdown to exploding, so the snake would have to get to it and eat it, before it goes off. Then, you could speed up to get to the bomb if time is short. :)<br><br>I was also thinking of having a set number of bombs thrown into each level (or, maybe the snake has to reach a certain length) before a wormhole appears to take you to the next level.
