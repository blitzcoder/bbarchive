This has meant that I was in a position to put the trial version of the game together, which is exactly what I have done.<br><br>Rockfall DX is essentially a complete reboot of my Rockfall games, originally started on the Atari ST, and now being released for PC and Mac.  The game is a tribute to the Repton games from the days of the Acorn Electron and BBC Micro, which also bear a resemblance to Boulderdash.<br><br><img src="http://www.sos-software.co.uk/games/standalone/rdx/screens/full/rdx_1.png"><br><br>I thought it would be good if I released the trial versions here, ahead of the public released, for feedback and if anyone experiences any problems (particularly on Lion, as I haven't got it to test it myself just yet).  Download links below.<br><br>Windows installer (XP and later) - <a href="http://www.sos-software.co.uk/games/standalone/rdx/downloads/RDX_Trial_Setup.exe" target="_blank">Download (8MB)</a><br><br>Mac DMG (Universal) - <a href="http://www.sos-software.co.uk/games/standalone/rdx/downloads/rdx_trial.dmg" target="_blank">Download (7.7MB)</a><br><br>(The above are the latest updates, including the bug fix and some of the suggestions made below).<br><br>This trial contains just 12 levels and 1 music track, while the full version will have 80 levels in the default set, plus 6 additional music tracks, and a built-in level editor.<br><br>Do download, give it a whirl, and let me know what you think or if you have any problems.<br><br>Enjoy.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That makes me wonder if that's why you made the game `easier`? In boulderdash etc the gems themselves would probably fall posing an extra challenge. Also there are absolutely no enemies or anything other than navigating, not getting a boulder on your head and collecting gems. At least that's my impression from level 1.<br><br>One thing I am unsure about also is the background, which moves in parallax but is almost the same scroll speed as the foreground. Not sure what you're trying to do there, make a fake 3D depth or what? Maybe it'd work better scrolling faster. Also the `dirt` that you dig through is really hard to distinguish from non-dirt tiles, it's too subtle. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I will add some prompt text so the player knows they need to press something.<br><br><div class="quote"> Also, the menu itself appears rather small on a 1920x1200 resolution display, perhaps scale those kind of things up a bit depending on the resolution the game chooses? <br></div><br>Really?!  How big is your monitor?  Looks just fine on my 1080p 22" monitor.  You are actually playing at the most the game will support natively (anything higher and the game will attempt to find the next nearest with the same aspect ratio).  In terms of scaling generally, the bulk of the code was written years ago when most people were quite content with their CRT monitors and the original intention was have the game default to 1024x768 with the option of going higher.  Things have changed and I've had to change it to suit LCD monitors and their native resolutions.  Adding scaling now would be a bit of a ball-ache now, to be honest.  You live and learn though...<br><br><div class="quote"> As far as actual gameplay is concerned: I played the first two levels, but found it a bit.... boring, to be honest. <br></div><br><div class="quote"> I agree with all of that. And yes, maps too large and not much happening. First few levels should be smaller and draw the player in. <br></div><br>Point taken.  I will shall remove or "jazz-up" those two levels in the demo (and the full game, for that matter).  Things do start to get more interesting from level 3.  Probably introducing things more gradual than I should.<br><br><div class="quote"> Apparently you're targetting kids with this game, by the graphic style? That makes me wonder if that's why you made the game `easier`? <br></div><br>Not at all, I'm aiming for anyone interested in puzzle games.  The reason the graphics look like they do is that I couldn't find a graphics artist who could commit.  I therefore ended up doing the graphics myself, and I'm no graphics artist.<br><br><div class="quote"> In boulderdash etc the gems themselves would probably fall posing an extra challenge. <br></div><br>Boulderdash is a similar game, but the mechanics are different in Repton.  In that game only the boulders fall, and it's not possible to outrun them.  I always thought Repton to be more of a challenge, as being able to outrun falling boulders always seemed a bit of a cheat to me.  Everyone has their taste and it's probably down to which they played first.<br><br><div class="quote"> Also there are absolutely no enemies or anything other than navigating <br></div><br>There are later.<br><br><div class="quote"> One thing I am unsure about also is the background, which moves in parallax but is almost the same scroll speed as the foreground. <br></div><br>I used to have this move at half the speed of the foreground, but it seemed a little fast.  It's currently around 90% as I wanted something a bit more subtle.  I'll speed this up a little, so it's more apparent.<br><br><div class="quote"> Also the `dirt` that you dig through is really hard to distinguish from non-dirt tiles, it's too subtle. <br></div><br>Do you mean against the parallax background?  Would it be better if it were darker, or the backgrounds lighter?  Thinking the former at the moment.<br><br><div class="quote"> it won't play on my Macbook . it starts, it goest through the loading screen then it crashes with a "quit unexpectedly" message. <br></div><br>That's a bit worrying!  Could you provide more info on your set-up.  Going on your sig, is that Snow Leopard installed?  I haven't had the chance to test on Lion yet (I don't have it at the mo), so are you now using that?  Also, the game creates a debug log during the initialisation process.  If the game crashes this file should still be on your hard drive.  It's located in /Library/Application Support/SOS Software/Rockfall DX Trial and is simply called DebugLog.  If this file is present and is not empty, could you post it here.<br><br><br>Thanks for your feedback.  Good job I haven't made this public yet! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So what I have done is built another debug version that will save additional text files in the same location as the normal DebugLog at specific points in the first run through the main loop of the game.  Hopefully, this will give me an idea of where it falls over.<br><br>I haven't done this with the normal DebugLog as unless the file is closed properly it remains empty (I don't have this problem in Windows).  It's a bit messy admittedly, but I couldn't think of another way of identifying when things go wrong.<br><br>Please give this one a try and let me have the contents of the last file it saves (these are all numbered files).  <a href="http://www.sos-software.co.uk/games/standalone/rdx/downloads/RDX_Trial_Mac_Intel_Debug.zip" target="_blank">Download here</a>.<br><br>Your help is very much appreciated.<br><br>Cheers. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

God!!!<br><br>I know what the problem is now.  When the game runs it creates a profile using your account user name and then displays a "welcome" message that includes your name for a few seconds.  This uses a large rock style font that only contains a limited number of characters.  Your user name has a "_" in it, which the font does not - hence the error and it going tits up!<br><br>A really stupid mistake to make, and one I'm normally careful about avoiding.  Guess I had an off-day somewhere along the way.<br><br>I have uploaded a new version that should have hopefully fixed the issue.  This is not a debug version, so hoping I don't need to do some more digging with your help.<br><br>Latest version: &lt;Link dead now&gt;<br><br>Really appreciate your help.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font><br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
