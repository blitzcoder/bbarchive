For some time I have been working on many parts of hardwired and hybrid and I have had to 'dismantle' both in order to do so.  This is why updates have been very infrequent since july.<br><br>I am now beginning to put it all back together with the new code incorporated.  This is the first instance of the new release.  This prerelease contains some code that has not yet been re-activated - this is why it may act exexpectedly compared to the previous release.  And this is also why I recommend you do not decompress this pre-release to the same folder as you do for the previous releases.<br><br>If I am uploading this pre-release it is to see mainly if you have any problems on your system with the new module I am testing, a compatibility test if you like.  Please report on this thread if you have any crash issues on your system.<br><br>The module I am testing is the new HLSL precompiling module.  If all is good, you can now compile HLSL shader code within the blitz code using the IDE.  Please see hlsl_demo.hb and hlsl_demo_with_compile_error.hb for example.  Please also note the the hlsl_demo_with_compile_error.hb sample program is designed NOT to work, but to show that the precompiler detects and signals any errors found in HLSL code. <br><br>The HLSL precompiler compiles any HLSL code integrated into it <u>before</u> the program code is compiled, and the compiled shaders are incorporated into the final compiled .exe code.  In this way, any shader compiling time and error checking will not be necessary during runtime of the program, as it will already be done :D  As you can see, the precompiler considerably changes the look of the IDE.  Hlsl code can now be incorporated into Hybrid's code by using the new <b>Script</b> command.<br><br>This command's syntax is the following....<br><br><b>Script identifier(entry_function$,shader_version$,flags%)</b><br><i><u>Parameters...</i></u><br><i>identifier</i> - a user chosen label used to identify the script.  This unique identifier is used as reference in order to be able to 'recall' the shader's compiled code when in runtime.  If the identifier supplied in the Script command has already been used, the compiler will return an error.<br><br><i>entry_function$</i> - refers to a string designating the name of the function held within the HLSL script that is called when the shader is executed.  This parameter is case-sensitive, and obligatory for the precompiler to work.  Failure to supply this parameter or to supply an inexistant function name will result in a HLSL compiler error.<br><br><i>shader version$</i> - a string containing information of what kind of shader the following code contains and the version number of the HLSL code.  Valid parameters are...<br><br>"vs_1_1" - Reperesents a vertex shader, version number 1.1<br>"vs_2_0" - Reperesents a vertex shader, version number 2.0<br>"vs_2_a" - Reperesents a vertex shader, version number 2.a<br>"vs_3_0" - Reperesents a vertex shader, version number 3.0<br>"ps_1_1" - Reperesents a pixel shader, version number 1.1<br>"ps_1_2" - Reperesents a pixel shader, version number 1.2<br>"ps_1_3" - Reperesents a pixel shader, version number 1.3<br>"ps_1_4" - Reperesents a pixel shader, version number 1.4<br>"ps_2_0" - Reperesents a pixel shader, version number 2.0<br>"ps_2_a" - Reperesents a pixel shader, version number 2.a<br>"ps_2_b" - Reperesents a pixel shader, version number 2.b<br>"ps_3_0" - Reperesents a pixel shader, version number 3.0<br><br>The above version profiles are compatible with both directx9 and direct x 11.  However, the following remaining profiles are ONLY compatible with dx11.<br><br>"cs_4_0" - Reperesents a compute shader, version number 4.0<br>"gs_4_0" - Reperesents a geometry shader, version number 4.0<br>"ps_4_0" - Reperesents a pixel shader, version number 4.0<br>"vs_4_0" - Reperesents a vertex shader, version number 4.0<br>"cs_4_1" - Reperesents a compute shader, version number 4.1<br>"gs_4_1" - Reperesents a geometry shader, version number 4.1<br>"ps_4_1" - Reperesents a pixel shader, version number 4.1<br>"vs_4_1" - Reperesents a vertex shader, version number 4.1<br>"cs_5_0" - Reperesents a compute shader, version number 5.0<br>"ds_5_0" - Reperesents a domain shader, version number 5.0<br>"gs_5_0" - Reperesents a geometry shader, version number 5.0<br>"hs_5_0" - Reperesents a hull shader, version number 5.0<br>"ps_5_0" - Reperesents a pixel shader, version number 5.0<br>"vs_5_0" - Reperesents a vertex shader, version number 5.0<br><br><i>flags</i> - Options to pass to the precompiler.  Presently there are only two flags available...<br><br>1 = Do not compile this script into a directx9 compatible shader<br>2 = Do not compile this script into a directx11 compatible shader<br><br>Lines following the <b>Script</b> declaration will be treated as HLSL code up until an <b>End Script</b> command.  This command will be used signal to the ide and to the compiler that any following code will be treated as normal blitz/hardwired code.<br><br>When you compile a Hybrid program now, if any <b>Script</b> command is found in it, the precompiler will be launched automatically.  A window will appear, giving details of its progress and will close automatically is the precompilation of the shaders is a complete success.  Please note that, unless the flag to not compile is given or if the shader profile is higher that the maximum version permitted for dx9, all shaders will be precompiled for both directx9 and directx11 automatically.  If the HLSL compiler encounters any error in the HLSL code, it will indicate the problem in the precompiler log window and the compiler will not execute the code, returning you to the ide.<br><br>For the moment, I have not yet activated the code that allows you to use the shader code in your Hybrid program (which will become the 'Recall' command).  This will be coming shortly (yes, in September ;D).  The aim of the exercise today is to see if the precompiler works.  So, please check it out if you have time and let me know if there's any problems, or even if it works okay for you.<br><br><a href="http://chipmunkplayer.free.fr/hlsl_prerelease.zip" target="_blank"><img src="http://chipmunkplayer.free.fr/hardwired_button.gif"></a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Once run, the executable 'unarchives' this data when needed by 'splitting up' this data block into the respective shaders.<br><br>I plan to use this same archiving method for storing files.  Keep your eyes peeled for 'IncBin' and 'IncDir' commands that I plan to create.  These commands will allow you to 'include' any file that will become part of the final .exe file.  The idea is to be able to secure data files, by incorporating them all into the executable - if the user wishes to, of course.  Stay tuned for this addition... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You can even mix and match if you're feeling messy; starting with a Script command and ending with a End HLSL is valid for example. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Its revised syntax is the following<br><br><b>Script identifier(entry_function$,shader_type%,flags%)</b><br><br>The identifier,entry_function$ and flags% parameters stay the same as explained in <a href="/post.php?topic=105010&amp;post=1276367" target="_blank">my first post on this thread</a>, however I have replaced the shader_version$ with the shader_type% parameter.  The following values are valid for this parameter....<br><br>1 - Compile as a vertex shader; the vertex shader will be compiled once for directx 9 and for four different possible profiles in directx 11; a total of 5 versions shader code.  The flags parameter of course still applies if you wish to disable compiling for a specific version of directx.<br>2 - Compile as a pixel shader - same as above, but for pixel shaders.<br>3 - Compile as a compute shader (not yet complete)<br>4 - Compile as a vertex shader (not yet complete)<br>5 - Compile as a vertex shader (not yet complete)<br>6 - Compile as a vertex shader (not yet complete)<br><br>So that's it for the Script command. Once a script has been introduced into a hybrid program, the Hybrid compiler will recognise this and begin precompiling, according to the parameters given in the script command.  If errors are found, a report will be made on the precompiler output window; if all is fine after the precompilation the output window will automatically close once done and proceed with the rest of the compilation.<br><br><b><u>Recalling shaders</b></u><br>Once run, a program can 'recall' a precompiled shader by using the identifier of the shader.  There are currently two shader recall commands available...<br><br><b>RecallVertexShader%(shader_name$)<br>RecallPixelShader%(shader_name$)<br></b><br><br>The shader_name parameter refers to the name given as an identifier in the Script command.  If the shader is found, a handle to the shader will be returned by these two commands.  Use RecallVertexShader only for vertex shaders and RecallPixelShader only for pixel shaders - mixing these will result in an error.<br><br><b><u>Shader programming</b></u><br>Two types of inputs exist for shaders...<br><br>For vertex shaders, the first kind of inputs come from the object the shader is rendering; the object will send it the xyz values of each vertex, along with its vertex normal xyz values, vertex colour and eventual texture mapping coordinates.  The vertex shader is called for each vertex and is always called before the pixel shader.  The vertex shader's principal job is to calculate the screen position of the pixel where a vertex lies, once the three points of a triangle from the rendered object's triangle list have been calculated, the renderer will call the pixel shader for every pixel between these three points.  However, you can program a vertex shader to do much more than that if you so wish, such as lighting or instancing calcuations.<br><br>So, for every time that the vertex shader is called, these input values change, depending on the object being rendered.  However, during the render cycle of an object, the second type of inputs can be used as global variables.  These variables are actually called 'constants', as they do not change not matter how many times the shader is called for the object being rendered.  For a vertex shader, three constants that are typically present are the world, view and projection matrices.  These matrices hold the information needed for position, rotation and scalar values combined of the object in question, the camera viewing it, and the render viewport.  Combining these matrices along with the current vertex position within the vertex shader in a matrix multiplication calculation will result in the pixel coordinates.<br><br>Both vertex and pixel shaders are very configurable, but it is very important to remember thier role.  Vertex shaders work in turn on each vertex of a mesh, pixel shaders work on each pixel of a triangle calulated by the vertex shader for each triangle of the mesh's triangle list (if that makes sense ;D).  So, it is important that the vertex shader output has EXACTLY the same form and order as the pixel shader input.<br><br>Apart from the input passed on from the vertex shaders, pixel shaders also have constants.  For pixel shaders, typical constants are material information (ambient,diffuse &amp; specualar colour) and lighting for any lights present in the rendered scene, however the constants can repesent whatever the user wishes depending on what he/she wishes to calculate within the pixel shader.  The output and the final goal of the pixel shader is ALWAYS a colour and alpha value of the pixel; this being a four floating point value array in the order of RGBA, values range from 0 to 1.<br><br>So, you can see that to really bring a shader to life, you need to use constants at some point.  In Hybrid, you can configure shader constants by using the <b>AddShaderConstant</b> and the <b>ValidateConstants</b> commands.  These commands should be used before rendering with the said shader in order to get correct results.<br><br>The purpose of the <b>AddShaderConstant</b> is to notify Hardwired of the detail of the constants for a shader.  The command is used to pass info about each constant individually, and in the same order as in the original shader script.  Once the complete list of the constants has been made with this command use the <b>ValidateConstants</b> to inform Hardwired you have finished configuring the shader.  The shader will then be ready for use. Please note that some shaders do not necessarily need to use constants, the necessity is at the descretion of the person programming it.  See, for example, my sample hlsl_demo.hb.  You will notice that only the vertex shader has has constants defined for it.  This is because for the pixel shader I programmed there was no need for a constant.<br><br>The syntax of the AddShaderConstant command is the following<br><br><b>AddShaderConstant(shader%,constant$,type%,flags%,linked_object%,pad_it%,slot%)</b><br><br><i><u>Parameter details</i></u><br><i>shader</i> - Refers to the shader handle returned by a recall function<br><br><i>constant</i> - The name of the shader constant (given in the shader script), this is case sensitive; watch your typing.<br><br><i>type</i> - The type of constant, this value indicates to hardwired the nature and size of the constant being defined , the following descibes each value...<br><br><u>Manually programmed constants</u><br>	1 - A four-byte floating point value<br>	2 - Two four-byte floating point values<br>	3 - Three four-byte floating point values<br>	4 - Four four-byte floating point values<br>	5= - A four-byte unsigned integer value<br>	6 - Two four-byte unsigned integer values<br>	7 - Three four-byte unsigned integer values<br>	8 - Four four-byte unsigned integer values<br>	9 - A four-byte signed integer value<br>	10, - Two four-byte signed integer values<br>	11, - Three four-byte signed integer values<br>	12, - Four four-byte signed integer values<br>	13, - A four-byte boolean value<br><u>Automatically programmed constants</u><br>	14, - A programmable matrix value (16 floating point values(4 bytes)=64 bytes in size)<br>	15, - The world matrix value (16 floating point values(4 bytes)=64 bytes in size)<br>	16, - The projection matrix value (16 floating point values(4 bytes)=64 bytes in size)<br>	17, - The view matrix value (16 floating point values(4 bytes)=64 bytes in size)<br>	18, - The world projection matrix value (16 floating point values(4 bytes)=64 bytes in size)<br>	19 - The world view matrix value (16 floating point values(4 bytes)=64 bytes in size)<br>	20 - The view projection matrix value (16 floating point values(4 bytes)=64 bytes in size)<br>	21 - The world view projection value (16 floating point values(4 bytes)=64 bytes in size)<br>	22 - A texture matrix value (16 floating point values(4 bytes)=64 bytes in size)<br>	23 - A light matrix value (16 floating point values(4 bytes)=64 bytes in size) - Represents the closest light to the object defined in the linked object parameter<br>	24 - A light matrix value (16 floating point values(4 bytes)=64 bytes in size) - Represents the second closest light to the object defined in the linked object parameter<br>	25 - A light matrix value (16 floating point values(4 bytes)=64 bytes in size) - Represents the third closest light to the object defined in the linked object parameter<br>	26 - A light matrix value (16 floating point values(4 bytes)=64 bytes in size) - Represents the fourth closest light to the object defined in the linked object parameter<br>	27 - A light matrix value (16 floating point values(4 bytes)=64 bytes in size) - Represents the fifth closest light to the object defined in the linked object parameter<br>	28 - A light matrix value (16 floating point values(4 bytes)=64 bytes in size) - Represents the sixth closest light to the object defined in the linked object parameter<br>	29 - A light matrix value (16 floating point values(4 bytes)=64 bytes in size) - Represents the seventh closest light to the object defined in the linked object parameter<br>	30 - A light matrix value (16 floating point values(4 bytes)=64 bytes in size) - Represents the eighth closest light to the object defined in the linked object parameter<br><br>If a constant is defined as an automatically programmed constant, Hybrid will automatically take care of updating the constant when needed.  For example, if you set a constant to a type n°15 (the world matrix), Hardwired will automatically set the relevant constant to the rendered entity's position, rotation and scalar values.<br><br><i>flags</i><br>The flag parameter is used to signal hardwired to further 'treat' the value before setting the constant.  The following values are valid for the flag parameter<br>	0 - Value will not be treated in any way and will be preserved as-is<br>	1 - Transpose a matrix, if constant is not a matrix nothing will be done<br>	2 - Invert a matrix, if constant is not a matrix nothing will be done<br>	4 - Normalize a vector, if constant is not a vector nothing will be done<br><br>Flags 1 and 2 can be or'ed is needed to transpose AND invert a matrix.<br><br><i>linked_object%</i><br>Used to tell hardwired which object is used as reference for the constant.  For example if you use the type 14 (programmable matrix) and set the linked object to the handle of an entity (not necessarily the entity the shader is linked to), Hardwired will automatically set the constant to that entity's matrix (containing of course the position, rotation and scalar for that entity).<br><br><i>pad_it</i> - Set to true of false.  Shader programming has certain rules you have to adhere to, in order to able to correctly program a gfx adapter.  One of these is to remmber that shaders use 'registers' to hold all varibles.  Registers are sixteen bytes in length each, so if for example a float (that only takes up four bytes) is used, the remaining twelve bytes can be left 'unused' by the shader if 'shader packing' is not used.  Setting this parameter to true will indicate that the constant should be 'padded out' so that if the constant lies below the 16-byte count any remainder will be taken into account so that all constants recorded in hardwired remain perfectly aligned with the shader. Set to false if your shader uses some form of constant packing.<br><br><i>slot</i> - Registers can be grouped into 'slots' for faster access.  Grouping constants into slots can improve performance, as when you update a constant, all other constants that belong to the same slot will be updated at the same time.  An example, here is part of one of my pixel shaders...<br><br><pre class=code>

Continuing from the previous explaination of constants programming....<br><br><u>Manually programming constants</u><br>If, when declaring your constants with the <b>AddShaderConstant</b> command, you choose a constant type with a manual update behaviour (see type list in the post #11 of this thread) hardwired will not manage the values automatically.  It will be up to the user to update the values to manner he/she see fit in order to configure certain parameters that may be necessary for a shader to operate.<br><br>The <b>AddShaderConstant</b> command is actually a function - ie. it returns a value.  For automatically updated constant types, the value returned by this function was not really needed once set up, since Hardwired takes care of the rest.  However, for manually updated constants, the value returned is a unique identifier to a constant's handle.  The handle needs to be held in a variable for later use in the initialisation of a shader or in the render loop of a program.  I have now updated hlsl_demo.hb to show a working example of both automatically and manually updated constants.  You will remark that the constants "worldMatrix", "viewMatrix" and "projectionMatrix" remain automatic.  However, I have included two new constants, one for the vertex shader, and one for the first pixel shader - these two constants are named "add_y" and "color".<br><br><textarea class=codebox name="code" wrap=OFF readonly="true" rows="15" cols="80">

</textarea><br><br>You will notice that the result for declaration for these two constants is saved in two variables, addy and colo.  Please note also that for the declaration of the add_y constant that I set the pad_it parameter to true (the default is false).  The reason for this is that the constant here being declared is a four-byte floating point value.  However, do not forget that due to the way a gfx adapter works, it only deal with 16-bit registers.  In order that the 4-byte constant complies with the 16-byte rule, setting the pad_it parameter will inform hardwired to make up for the other unused 12 bytes of the register.  Failure to do so will result in a non-aligned constant buffer and will result in the program crahsing.

However, I do not think that shaders directly treat a screen, so to speak.  Vertex shaders, as the name suggests are strictly for vertices and pixel shaders are used for treating the pixels coming from the output of vertex shaders; so these two types of shaders are dependant on meshes/triangles.  <br><br>There are other kinds of shaders; compute, geometry, hull and domain.  I do plan to integrate full management of these kind of shaders as well - please note that these shader types are for dx11 and beyond, they are not compatible with dx9.  They deal with tesselation techniques and displacement mapping, amongst other things.  Again, mainly reliant on meshes.<br><br>I think what you are referring to 'post process filters' are quite possibly done using a simple shader trick.  The idea I am supposing is that the whole 3d scene in it's entireity is rendered to a texture, and not directly to the screen backbuffer.  This texture is then linked to a simple two-traingle entity with the same dimensions of the output screen/viewport.  This entity is then rendered.  If a custom shader is used with this method, you can apply all sorts of things to the whole image (blur, emboss, brighten, fade, anything...)<br><br>Another 3d technique that is often used is of course a stencil.  I have not yet implemented stencils into Hardwired, but I do plan on doing so.  Multisampling techiniques and multipass shader techniques will also follow.<br><br>@Flanker - I received a message from paypal earlier on your behalf.

Instead of having to declare each element of the constant in question, this command will declare the constant by the number of elements provided in the parameter size.  The returned value is the handle for the whole array.  Elements of the array can be retrieved by the function below.<br><br>A typical array in either c++ or HLSL has the variable identifier directly followed by the array size, surrounded by square brackets....<br><br>float colour[5]; --- this would initialize an array of 5 floating point values, for example, much like a blitz equivalent Dim colour(5).<br><br><b>FindConstantElement%(array%,element_number%)</b><br><br>This function will return the handle of an individual element found in a constant array.  The array parameter is the array handle, returned from a <b>AddShaderConstantArray</b> function.  The element number parameter has to be in the range of 1 up to and including the size of the array.  The command <b>FindConstantElement</b> can be used at any moment for any amount of times as long as the shader exists; whether it is during initialization of your program or inside a main loop.<br><br><u><b>Including binary files into your executbles</b></u><br><br><b>INCBIN filename$</b> - With this new linker directive, you can indicate your intention to bundle files into your compiled executable.  If the given file exists the linker will automatically include the file when compiling.<br><br><b>RecallFile%(filename$)</b> - This command will recall a file previously included by the <b>INCBIN</b> command.  If the filename provided (not case-sensitive) does not exist within the resident archive, the returned value will be 0.  The filename must be exactly the same path provided in the <b>INCBIN</b> command or else it will not be found.   If the file is found a blitz bank will be returned, containing the file in question.   Please see hlsl_demo2.hb for an example, here you will see that the stone texture is 'saved' with <b>INCBIN</b> and recalled during runtime using <b>RecallFile</b>.  The texture is then 'loaded' as a texture using the <b>LoadTextureFromBank</b>.  Try compiling this file to an executable instead of compiling directly.  Run the exe file, you should have the same result and will no longer need the texture file - this compiled executable should be totally independant of the texture file in question and can be run in any folder without any additional files.<br><br><u><b>PLEASE NOTE</b></u>:  <br><br>* Although the bank returned by RecallFile is 100% compatible with <b>LoadTextureFromBank</b>, it isn't quite yet compatible with other bank commands.  I'm still working on that but I'll solve this little problem for 100% compatibility with bank related functions...<br><br>* I am aware that some of the samples render lighting a bit strangely, (such as the maze sample).  This is not a bug, I am currently redesigning the in-built shader that renders for dx11 and, when in HWShader mode, for dx9.  The vertex and pixel shader I am in the process of creating is designed to 'emulate' the directx9 fixed-function pipeline.  This is very complex, so it takes time, but I'm getting there....<br><br><br><br><a href="http://chipmunkplayer.free.fr/hlsl_prerelease.zip" target="_blank"><img src="http://chipmunkplayer.free.fr/hardwired_button.gif"></a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Yes, I have thought about both encryption and compression.  I haven't done so yet, but it does seem like the next logical step for my program.  I'm glad you're reconsidering learning hlsl.

I have almost finished this part, I have a few tweaks left to make on specular lighting and then it will have exactly the same functionality as the original directx9 fixed function pipeline and give the same result which is of course what I am aiming for.  I will of course be expanding upon all of these these functionalites afterwards so as to include some in-built shader effects into hardwired.

All dll's are compatible as far as calling them is concerned.  However it will depend on what the functions in those dll's do.  For example, if it is a sound library, it will have no conflict whatsoever with directx, or with hardwired.  However, if we are talking about a wrapper that manipulates a 3d entity or mesh that worked with Blitz3d for example, the chances are that it will not work.  This is because the structure of a mesh manipulated by hardwired is not the same as a classic mesh structure used in B3D.  Physics engines may possibly work, if again they do not directly manipulate entities or meshes.  Texture manipulations will have to respect the same principles. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This configuration <u>does not</u> affect the system keyboard layout and is strictly local to the executed program.<br><br><a href="http://chipmunkplayer.free.fr/release.zip" target="_blank"><img src="http://chipmunkplayer.free.fr/hardwired_button.gif"></a><a href="http://chipmunkplayer.free.fr/libvlc.zip" target="_blank"><img src="http://chipmunkplayer.free.fr/vlc_button.gif"></a><br><br><a href="http://chipmunkplayer.free.fr/hardwired_help.zip" target="_blank"><img src="http://chipmunkplayer.free.fr/download_b3d_help.gif"></a><a href="http://chipmunkplayer.free.fr/hardwired_blitzplus_help.zip" target="_blank"><img src="http://chipmunkplayer.free.fr/download_bplus_help.gif"></a><br><a href="http://chipmunkplayer.free.fr/help/index.htm" target="_blank"><img src="http://chipmunkplayer.free.fr/ol_b3d_help.gif"></a><a href="http://chipmunkplayer.free.fr/help_blitzplus/index.htm" target="_blank"><img src="http://chipmunkplayer.free.fr/ol_bplus_help.gif"></a>  <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&amp;business=phoebe8%40free%2efr&amp;lc=GB&amp;item_name=Blitz%20Hardwired&amp;currency_code=EUR&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_SM%2egif%3aNonHosted" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_GB/i/btn/btn_donate_SM.gif"></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlitzHardwired" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.blitzbasic.com/img/facebook_24px.png"></a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It always has been a good thing for me to pick things up from time to time and move onto other things when I get stuck, it helps unblock things and gives me time to mull problems over.<br><br>The 64-bit version of Hybrid/Hardwired has been one of the hardest parts for me.  Of course it is not entirely necessary to produce a 64-bit version, you can still do a LOT of things with the 32-bit version; but I really feel that it is due time to have a 64-bit version to bring things in line with modern systems.  With 64-bit you can of course acceess the whole of the system memory, giving more power and potential.<br><br>So anyway, since I started picking up this module again several days ago after my recent breath of inspiration I have made a good lot of progress.  I have learnt quite a lot on the x64 processor architecture and its instructions, calling conventions and opcodes.  It's all fascinating and difficult stuff (really going down to the core machine code here, guys), but I am now getting somewhere.  So, I'm presently in the midst of converting the Hybrid compiler so it compiles for 64-bit as well as 32-bit.   So the new registers and thier sizes have to be taken into account, I'm having fun with this.  I have updated the instruction database to include the x64 definitions and some parts are now coding correctly, things have never looked so promising!  I am dumping a lot of my compiler results instruction-by-instruction and comparing them to precompiled x64 code written by a assembler.  If there's any differences, I work on them and little by little I'm ironing out the bugs.  Hardwired, has already been written and converted to the 64-bit version, so that's ready to be used - all that's left is the compiler side of things, and of course, I have to get this 100% right.<br><br>It's all looking really good, and from my point of view I have made a big leap forward in getting the x64 part completed. I have nothing yet to release, but I thought I'd share this info you just to let you know how things are going in general.  <u><b>If</b></u> I'm lucky, I may be able to release the x64 version next week - once that's done that will be a great hurdle overcome.<br><br>Since I began on my initial whim of a project two years ago, I never ever expected to come this far.  Two years have since passed, and although there are many strings to tie up, I feel that hardwired has come very far since its beginnings.  If hardwired carrys on going the way it is going, I could end up in anthother two years as a very good contender to some of the compilers already available.  Would be great to see hardwired used in other people's projects.  This of course would justify hardwired's existence and all my work.  I just hope I get that far.... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It seems I have much further than I would ever have anticipated, so that's all good stuff.  I have never studied programming in depth at school/college, so I never exactly learnt a tried-and-tested approach at programming; I am sure that there are better and more structured methods than the one I use of course but I go with what I know.<br><br>Anyway, my method is not exactly I-do-what-I-feel-like, but it is not far off.  I do try to bring different modules together bit-by-bit, but sometimes I do get stuck with one, so I'll just leave it after a while trying and I'll come back to it at a later time.<br><br>I'm still of course working on the 64-bit version at the moment, but I am making some good progress.  I am now able to correctly compile an empty project.  This sounds like no progress at all, but there are plenty of initialisation code before the main program and cleanup code after it.  This is working fine now, so this really is good progress, meaning that I have basically cracked labelling, calling and relocation code; and this all in ASM code.

However, the architecture of graphics adapters (even the most modern ones to my knowledge) compute with registers of up to 32-bits in size.  This is the case for both matrices and for vertex descriptions, which is of course processed by the shaders.  In order to make use of 64-bit variables you would have to convert them to 32-bit after any value change; resulting in a loss of precision in the process.  That's just the way it is with the graphics adapter architecture.  I would like to be able to program shaders in 64-bit precision too, but for the moment the manufacturers do not see the need, I guess.<br><br>The 64-bit version of Hybrid I am currently working on is aimed at 64-bit memory access, which is another issue.  However, in 32-bit or 64-bit mode you will only ever have a real 32-bit precision mesh; or at least with the current technologies available this is the case.<br><br>Flanker, I love the shader - great to see, and I might inspire myself with this shader, since I still wish to integrate a texture splatting routine into terrains.  Thanks for that, I am personally very interested to see any shader work in Hybrid; which is great for compatibility tests.  Keep 'em coming... :D <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But even if it is possible to access a dll using html5 script the final page will only be exploitable using a direcx ready windows system.  You are most likely in for some serious compatibility issues here my friend.  Besides, to view a page that 'relied' on the hardwired dll as a dependancy would also require it to be downloaded first before your page would be visible to the end-user, similar to swf files and thier need for adobe flashplayer.  As Rick was saying, it is more likely that Monkey uses OpenGL for compatibility purposes, all web-based systems use opengl, so it is easily adaptable for a webpage.  Directx is however not adopted by all systems.  Hardwired does not use opengl (although I have looked into it, this will not be for a while yet). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Weird.<br><br><br>Funny thing is, I can now compile/run hb code and still have the choice between DX9 &amp; DX11 and actually see a difference, so my guess is that Hybrid.exe still relies on DX9 to be pressent somehow, somewhere even if not used and only DX11 is installed? This is not desirable if you ask me, for MS made it pretty hard to install DX9 and I suspect that at some point will completely pull the plug. Also in future if Hybrid users wish to use only DX11 or DX12 then they would still need to install DX9, which perhaps doesn't make a whole lot of sense to them. This might be worth investigating before moving on, for it's the base to build upon.<br><br>BTW: 32bit all works fine. For 64bit I haven't been able to compile yet, but as you said it's in progress. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

For the moment, I am having a little difficulty in getting both windows working on the same pc.  Although I have two different partitions, only one seems to boot for the moment.  Somthing to do with the ms bootloader boll*cks without a doubt.  I am going to have to dig a bit but I will find out how to do it, for I have read it is possible to do so.  I have just got myself a 240GB ssd, and have split it into two equal partitions - one for Win8.1 (the factory installed os), and the other for Win10.  But it's not easy getting this set-up working, so I'll have to battle a while.  But in any case, that's another story.<br><br>Anyway, once I got win10 installed (which is presently the only OS that works on my pc), the first thing I tried was to see if Hybrid works or not.  I tested it with a few samples, and all works fine, in both DirectX9 and DirectX11 mode.  I think I will have to look a little deeper into this to solve your compatibility problem.  I'll get back to you on this one, but perhaps not in the next few days, as I have a lot of work (my actual job, not Hardwired) at the moment.  But I will sort it out, or give it a damn good try ;-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

However, GuyFawkes I see in your code that you are using a userlib to access the windows api.  This is all well and good, but by using these api routines you cannot expect to have the same results as with b3d.  The internal construction of Hardwired is different, structures are arranged differently or extended and labels are not necessarily the same, and using functions such as FindWindow will return in different results.

I have made a few major changes to hardwired and some new additions since my last release.<br><br>At the moment, I am re-working the skinning routines.  I had a go at this about two years ago and didn't quite get it working - quite frustrating for me as skinned meshes are of course a standard part of any modern 3d engine.  I have now stopped relying on the d3dx animation controller and the d3dx skin container.  Now skinning and animations are handled by my own code.  D3DX routines are part of the directx package but do not reside in the directx dll's, they reside in their own dll's.  All d3dx routines (written by the directx team) are 'helper functions', and are there to facilitate directx programming but are optional.  This is why they are not included in the main directx dll; another one of the reasons is to save memory keeping the d3dx function separate.<br><br>Anyway, I seem at the moment to be on a roll with my new skin/bone and animation routines.  I have completed and testing my animation routines, comprising of complete control over separate animation sets for each mesh surface.  These animation sets comprise in their turn complete management over sequences, nodes and keys.<br><br>For bone control I have created a system of being able to freely and easily control each bone, and linking them in when needed to the animation controller.  The bone heirarchy system then calcautes the needed updated matrices and passes them on to the vertex shader.  I'm not quite there yet, but I'm on the way to finishing this part.  I'm quite confident about getting this done now.<br><br>I have recently also been re-working shadows.  A while ago, I tried this out on hardwired.  Although being partially successful, it wasn't great.  I used a well documented old method of using a elongated copy of entities involved with shadowing and projecting them onto a stencil, and then rendering the the scene using the rendered stencil to mask in the shadows.  This method, although usable, is very reliant on the cpu and so slow's down resources.  The new method I am now using is much more shader reliant and does not use copies of meshes but rather pre-renders the z-buffer info of the scene onto a pre-defined texture, using the each light as a camera. These rendered textures (the number of textures are dependant on the number of lights in the scene of course) are then used by the shaders are used to provide instant info for shadowing techniques.  This is a modern method of shadowning, and much much faster than the older method.  There is of course a greater amount of memory used by texture consumption, but I have devised a way of being able to configure the texture size for shadow projections, with texture size directly affecting shadow quality naturally.  My shadow routines are almost complete - 95% is done on the c++ coding side, but I'm now tring to perfect the shader calcuations.<br><br>Probably the biggest change I have recently made to hardwired is the decision to completely remove any fixed function pipline usage.  I had before included this usage into hardwired - the ffp was even the default render for hardwired.  I have however removed it because I found it unecessary in the end; it was complicating and slowing down my code, and at the end of the day there is nothing the shaders cannot perform in its place.  Shaders are even much more powerful and flexible.  So now everything flows through my own default shaders, so far it's going very well I am happy to say.  Consequently the "UseHWShaders" command has now been removed, as shaders will now always be used - either the defuault hardwired shaders or the user-defined shaders.<br><br>I have also recently discoved that the D3DX dll's have even been depreciated by Microsoft and no longer supported.  Although these libraries are still valid, they are no longer for example issued by default in windows.  This is why for those using hardwired, you have to redownload directx from the net in order to make it work.  The d3dx routines are part of the directx package, but not in the windows factory release.  Hardwired uses the D3DX side of directx for certain things, not many things but some.  This includes matrix and geometrical math functions, and loading of x meshes.  In any case I will be working on replacing these functions with my own versions of them, in order to render hardwired even more compatible with modern systems and eliminate any dependancy of the d3dx api.<br><br>I may well coincidentally be able to release a new version within the coming week, I hope so.  It seems definately faster, smoother, and I have made improvements on the lighting techniques too.  The shaders are getting rather big now in code size!!  I have also begun work on deferred lighting, not ready to release anything in the close future on that side.  So as you can see, I'm working on quite a few things at the same time.  It may seem like a messy way of programming but for me is sometimes essential, as one thing can lead to another and I may sometimes have to modify one module to make room for a modification to another.  A real jigsaw but I guess I'm having fun with it on some masochistic level.<br><br>Anyway, I'll let you know when I can. ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I've always loved Blitz3D as a language, and its lack of support made me sad.<br><br>I had some requests for things I've wished I had in Blitz3D over the years. I don't know if they're even possible or feasible to implement, but I'll throw them out there in case you're interested, along with some examples of why they might be useful:<br><br>1. Store label pointers to and recall label pointers from type fields. When I have a lot of different objects that behave differently it slows things down a little to have that massive Select statement. It would be much faster if instead I could just goto a pointer to an object's AI programming, without needing any if or select statements.<br><br>2. Store type pointers in multidimensional arrays. Sometimes I need a multidimensional web of type objects. An example of this is for a scrolling map, where a web of interlinked types can make for very fast scrolling without any if statements, just direct pointers to what is needed. However, the problem with this approach is that I can't put in a specific coordinate if I want to jump to a specific spot in the web, like I could do using an array. Instead I would have to have it step over one link at a time until it's reached the desired coordinates.<br><br>Thanks for the consideration, and keep up the great work! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
