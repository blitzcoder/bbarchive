I think the green I put there goes nicely with the brown and gold.<br><br>"I wanted the tiles/imagery to pop out, that has been a aestetic battle since the beginning."<br><br>Well they still pop out in my version.  Maybe your monitor is miscalibrated, or you have an LCD screen.  I've carefully calibrated my crt, and am in a dark room and can hardly see any details in the background as you have it.  It is almost black, with a few reddish details.<br><br>Also, you should consider eye strain.  I think your version has too much contrast and it is hard to look at the Sudoku board for any length of time.  My version is easier on the eyes. It could be better though, if you reduced the darkness of the shadow around the numbers, and maybe reduced the saturation of the numbers on the orange tiles so they aren't exactly the same color as the tile behind them.<br><br>I think eye strain is something that is something to be very concerned about in a game like this where you will be staring at it for long periods of time.  Bright flashy colors are nice, but you can do those with effects.  Like that glowing brick you could add some particles that float upwards like embers from a fire, but not floating side to side, just going straight up.  Would look cool.  And you might put some jewels in the snakes eyes that light up on occasion.  And you could make the word Sudoku show a randome sparkle now and then to make it look shiny. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The teal does seem more visually appealing as well. The vines were introduced to break up the initial 'browns', but that really wasn't enough. <br><br>The Sudoku letters currently get brighter and dull at different moments using your animate.alpha function. I have duplicated the letters over my background letters and set them to lightblend with an alpha animation that is offset for each letter.<br><br>Good call on the snake eyes :) I've been saving that implementation until the end. I'm also going to add 'gold dust' from the gold bar when your score is increasing. As it stands now, the center mayan head begins 'sniffing' when you get points. The idea is that the mayan head is 'smelling gold' as your increasing your score.<br><br>The outer head 'blows' the hint tile to the proper location on screen. Whenever a tile is right clicked, it vanishes in an elegant way.<br><br>I might add some additional sparkling to the Sudoku title... maybe even having some of the 'gold dust' fall from it.

You mean you intend to have several game having their high score in the same database on gellyware.com? Then in that case, you could have 100 games sharing the same database, you just have to create ONE sql table per game, and this is it. So you will have the table "table_sudokuMaya" only accessed by your game, "table_doom6" only accessed by the doom6 game, etc.<br>But I guess you don't want to change now ;-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So it's best to just do away with the online scores altogether for my purposes and just store them locally.<br><br><br>@grey - Again, good eye.
