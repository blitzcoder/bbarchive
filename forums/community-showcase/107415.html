So on a monitor, iPad, iphone (i checked) the dice in the above image are square and the rooms above are vertical rectangles - not square.<br><br>Now NOTE. I said monitor, not TV (tv's are different beasts entirely). So... the first thing, would really be to ditch the TV and get a proper lcd monitor. Because without working on a proper device, you will get weird sizes. Particularly from a mc as it will correct it's output to exactly match square pixel where possible - that is the way it was designed to show them! The same goes for windows, and ios: pixel is square.<br><br>In essence what you see should be exactly what you get - the reason for this is print media (books magazines, etc) They MUST be 1:1 so the screen shows exactly what it would look like in print.<br><br>I worked in the print industry with a windows system and crt monitor that needed to have the display physically stretched to match the correct output.<br><br>So, pixel = square. if you have a 200x200 red square on your screen, and it looks like a vertical or horizontal box, then your screen needs to be adjusted until the box looks square. NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND<br><br>250x200 red box looks square on my screen - IT ISN'T - your screen need to be adjusted<br>200x200 red box should NEVER be anything but square <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There is one VERY BIG CHANGE. can you see it?<br>The main character is begging to move (cursor keys maybe?). This would completely change everything as you would need to write a framework to do this. but you can possibly see what I mean about concepts and games?<br><br>I am not saying one method is better than the other, or saying your graphics aren't good.
