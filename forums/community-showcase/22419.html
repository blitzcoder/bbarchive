Here's the scenario I offer. 2004: Religous unrest in Iraq causes USA to back out. Just like it happened before in Iran, the people of Iraq, a majority of which are shia moslems, create a theocratic state. 2008: 4 years later the people of Iraq, again powerful thanks to millions of Euros worth of oil deals to Russia and France, decide that the time is right for a pre-emptive strike against an America crippled by an incompetent administration, to secure the security and freedom of Iraqi citizens from a superpower on the verge of bankruptcy that once again think that Iraqi oil deals will make a difference. Roll on the game.<br><div class="quote"> OT: it's amazing, most people think that taking President Slobodan Milosevic out was a great idea because of the genocyde that was happening.

People really died in these wars for God's sake, it's not something to take lightly. It would be interesting to hear from anyone German what they think of games based around WWII, I personally find them uncomfortable at best. I suppose what I'm saying is, does the game lose anything from being set in a fictitious conflict, maybe loosly based on reality?

Basically I don't have morality. This is what GFK is referring to when saying I started a thread on it being OK to kill people. What I was trying to explain there was in fact that there is no "universal wrong" - that 'Wrong' is not a universal constant but that morality is merely a tool for teaching the stupid to behave sensibly. What I have is commonly called enlightened self-interest and works out to much the same thing (no killing, no stealing, because it is bad for society as a whole, which is bad for the individual). So, children. They are indeed more influenced by what they see, which is why parents should be teaching them to be suitably cynical and sensible.
