If you mean the latter as well, having the user to pay a price which is even higher than the current one could put off many potential buyers which aren't professional game developers.<br><br>A great aspect of multiplatform languages is the ability to compile the game/utility on whatever platform you like to in a matter of a few hours, so that even individuals can manage to have conversion of their products for other platforms, while in the past it was possible only with large-scale projects. In that respect open source products are nearly always free and usually offer a compiled version for a great deal of platforms, so that it clearly demonstrate how 'non-commercial' users are interested in this aspect as well. After all, if you're looking for glory rather than money you want to make your game available for as many users as possible. :)<br><br>Right now, the only thing which is holding me from buying the library is the windows-only compatibility issue (and the lack of bitmap fonts support)... considered that BlitzMax supports MacOs and Linux, the lack of platform support should be considered a minus, since by default BlitzMax should be a multiplatform solution. So, in my humble opinion the ability to compile both on windows, mac and linux shouldn't be an extra, but a future issue to cover. Please consider that is not so easy to tweak a complex library which you didn't write by hand in order to implement MacOs and Linux compatibility, so that by choosing your framework the user becomes tied to your decisions in that respect (i.e. if you decide to keep windows only compatibility, the user will need either to rewrite the incompatible components from scratch or choose another system altogheter).<br><br>To sum it up, I considered £25.90 enough, though I'm still interested in it (it surely saves hours of work, if you have just jumped from other Blitz products to BlitzMax).... However don't get too greedy, or you could lose customers! :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you make a game and sell it as shareware (via the Internet) or retail (in shops), that is basically commercial use.  Shareware games can make big bucks don't forget.  I appreciate that some people make games as a hobby and then release them as shareware but many people are running a business and buy in lots of different tools and the framework should just be viewed as another tool to save time and money.<br><br>As I've said before I'll add full Mac support in the future.  I simply don't have a Mac so it's impossible for me to add Mac support right now.  Also, it should compile on a Mac as I've used the ?Win32 compiler directives where needed, it's just that a few features (not many) won't be present, but everything else, all the types, the game structure, screens etc. will be there.<br><br>I'll probably add bitmap fonts at some point in the future, it's on my to do list, I just don't need them right now.  Remember my main aim with the framework was to make something I could use for my games and a positive side-effect is that it's comprehensive enough to sell and people seem to really like it.<br><br>Yes I'm aware that getting too "greedy" will loose customers, and I don't plan to put the price up any more now.  However, there is a business strategy where the price is high so you sell less and don't have to give as much support, but you get more money per sale.  Finding the balance is important and difficult.  The thing is that everyone that's used it says it's really good value for what you get.  I boosted the price a tiny bit recently because I added a whole load of game-based GUI Types and a Player Manager which are very useful components and it's still selling because people see that it's worth it too them :-)<br><br>Anyway thanks for your interest.  Hopefully when you see some of the games that will be coming out soon that are made with the framework they'll sway you towards it some more ;-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

(in other words: does it load tons of other modules, even if I don't want them?If yes, do I have control over that without changing your source code?)<br><br>- Can I still specify a "target" frame rate? (I'm an animator, so frame rate control is precious to me - higher is not always better!  :-)<br><br>- Can you post code examples that use your framework, just so we can have a better idea of how it's designed?

Event-based input is standard in BMax, it doesn't need Max GUI :-)<br>- As for modules.  I haven't told it which ones to load or not load, it simply uses whatever BMax chucks in as default (not very efficient I know) but you should be able to slim this down using the Framework keyword as long as you don't remove modules that my code uses...<br>- OK, there are 3 "framerates" to consider: 1) The screen refresh rate.  In windowed mode this is the desktop Hz, and in full-screen it's 60 unless you change it.  The refresh rate of the screen will not affect the game speed in any way. 2) The logic framerate, set to 200FPS for very smooth logic and mechanics etc. 3) the framerate you choose for your animations is independant of the other two.  In fact there is even a TAnimation Type.  Basically you setup a counter and a target in milliseconds that you adjust each logic frame by a delta amount, and when you draw your animated sprite you simply choose the appropriate frame depending on how far along the counter has got from 0 to the target millisecs.  There are functions to do this for you and also examples.  For example, when the counter is at 0, frame 0 is display, when the counter is halfway to the target, the middle frame is played etc.  It's all specially worked out so that each frame displays for the correct amount of time.  If you wanted to display some frames for longer, there are various techniques for doing this, the simplist being to build a list of frames to show from a possible list, and showing the same frame twice etc.<br><br>- Here's how easy it is to make a new screen:<br><pre class=code>

It's just that Attack of the Alien Greys was a bit of a let-down, compared to other games you've released, such as Absolute Blue.<br><br>Would it be possible to create a game like Absolute Blue using the Framework?  Or, I guess a better question might be, which features would one need to add to the framework (Other than obvious things like gameplay scripting and art assets) in order to make a game like AB?<br><br>Also, how much of a hassle would it be to integrate something like Simple Ogre Wrapper or another Max-3D solution, into the Grey Alien BMX Game Framework?  Could we just call the start, update and render commands at the right times, or are there other considerations?<br><br>I suspect that your framework will undoubtedly be a step up from my current framework of "Start with Digesteroids, replace all the art assets, and then start rewriting all the update() and start() methods."  But without seeing a really *nice* example game made using the Framework, it's kind of hard for me to judge whether it's a $50 step.<br><br>In particular, I'd like to see some of those "multi-phase animations" in action.  Your animation looked great in Absolute Blue, but in AOTMG, it's just these static images floating against the background and changing colour.

For example, the in-game menu is a TScreen that is shown on top of the TGameScreen.<br><br>1) Good question. The answer is both.  Lots of graphics are loading on the loading screen when the loading bar moves across.  However, they are kept in global lists and when the game screen and other screens need them, they are assigned to the objects.  When the screens are destroyed, the links are killed but the graphics are still in the global store. However, other things are loaded dynamically and destroyed dyanmically like the menus and screen backgrounds for example.  You can actually choose to do fully loaded or dynamic, or a mixture like I have.  This will depend on the size of your graphics data, and if you want to interrupt the user with loading screens or not of course.<br>2) Remember it's up to you how much of the AOTMG code you want to use in your game, or if you just want to use the framework components.  There is a TGameScreen Type in the AOTMG demo code, plus there is a TPlayer, TAlien, TBullet etc and lists to contain stuff.  These are all fields of TGameScreen however, there is nothing to stop you making them global if you prefer.<br>3) I have examples of collision detection built into the framework (in the AOTMG demo) (e.g. lists of sprites placed on a layer and objects tested against the layer) and some useful collision functions in my commoncode.bmx file.  However, the code framework doesn't have any collision code built in as the BMax collision code works well and people will want to use it in different ways.  Do you think I should add some specific functions?<br><br>Thanks for your interest.  Any more questions?  Just ask.<br><br>WarpZone: oops sorry for the misunderstanding.  I am just an affiliate for selling Absolute Blue, I liked it and so it's on my site but I didn't make it.  Sorry :-(  And yes, there is nothing in that game you couldn't do with my framework.  All the other stuff on the site is by me, BUT it's in Blitz Plus not BMax so it's not a decent measure of what the framework can do.  I moved to BMax as it's much more powerful and will help me achieve my game developement goals.  Watch out for a game called Sudoku Maya Gold coming out soon (it'll be on the forums), this was totally rewritten in my framework by Gellyware in order to get on some big portals and it is looking sweet!  Also, as you've identified, sprites can be animated at any framerate and the whole system is geared so it doesn't matter what Hz the screen is using, the anim will be the same.  As for the multi-part anims, this is actually in evidence by simple things like the high scores screen.  The scores that slide on the screen use 3 parts: 1 a delay in order to stagger the lines, 2 the slide itself, 3 a flash of colour when in the final position.  This same thing can be applied to sprites of course.  Finally, my new match-3 game will have plenty of animations in it and I've added a basic particle engine to the framework too (not released yet) and it's due out in August sometime... Anyway thanks for your interest, I hope you buy it :-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I think I'm going to scrap AOTMG and just start writing my own screens from scratch.<br><br>The AlienGrey Framework includes some great core features that no game should be without.  But the example game seems much more complicated than it needs to be.  <br><br>Making a simple change to AOTMG can be a big headache.  Example:<br><br><div class="quote"> <br>Want to move the logo down a few pixels on the title screen?  Okay, go into ScreenTypes and look for the main title screen.  The copyright image is drawn roughly the way one would expect, using a custom draw function, so that one's easy to change.  You might expect the title of the game to be as easily tweaked...  <br><br>But wait, the name of the logo graphic is not mentioned, for some reason.  For some reason, he's just calling DrawImage(image,screenwidth/2+x,screenheight/2+y), and values for x and y are nowhere in sight. The title graphic is an intrinsic property of the TTitleScreen type?  He's calling it to make the title screen "draw itself," as if it were a sprite.  Huh?<br><br>So then you've got to go into the TScreen Type TTitleScreen inherits from and look at its structure in order to understand what's going on with the logo graphic.  Okay, looks like each screen has an image field, but there's no other clues as to where the logo's x and y coordinates come from.<br><br>Eventually, I found it.  TTitleScreen not only ignores the default draw behavior, it also overrides the default loading behavior, with a method called SpecialLoad.  I eventually found the function call I was looking for, and I was able to deduce that within the line<br><br>HeaderLoad("logolarge",screenwidth/2,50) 'this gets midhandled automatically<br><br>"50" was obviously the number I wanted to change.  I tweaked it to 75, and now my slightly-larger title looks great... except the menu is too high.  Another 45 minutes of hide-and-seek.  Oh, there we go, I just change this number and it'll move the menu down.  But now the text "welcome (playername)" is still overlapping the title... apparently that string isn't part of the menu... Maybe it's in the TTitleScreen draw function?  DrawWelcome()!?  Where the heck is DrawWelcome() declared!?<br> <br></div><br><br>And so on.  I could have made my changes to the look and feel of the title screen in a couple of minutes if all the drawing had just been done in the in the Draw() method! <br><br>It's the same way with changing anything.  Graphics, input, gameplay...  Almost every feature or object, no matter how simple, is spread over three or more bmx's that are all integrated with each other.  Renaming a graphic can take 20 minutes because you have to hunt down all the references to it and change them, and said references are sprinkled liberally throughout the Framework's much-flaunted 10,000 lines of code.  Even with BLide's Find feature, I still have to scour 6 bmx's, to make sure I don't miss anything.<br><br>Bottom line: I don't know what the heck I'm doing.  Everyone else is singing the praises of this Framework, so I guess I'm the only one having trouble.<br><br>Hmmm.  Maybe that's my problem.  I'm trying to rebuild AOTMG into a game I'd already started using Digesteroids as my base... maybe I should be building my own main BMX from scratch instead?<br><br>I certianly wouldn't add 20 methods with unique names to every screen.  All you really need is a Start(), End(), Update(), and Draw().  Anything more complicated than that and the overall program flow gets lost to anyone not already intimately familiar with AOTMG.  <br><br>Black boxes are great if you've got a team of programmers and you don't plan on changing any functionality after an object is tested and working.  But if I'm one single Blitz user, and I pick up your project cold, I'm going to have to edit dozens of black boxes just to make one minor change to the fundamental game.  I think the framework would be a lot more approachable if the demo application were simpler.  More linear.  At least in places.<br><br>I'm not saying the framework is more trouble than it's worth.  Cuz event-based input is worth a heck of a lot of trouble!  I'm just saying the example game that ships with the framework is a LOT more trouble than it needs to be, in order to perform a simple task like making a spaceship slide back and forth on the screen at a fixed speed.<br><br>If I can come up with a simpler, more intuitive, more approachable demo game, I will certianly send it to Grey Alien, so he can show off the framework in a manner that's a bit easier for beginners to read and understand.  That way, we could have a simple example and an OOP example.  <br><br>Unless of course I'm the only one who wasn't able to "dive right in and start making my game!" using AOTMG as a starting point.  What do you think, guys?  Am I crazy?  Or am I just using the framework wrongly? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That's what I meant by "Admittedly, there were some 'quirks' at first with it... " <br><br>However, once you understand how the framework works... it does get easier. I found myself using a combination of the framework menu system and my own for menu input. As you mentioned, everyone has their own style of coding so what makes sense to Grey doesn't neccessarily make sense to others as far as organization or execution.<br><br>I personally would prefer a stripped down framework with just the basic event handling and TScreens. Of course you can simply do this by not implementing the other functionality. <br><br>I'm considering writing an 'engine' that combines the framework with swifts system to make a drag and drop type app to quickly put together the screens like you can do with Torque Game Builder (which I'm considering converting to mainly because of the visual feedback). It would be great if some blitzers could combine forces and make something similar to that. Coding GUI's/menu locations/tile locations/events/animation, you name it is a pain in the arse sometimes that doesn't neccessarily have to be the grunt work that it already is.<br><br>Imagine an all in one package that is visually orientated with this framework + iglass + swifts sprite system + fishEd.

Of course when you know what to modify things are simple and just a number or one line will make a big difference.<br><br>The other important thing to remember is due to inheritance, if you see a variable (or method call) in and extended type, like Header, and you can't see it declared as a field/method, this means that it is a field/method in the base-type.<br><br>So for TTitlescreen, you can't see what Header is, so you go straight to TScreen (the base-type) in the main CommonTypes file and can see Header declared and how it's loaded and drawn.  You can also see that Header is a TSprite and so if you look up TSprite you can see it has X and Y coords etc. Obviously you can set these to position the header, or in fact move it around and because it's a TSprite you can scale and rotate it too!  Header is part of TScreen because it's usefull to nearly all screens - most screens need a header.  And if you had to load and draw it manually each time it would be a pain.  Furthermore if you wanted to move it round and started adding HeaderX and HeaderY fields to your screen this would be redundant when you could add this sort of functionality to the base-type for code reuse (which I did).<br><br>As for DrawWelcome(), I made it a method because I wasn't sure how large it was going to be.  It's useful not to have a Draw() or Logic() function that is cluttered with tons of lines of code, better to have several one-line method calls, and each method call contains several lines.  Then you can see at a glance what the draw method does (in overview) and you only have to look at the detailed code in the methods if you need to.  Believe me, after years of coding, having concise methods that call other methods like this is much more preferable (I don't always do it though, slap my wrists).<br><br>Also, with DrawWelcome(), a quick search using the IDE search facility would have found where it was declared.  But logic dictates that it's either a) a method of the Title Screen, b) a method of the base type or c) a function stored elsewhere. Now, I try to avoid c) where possible (as this is the hardest to find) so it's either a) or b) and it's easy enough to search for the method in the current type first  In fact DrawWelcome() declared was ONLY 5 LINES BELOW where it was called, so it was totally obvious imho. I try to bunch the draw methods together in types, and logic methods together.<br><br>I appreciate you would like to see all the drawing in one place with no calls to base-class methods/fields or to methods in the same type, and I used to program like this too, but as your projects get larger, this approach becomes unmanageable.  The BMax IDE is good as it shows all the methods in the pane on the right so if you are looking at TTitleScreen you can see it has a DrawWelcome method.  Using the IDE and find tools well really helps with big projects.  For 10 years I worked on a &gt;300,000 line piece of Client/Server SQL powered Delphi software and the early bits of it were not well structured but overtime it got much better and using the IDEs tools to find stuff was pretty important.  Of course I don't know your skill level and experience so please forgive me if I have said stuff you already know :-)<br><br>Anyway, I agree that a simpler demo is now required (and that stuff like SpecialLoad() are confusing (this was added so the title screen data can be loaded by the LoadingScreen))  and I'll try to make one soon (maybe when I finish my current game).  Also if you make a small demo you are willing to contribute as you said, then that would be really great.  Thanks for your support and kind words, I'm sure that over time you'll see why I did it in the way I did - although everyone programs in different ways of course...however, I'd like to think that lots of people can learn something from my code as I am reasonably experienced ;-)<br><br>*****<br>Hi Cruis.In, thanks for your interest.

It is designed to wrap whatever game you decide to make in a professional package.  Having said that, puzzlers would be easy to make without any additions, apps may not be suited as it's not a Max-GUI app, although you can use my game-based GUI stuff.  Shoot-em ups could be made easily enough with the sprites etc and with the addition of Splines. Scrolling games and platform games would need an appropriate engine coding.  3D games would need the 3D code plugged into it etc.  Hope this clarifies a little bit.  I really need more examples than AOTMG (a space invaders stype shooter) to show it off.  Well there is Gellyware's Sudoku Maya Gold game (on Real Arcade) and my forthcoming match-3 game.  I also plan to make a platformer in it soonish and perhaps even turn AOTMG into a proper game (as in more game variety and purpose). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Specifically, it makes adding and properly applying music a breeze. Also, the built-in menu functions take a real load off when building an interface. It's nice to be able to just Super.Logic() away things like mouseover effects and button click sounds.<br><br>The organization of the framework was very hard for me to get used to. Pretty much everything about the structure used by Grey Alien's framework is different from my own style of organization. However, once I figured it out, I found that I liked it. The framework structure makes it easy to keep your logic and drawing seperate without much effort. One step back from that, the framework makes it easy to organize your program by treating each piece as a "Screen", which was a bit foreign to my experience but which, in the end, I think is a great way to approach game development.<br><br>I also like the built-in sprite functions. It's a snap to make things spin and zoom around.<br><br><b>The less good</b><br>I don't find the code to be nearly as "heavily commented" as claimed. 90% of the commenting seems to be version updates: "v 0.8.1 - Added BlahWhatever() function". I think the documentation in general is very lacking. The sample program is nice but it seems to assume you already understand the organizational structure used by the framework. Personally, I did not understand it at all when I first started to use Grey Alien's framework and it was a big hurdle to overcome; I found myself following the tedious process of deleting lines one at a time to figure out what the hell they did.<br><br>I really don't like how a lot of the functions make assumptions about what I want. When you add a menu item, it is centered whether you like it or not (as far as I can tell). Yes, you can change that later, but why should you have to? it is not hard to add an option to the function parameters or add a Game.MenuOrientation flag that can be set by the user. Instead, I have to execute a findbutton and then set the the new values. I bump into that sort of thing a lot in the framework. Another example is the hardcoded "MO" for mouseover states. It's not a big deal, but why hardcode any string into the functions? Again, prefix and suffix function parameters or TMenu fields that could be set would do the trick.<br><br>Another small issue is that some functions I would expect to find just don't exist. Grey Alien included a nice "AddPair()" method for menu building and has a "SetPairX()" function, but no "SetPairY()". Yes, the AddXXX() functions automatically y-position buttons relative to each other, but that's no reason not to have a function that lets me override the y axis just like I can do for x.<br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br>I found a lot of small annoyances when experimenting with the framework, but they are only small annoyances. It is also possible that some of the annoyances stem from my lack of experience with the framework, but I am sure that is not the case for all of them. The framework's functionality seems to be everything that it is claimed to be. I think Grey Alien's game framework is definitely suitable for commercial games as well as hobby projects but I think it could use some internal reworking to make it more comfortable and flexible from a development standpoint.<br><br>SpaceAce <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The majority of my app is somewhat 'menu/gooey' driven - and due to this I have benefited immensely form the framework. <br><br>Yes, it does take a little time to get your head around some things, but in the main I've found the framework a fantastic jumping off point.  I'm not even sure I would have purchased BMax had it not been for Grey's framework.<br><br>I fear that without Grey's framework my project may have stagnated (I gave up developing it in B3D - I couldn't optimise it as much as I would have liked.

It's been sent now.<br><br>SpaceAce: Many thanks for your feedback. I'm glad that you have found it good and useful and I accept what you have said about the minor niggles.  Initially this framework was just for me, so I wrote the functionality that I needed instead of making everything (like the menu stuff) ultra-flexible (although there is always a way to get it how you want of course).  Then eventually I realised that other people would also find it useful as a good starting point in BMax and thus started selling it - and it has proved very popular.  As a result of the way I developed it (cramming in the stuff that I need as I go along) there may be minor things that people would like to see that seem obvious, but they are not there as I haven't sat down and exhaustively analysed and planned each type - and I'm sorry about that.  Anyway, I hope you've found that the positives far outweigh the niggles.  I aim to improve the getting started document (and make simpler examples) soon as well, which will help new users.  Once again thanks for your feedback.<br><br>Blitzplotter: Really glad it's proving such a boon for you.  Sorry but I'm not doing a B3d version as I don't own it :-( <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But all the sprites have a scale parameter so it would be easy enough to set that accordingly before drawing and then when they are drawn it will be applied automatically.  In my AOTMG demo you can see I zoomed in and out on the map screen for a neat effect.<br><br>As for plugging your code into mine, this should be OK because you can paste your logic code into my wrapper function and the drawing code into my drawing wrapper functions.  As for timing, well I already have a certain method that depends on a global variable called Delta, so whenever you move something or alter a timer it must be multiplied by Delta - you should be able to convert you code easily enough.  You can still use you existing types, but you may find it easier to convert over to some of mine.<br><br>My framework can either be used as a whole thing that you plug into or you can just rip the bits out of it that you want and use those.  You're bound to find some useful stuff in there and maybe learn some new techniques too.<br><br>I'm also in the process of making some *simpler* examples because the AOTMG source code is quite big now and some people have asked for a simpler example to help the understand the structure more.  There is also a getting started doc that discusses my TScreen Type and how the game is structured.  I can help debug/write your game but if you need help to understand how the framework is structured/works then you can email me for support.  My customers seem to rate my support highly so I'm sure you'll get on fine.<br><br>Any more questions please ask.  Perhaps use the other thread if possible?  Thanks. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
