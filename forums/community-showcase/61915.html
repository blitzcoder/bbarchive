Thanks!<br><br>&gt; Holding Up/Down on normal ground makes the guy moonwalk<br>- Yep, covered that one in the readme.txt file.  As I said in there I know it's broke, but I have to leave something to fix.  Right? :)<br><br>&gt; Control configuration possibly? I always kept pressing Up to activate objects/enter doorway when the game wants you to hit Ctrl.<br>- Oh yes.  When the proper demo is complete you'll be able to configure it all as you like.<br><br>&gt; Areas 3 &amp; 4 are the same in your demo.<br>- Nope.  The layout is the same.  But level 4 introduces the player to timed controlers that revert back after they expire.  I could change the layout but I figured that keeping it the same would make it easier to see the difference between a timed &amp; non-timed controller.   <br><br>&gt; Possibly make the fan actually blow you back a bit when you near an active one?<br>- I had this at one time but I got into trouble with collisions and eventually had to change it to this format.  The sliding was a cool feature but it just broke too many things so I had to change it to more of a 1 way type passage.  If I felt strongly that I could make the sliding work I'd pursue it.  But I lost too much time already to trying to get it to behave.<br><br>&gt; Allow the mouse to click the Ok button before a stage starts<br>- Unless I put mouse control back into the gameplay segment I think it's better to not have this option so the player moves his attention to the keyboard.<br><br>&gt; I feel ingame mouse control may be worth a time investment if you can get a pathfinding system going so the guy can head to a clicked destination.<br>- I had it in for months.  The problem was how do I discern from a 'move to here' mouse click and an 'activate this' mouse click.  The only clean system I came up with was using right mouse click to activate an item.  But it was so demanding that the game slipped away from the 'casual' genre.  When all other items are addressed I'll come back to see if I can mouse control plugged back in and working well.  In the meantime, it's keyboard only.<br><br>&gt; Anychance of adding to the animation where the guy gets zapped that he keels over in the end?<br>- Yeah, it is a little plain.  I think I was just tired and said 'good enough'.  I'll come back around to it eventually and see if I can add some more.<br><br>&gt; I feel that the transport routes should automatically move your player down in the direction it's currently set to upon setting foot in it. (and possibly at a faster rate of speed)<br>- This one I'll have to disagree on.  If you're sliding down the tube as a robot is walking by underneath you the last thing you'll want is  to uncontrollably slide right into your doom.  So I'll leave the controls in the player's hands.  In some of the proper challenging levels you'll see how important manual control will be.<br><br>&gt; Cant replicate this,  [crash]<br>- Doh!  I'll keep my fingers crossed that it was just a hiccup.<br><br>&gt; Possibly consider adding a "shut-off" effect to the laser beams?<br>- You know, I figured that the sound effect (once it's added) would be enough to sell it.  But I think you're completely right.  When all the main stuff is addressed I'll come back to this one as well.<br><br><br>Great stuff!  This is exactly the kind of testing and constructive comments I'm looking for.  Thanks again. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Nuclear Glory v2 was pretty good. v3 came out and it was a disaster.  Didn't work at all and was twice as slow as v2 on the rare occasions when it did work!  He's been working on v4 ever since.  It sounds promising (and he swears that he's still creating a B3D version) but no idea when B3D v4 will actually see the light of day.  I bought v3 (unaware it didn't work, obviously) and was later given a license to v2.  And that's what I used.  And to be honest it worked like a champ!  Like anything it has quirks.  But as you can see from this teaser demo it does indeed work.  It was $15 (or was it $20?) well spent.  Couldn't have gotten the game finished without it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Cool!<br>&gt; Anychance if having a shadow appear on the bottom floor when player is using a ladder or transport?<br>-I thought about that.  I'll put that on my 'when I can get to it' list.  I agree it'd be a nice touch.<br><br>&gt; Font is too aliased for my tastes at lower resolutions, speaking mainly for 640x480 (hard on my eyes), but it aint so sharp @ 800x600 either as it could be, possibly consider a different font, or bump the resolution up for the lower displays?<br>-That's cool.  I'll address that.<br><br>&gt; Seems to be a small seam in the texture used behind the transport effect, noticed it testing at a low-rez, but it's also there at higher, just another nitpick.<br>-Check out the eagle eyes!!  I'm mirroring the texture and the lower res mipmap is picking up the edges (which are black).  I'll go back, when time permits, and clean up the textures.  That'll take care of all the texture creases (there's others but I won't point them out :) )<br><br>&gt; Anychance of non-4:3 aspect-ratio resolution choices? Alot of LCDs these days run 1280x1024 as their native rez.<br>-Not very likely.  I had a 1280x1024 res that kept messing up.  Turned out that I had hard coded tons of stuff that required a 1.33 aspect ratio.  It was an obvious mistake.  But I think it'd be too much to address at this point and I'd probably just break more things in the process.  Rookie mistake for sure, but this is my first game. :)  I promise the next game will have 16:9 settings for sure!<br><br>&gt; the demo takes 100mb of ram here<br>-Yep, I load it all so levels display instantly.  There's major bloat at the moment.  But once textures are optimized that number will come down a lot.<br><br>@Matty -actually that was intentional.  The camera moves ahead to help show what's coming up and gradually.  There's a delay to the camera movements to allow it to ease in and out.  I thought it looked prettier than having it snap quickly back into place.  If more people comment on this then I might make it selectable and give an option to have the camera lock on the whole time.<br><br>@Red October<br>&gt;the transport tube level allowed me to reset the direction of the tube to up, and once i got up, i was trapped up there...<br>-You have to open the door (key computer) before you go back up the tube.  Some levels will allow you to get stuck and force you to reset.  That's part of the challenge.  But then again, this is a tutorial level.  So it's probably a good idea to add one at the top in this case.  I'll do that.<br><br>@Amon &gt;All it needs now are some big levels and lots of baddies. :) <br>-Yep, yep,yep.  That's what I'll be putting my full attention on very shortly. :)<br><br>Thanks for the input guys! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'll do that.

At this point it's too difficult reworking that code so I'm stuck with 1.33 resolutions for this game.<br><br>@Pete Carter - Lightwave.  It was all Lightwave 3D.  <br><br>@Grisu - Nope, can't do the 1280x1024.  See my note to polygoon.<br><br>@Blitzsupport - I know it's a little mixed up having keys and mouse for the menus and then keys only for the gameplay.  But seeing that it's unlikely that I'll get the mouse gameplay working, that only leaves me with the choice of yanking the mouse control from the menus and making everything keyboard only.  Won't people be complaining that the mouse doesn't work on the menus?  Hmm... I'll ponder. <br>-The tubes have to be left manual without any inertia.  You don't get the danger on these tutorial levels but there'll be pleanty of times where you'll want to stop on a dime.  Trust me on the one.<br>The zoom is a little to quick?  I'll add a feature that allows you to adjust that.<br><br>@Liberator - I picked Andy Schatz's brain (Venture Africa) and he said the same thing about the IGF deadline.  But there's tons of competition so I'm trying to get as much of it polished and ready as I can.  I went to GDC last March as an observer.  I'd really like to go again next year as a contestant. :)  <br><br>Thanks again, guys.  For over a year now I've been spending nights and weekends banging away at this game.  This is really the first time that this thing has seen daylight.

Runs fine (see specs below)<br><br>Things I noticed and things you should tweak:<br><br>- Your main character mesh intersects with the wall if you walk into it. So the hand or foot will go into the wall. Very minor but I noticed it.<br><br>- You should have an animation if you try and walk into a wall. Perhaps make him push it.. or lean on it.. something. At the moment it looks weird that he runs on the spot.<br><br>- I agree with blitzsupports mouse menu point of view. My initial reaction was "hmm is the game not working properly?, how am I going to click this button where is the cursor?" that was until I read the text "press ctrl".<br><br>- When you go through the floor force fields. (the bits on level 2) .. there should be some kind of glowy ring in the field. A bit like say in stargate when they go through the wormhole, there is a ripple.<br><br>- Need some comedy idle animations. If you stop moving for a while, play one of a few idle animations. Maybe Biting nail.. looking around.. scratching head.. that sort of thing.<br><br>- Would be good to be able to press up to activate stuff and go through doors.<br><br>- Im not too keen on the contrast of the blue surrounding.<br><br>Its looking ace tho.
