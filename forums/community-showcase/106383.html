Lest assume the campaign is blow up the bridge. The computer will have to defend the bridge<br>5. the decks. lets take the concept of decks and spin them into deck types. E.G. english, german, american, ww1, ww2, space warfare, goblins, hippy flower children. internally they are all the same just with different attack,defence, graphics, etc (ala top-Trumps)<br>6. just because a card has a high value, does not mean it will win against another card of a different type. E.G. Grande Launcher (5) would win against people throwing grenades (3), but could have a 'chance' to win affairs a machine gun turret (10) - So there is now a slight chance element, and also skill<br>7. have each round played in different orders, probably based on the results of the previous round. E.G. computer won last round - it decides if it wants to go first (place the next round of cards) or make you go first. The detail here is the first to play a hand could be at a disadvantage, as the second player know what has just been played, and my counteract with a different set of cards.<br>8. when a card is played, it disappears. and you will get dealt cards to replace the ones lost. so low scoring cards will hang around?<br>9. a hand is a comparison of 6 cards - 3 from each side<br>10. dump holding a card - simplify.<br>11. each 'round'/'hand' could have a subgoal, there might be different routes to take on the map to achieve the main goal<br>12. the map itself could form part of the process. E.G. firing/throwing grades from a hill would score more and more chance of success that doing the same with a forest in the way. of course the edge of the forest would provide cover, etc<br><br>graphics<br>- divide the window into 3 vertical areas (top, middle, bottom)<br>- the top would be the computer cars played, the bottom your cards played, the middle would show the map<br>- show the cards being dealt face down<br>- show the cards being played and animated<br>- show how one card 'trumps' the other card <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I just added Number of HAnds played, and a check after 100 hands whos winning etc..<br><br>the game deals 7 cards each, and then the A.I. picks from them, the A.I. is real not just thrown a random output, the cards dealt are 1 leader card, 2 infantry cards, 2 armor cards, 2 bombardment cards. then depending on the terrain fought, gives a different bonus, I need to make this clear in the game I think.<br><br><br>Also different cards trump others depending on what ground the battle is fought.

const CARDSTATE_BACK:int = 1
const CARDSTATE_DEALT:int = 2
This gets rid of a coding nasty called "magic numbers" where a number appears to do something, and you have to search through the code to find out what it does. 

</pre><br>in the drawcard function we can now have<br><pre class=code>
if cardstate = CARDSTATE_BACK then
 'draw the back of the card
else
 'draw the front of the card
