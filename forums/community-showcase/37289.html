Original game. Needed if you did *NOT* download the first demo, otherwise you already have this.<br><br>-[ New Patch 1 release ] - (Download this if you're not sure)<br><a href="http://kamikazekrow.com/antony/CryoPatch1.rar" target="_blank">http://kamikazekrow.com/antony/CryoPatch1.rar</a> &lt; only 700k.<br><br><br>Anyway, patch 1 requires the original game, but the upshot is it's a MUCH smaller download.<br>-<br><br>Installation:<br> Copy all files into main alpha1 folder. And run newly supplied exe, instead of alpha1 .exe. And that's it. No need to copy any files in folders this time :)<br><br>No enemies, because I wanted the focus to be on the path finding.. It's not 100% perfect yet, but it's a *big* step up from the last one.(Which had no path finding at all, other than the formation)<br><br>Also, added laser scopes(To yours and team mates)<br><br>Added (imo) very cool swoosh sounds. Now go into bullet time and fastly move your gun etc, it'll cut through the air. (the sound dynamically alters pitch/volume depending on motion, so it's pretty belivable)<br><br>Turned off bloom and shadows completely, so you can focus on trying the game out. (I could come up with some bs story why this is a good thing, or I could just admit I forget to turn them back on before uploading...pick one which makes you less angry and go with it ;) )<br><br><br>Anyway, that's about it..most of the time went on the dynamic path finding.<br><br>another patch in a few days. (probably)<br><br>-Controls-<br>(Hold) = Run <br><br>V(Hold) = Crouch <br><br>Space (Toggle) = Raise/Lower gun <br><br>Q (Hold) = Lock heading and control aim. (I.e control the upper torso alone) <br><br>E (Hold) = Lean. Hold in and move mouse left/right. <br><br>R =Reload <br><br>T= Use. <br>-- <br><br>Lmb = Fire gun. <br><br>Rmb = Enter Bullet time/Focus mode. <br>- <br><br>Team order system is pretty simple to use, everything done using your mouse wheel/button (No menus) <br><br>Press up on the mouse wheel to order your squad(3 npcs in the demo) to the location your pointer is at. (i.e point where you want them to go) <br><br>Press down (Without button) to order your squad to retreat. Unless your cursor is close to you, in which case it becomes 'Hold this position' <br><br>Holding in the third mouse button/mouse wheel = Mouse gestures. 3rd button and Down (As in move the mouse down, not the mouse wheel) = regroup and get information. Your squad will try to follow, trying to avoid geo etc. <br><br>3rd button and left = reload. 3rd button and right =use. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
