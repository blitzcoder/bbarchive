I mean; I know that you're talking about a graphical standard, but it really depends on how you wish to sell it (well, I'd presume). I've seen stuff sell okay online without even half the graphical standard, but I guess they had pretty good gameplay... But if you mean big money modern commercial games... Well I don't think so (graphivcally speaking)... Though the modeling and textures are great, I'd say the engine would hold it back. (Hope that doesn't sound to rude, I'm half asleep and in the mood to type).<br><br>Did you code the shadow functions yourself? If so, I'd advise adding a blur texture function inside the library... And falloff via vertex distance from the light source so the shadows don't just look so flat.<br><br>I think a subtle bloom filter would sort of look nice over the work aswell... Not that I'm a big fan of the standard way bloom looks in blitz (I mean the over used low-res texture overlay), but if you could find a subtle way that doesn't scream "low res texture!", it could really help it along (in my opinion). Maybe modifying texture blur code to work with the bloom layer... not sure.<br><br>Anywho, good luck, and I'd love to see a tech demo some time. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
