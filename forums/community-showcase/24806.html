I can't believe you wrote this in only 7 weeks!  I still think the EASY mode is tooo hard, but once I figured some things out, I was able to complete your demo.  <br><br>A couple of simple suggestions, move your hud to the left or right corner.  It takes up a lot of screen space in the top center.  Also, make the Timer more easy to see.  It gets kind of lost when your placing towers and in a hurry.  Going all the way back to level 1 everytime you lose is very frustrating.  A save between levels is essential!<br><br>I really enjoyed the demo.  I just think the difficulty on EASY would stop me from buying this game.  I am sure you can adjust that.  An old guy like me doesn't have a quick mind or quick hands anymore! :(<br><br>Thanks,<br>MK <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I arranged my blocks so there was a nice bottle neck for all the abyss' minions to go down where I had 3 Arbaleste targetted with freezer towers to slow em up too, but I just didnt earn enuff money to make upgrades and withstand the onslaught on level 4 lol. Also 3 seems to be the limit on Arbaleste?<br><br>Make it easier, and have the tutorial tell u exactly what to do to win the first 3 levels so the basic strategy is picked up quicker (maybe even a rolling demo that you can watch).<br><br>Ok, since writing this I it occurred to me that u might be able to upgrade Arbaleste, and u can, so now my bottle neck worked and I completed the demo! But I still think it should be easier/point this stuff out abit better.<br><br>Think I might purchase the full version..Good luck with the publisher! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It seemed way too hard at first but once I figured out some basic strategy it got a lot easier; now I can do the entire demo without getting hit/losing a single life.<br><br>What you really need to do is improve the tutorial.  For example, I can't figure out how to use the Arbaleste (which is probably just as well since the Marines are a waste of money; you mostly just want to build lots of laser, flame, and freezer towers.)  Similarly, creating bottlenecks by clustering towers is a pretty basic necessity but you don't mention that in the tutorial. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

One of the few games made in blitz that I've went back and played more than a couple times. The terrain looks great too. <br><br>I agree the degree of difficulty is a little high on easy. The difficulty curve should be more gradual. Like say, have only one group of spikes appear at the first "level", then two, then three. It is hard to point the arbaleste in the direction you want. A suggestion to remedy that: have the target placed at the location of the cursor (or at the same angle) when you press space (with an arbaleste selected). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Good animation/control/sfx/visuals.<br>I believe this game will rank alongside other top Blitz games out there such as 'Juno Nemesis' and 'Platypuss'.<br><br>Suggestions then:<br>a) How about an indicator above the selected character?<br>I don't know which marine is active after clicking the shortcut for instance.<br>b) Change the fonts for lives remaining &amp; timer.

(or at least a symbol that stands out a little more)<br>      - it wasn't apparent to me that you could move the marines etc. when the enemies were attacking, I was under the impression that you set everything up and watched the battle (i thought that was cool though)<br>      - the Abalaste (spelling?) didn't do anything (ie. didn't attack enemies)<br>      - I found the scrolling to be too fast; and the cursor keys to be a little out of place in terms of control. ie. Age of empires scrolls when the pointer reaches the edge of the screen. I think this is pretty much the standard in these types of games. (starting with command &amp; conquer)<br>      - I think the graphics are excellent, however the star things (when killed) look like they gush blood before melting into the ground. I'd be more satisfied with a hearty explosion followed by some scattered debry (followed by smoke trails) it kind of looks out of place<br>      - There is no animation or effect when a creature reaches your ship, sure - the life counter decrements, however it would be nice for some sort of flash or something to occur. I was playing with the volume down &amp; found myself staring at the life counter at times where creatures were under heavy fire but just reaching the ship.<br>      - Going back to the money thing, you could make your money-in-the-bank counter flash white &amp; decrement the amount of money by 1 (say every .2 of a second) in a loop when you buy stuff. That would make it instantly obvious whats going on. (ie. it counts down, like a poker machine)<br>      - In my opinion the difficulty is fine, I beat the game on my second attempt - I was wanting more! <br>      - There is a bug that I haven't been able to reproduce where after playing a few games in a row the main menu ceases to function properly, ie clicking on start takes you to options<br>       - Rotating around the landscape would be cool, as well as zoom. Especially zoom, I found myself wanting this badly.<br>       - I favor the left mouse button for building, although I got used to the right button, I notice there is an option for this in Age of empires; so some others must feel the same<br>       - Flying things could benefit greatly from shadows<br>       - After I spent the big dollars on the Mega Tower I was dissapointed in it's intelligence, for some reason it didn't attack those closest to my ship, for that matter all the turrets seem to behave in this manner, i think they should put a priority on attacking enemies closest to your home ship. ie. I had a situation where I built a long corridor with the ship at the end, at the entrance I put 5 towers - at one point I became overun and a few enemies started down the corridor, they were ignored over the incoming enemies some distance from the entrance.<br>      <br>In addition, on my VAIO PCG-FXA47 notebook it looked like nighttime (the landscape was black) until I was positioning a building, at which point the game looked normal - however after building the tower the landscape reverted to darkness. It was unplayable in this incarnation. Graphics card = 8MB ATI RAGE MOBILITY M1. On my GeForce 2 card it was fine.<br><br>Ok, now I've spent time giving you some feedback - can you do me a favor? I think the text effect on the credits screen is fantastic, how did you do this?<br><br>Cheers,<br>-R <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
