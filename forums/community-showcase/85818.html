Whilst I'm sure each alien type has a well-crafted and unique movement pattern, the way all the aliens come on and off screen during a wave just feels all-too random.  In truth, the entire game (or the entire demo I played - and I didn't make it past the 15th-or-so oh-so-similar level because I just couldn't take it anymore) feels like one of those quick tests people do to make sure graphics display correctly and sounds activate correctly etc... "This is just a test - I'll sort out the proper alien movement later".  It feels like the annoying end part of a Galaga level when the main convoy is destroyed and you're just cleaning up the last few stragglers... but for every wave, the entire wave, over and over...<br><br>I had been working on the "if you can't say anything nice don't say anything at all" line of thinking, but it's just such a shame to see you so seriously bummed.

That kind of price point will encourage them to look at other options.<br><br>As far as space beetles goes these are the points I would consider:<br>- The graphics are very nice but, IMHO, aimed probably too young demographically<br>- The alien arrivals not having some sort of pattern leaves out the possibility of "Getting to know" the game.  That aspect is very important as it gives the gamer the ability to improve each time they play and "hooks" them in.  Bonuses for killing a complete wave on arrival.. yes, these points do come from games like Galaga... but that sells...you just need to add a unique flavor of those aspects to your game.  Lets admit it here, most games are new flavors of other games.<br><br>If I were you, I would try darkening the graphics (maybe an arch-angel fending off various demons) to seek an older demographic, add waves and bonuses and release it as a new game... who knows... you could still recover some of your investment. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

For the artwork alone.  And the music would have been another three to five grand.<br><br>And I know I'm taking a gamble now.  <br><br>But this time, I'm not taking nearly as big a gamble.  Worst case scenario here is STG doesn't sell well at $65 and I have to drop the price back to $35.

There may not be enough time between waves to really sense it though.  I didn't want to leave the player sitting there waiting three to five seconds for more enemies to appear on the screen.  <br><br>Perhaps I should have coded that bit diffently.  When a wave appears, a counter starts for the next wave.  Maybe I should have instead had a timer that counts down till all the enemies have spawned, and then had a second timer which counts down after there are no longer any enemies on the screen.  I just didn't think it would be all that fun if the player kept having to hunt down on enemy on the screen before more showed up.  I figured if I gave them 10-20 seconds to kill all the enemies, the threat level would drop as they kileld them and then be ramped up again once a new batch arrived.<br><br>The only way to really know what works is playtesting.  And I ran out of time to experiment unfortunately.<br><br><br>Weibo:<br>I had around ten people playtest it at various stages of the development.  <br><br>The last people to playtest it were my sister and her husband.  My sister would fling the ship into an enemy on the other side of the screen when trying to avoid a shot, and blow up anyway.  Her husband was as good at it as I am and easily killed all the enemies.  As a result of that I added the laser powerups, and drastically reduced the number of enemies on the earlier levels, since my sister was closer to the demographic I was targeting.<br><br><br>Chroma:<br>Play it some more and you'll find you have no difficulty hitting the enemies.  I'm not great at space shooters myself and I have no difficulty blasting them all.  Especially after powering up the laser which can easily destory wide swatchs of enemies.<br><br>I'm not saying your complaint isn't legitimate, just that... it's a problem.  <br><br>If I made the enemies move any slower then the game wouldn't be any fun once you played it for a few hours.  And making them move slower isn't a matter of tweaking one variable.  They all move based on animation timing, and that timing is tied to the animation of everything else in the game.  Basically there's a state system which says do this do this then do this, at these specific times, and on top of that there's animation code which says do this for this period of time or until this condition is met.<br><br>Just slowing them down would be a ton of work, and simply slowing them down isn't an acceptable solution for the reason outlined above, so I'd need to slow them down on earlier levels and then speed them up, or provide multiple difficulty levels where they move at different speeds.  Lot of work.<br><br>Now, I'd be willing to do that work... if I thought it would make the game sell.  But at this point, I don't think there's anything I could do to make this game sell.  I could turn it into a straight galaga clone with enemies flying in patterns and attacking from a grid if you miss them, occasionally diving at the player... But then there'd be little to no variety from level to level, and it would be a generic space shooter.  And generic space shooters simply don't sell.<br><br>Also, no matter what I do to the game, nobody is going to be interested in publishing it in stores.  Only one publisher expressed any interest in the game, and though they thought it was a lot of fun, and even went so far as to request box art, ultimately they decided they didn't think they could market a shooter.  No publisher ever wrote back to me and said they felt the game had promise but needed improvement before they could accept it.<br><br>Ps:<br><br>Regarding the lack of sales of shooters, I would be very surprised if anyone told me that chicken invaders sold more than 20 copies a month.  And at $9.95, this game would have to sell 5-10 copies a DAY in order for me to consider it to be somewhat of a success.<br><br>Do any of you think that any of these improvements you suggest could cause the game sell 30x better and go from selling six copies a month to selling 6 copies a DAY?<br><br>That's why I'm working on my texture generator instead of improving the game.  Doubling sales of my texture generator is a LOT easier than getting my game to sell 30x as many copies. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
