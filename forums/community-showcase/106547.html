You can play with the colours, but again keeping them sorta in range of each other is a better bet, but it gives you something to begin with and a great place to experiment :)<br><br>lastly. Purple was expensive and usually only worn by the emperor, etc. lower grades would probably have more muted earth tone shirts? ochres, buff, browns, tan, etc<br><br>ok. that the senators sorted. I wracked my brains about the next step for a bit and came up with this:<br>we are now looking head on, so can use some artistic licence and drop half the senate and concentrate on just the facing bit.<br><br>There are three tiers so we will need 3 steps and a background:<br><img src="https://vjointeractive.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/board.png"><br><br>I've used bucket loads of artistic licence here, if you are wondering where the bg comes from it's actually a 3d render that is then modded and re photoshopped with the steps, etc<br><br>So a senator should now sit just in the middle of each step:<br><img src="https://vjointeractive.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/boardx.png"><br><br>You can see how I've desaturated the bg and blurred the far bg to make the senator pop out, using different coloured senators, you now have a senate to play with.<br><br>One last thing<br>The 3 tiers of the senate also denoted their rank. high ranking at the front, low ranking at the back<br><br>using a bit of thought in a group there should be 1 high rank, and 2 low ranks, middle rank could be 1 or 2?<br><br>if you (the player) started as a tribune (lowest consul rank representing the people) the aim could be to work (bribe, assassinate, etc) your way up the ladder to become emperor<br><br>That would give you a name: Beat The Senate<br><br>ok one (really) last thing.
