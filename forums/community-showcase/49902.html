With the player having a choice of being a trader, bountyhunter, miner, etc. But there are plenty of those games out there and the project was getting so big I could see it never getting finished. So, I decided to concentrate on the combat side and make a pure space shooter.<br><br>Granted, it still needs work. Enemy bosses are the next thing. A few more weapons (Did you play enough to get the Electron Displacer power up? It rocks!), different explosion variations and other tweaks. I've just added auto-identification so it automatically targets and identifies the nearest enemy to you.<br><br>Yes. I did the particle effecs myself. To create the smoke effect, I gave each particle a timer. When the timer reaches about 50% I fade the colour to dark gray (32,32,32), increase the scale each round and fade it out.<br><br>I also get problems with the planet glow in 32 bit mode but not in 16 bit mode. I thought it was a problem with my inferior hardware. Now, I know it's not I'll spend some time on that. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Pressing 'U' to identify and highlight the nearest enemy helps considerably - if this highlighting happened automatically (eg at the start of a mission; shifting the highlight to the next enemy when the current enemy is destoryed, etc) it would make things better, in my opinion. <br><br>You might want to consider the "Wing Commander" targeting method, whereby enemies in the vicinity are highlighted by 'brackets' and the targeted enemy is highlighted by a 'box'.<br><br>Like other people, I am experiencing planet 'flickering' in the 32 bit modes.<br><br>Another thing: Perhaps it's just me, but I found the opening transcript difficult to read because of the moving background. This could possibly be rectified by having a darker coloured box behind each text portion instead of complete transparency - but you would probably lose the effect you were aiming for. Not having the general's comments and the captain's comments both aligned to the same side of the screen also proved difficult for me.<br><br>I experienced a MAV after leaving the game running (at the opening menu) for a considerable time. <br><br>Despite these things, the game is shaping up well. You have achieved a lot from your obviously considerable efforts. If I were you I would finish and release this space-combat-oriented version and then, for the next version, add the intergalactic trading components you had originally planned to include.<br><br>My system - Laptop: Pentium-M 1600, 512MB DDR2 RAM, 128MB ATI Mobility Radeon X700 <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Not as positive as I was expecting. But, that's a good thing. It's highlighted issues which definately need addressing.<br><br>I have now added auto identify (not in the current download) which automatically highlights the closest enemy when they spawn and when the current enemy is destroyed and I have to admit it makes the game play faster and more continuous. I have started on an interface to allow players to change options mid game (inverting the mouse has been in the back of my mind for some time).<br><br>About the transcript being hard to read. You are so right. Every time I play it I think to myself, "Oh, I gotta do something about that," but then something more important crops up. So, thanks for the comment on that.<br><br>On to the problem with the planet. I am having real probs with this. The planet is a 512x512 sprite. I didn't want to use a mesh because it seemed like wasted polys. The planet glow is the same size sprite scaled x 1.12 and positioned behind the planet. I have tried playing around with entity order and different flags but no luck. If I mask the planet glow (flag 4) it doesn't flicker but I loose the smooth fading at the edges. Can anyone offer suggestions on this?<br><br>Thanks for the comments. I hope more people have opinions to offer. This game will get finished. I guess to sell a game you need to give people what they want.
