Is that a movie?<br>3) Title screen is neat the way it flies around like Unreal and has atmospheric music.  The smoke from the first set of vents seems to be clipped a bit (unatural straight edge) when it first appears on the vents.<br>4) music doesn't pause when I alt+tabbed game to write this.<br>5) wow tons of options.  Regarding texture copy mode, Advanced was 200+ and Normal was 30ish does that mean normal is the faster one (perhaps it should say "faster=lower number" in the text?)  I selected Normal.<br>6) I changed reload to R and duck toggle to C (for Crouch)<br>7) nice loading screen and cool B+W movie.<br>8) Wah, all those controls were described and I didn't take it all in.  Luckily I look at the controls on the title page options before playing and can remember them a bit.<br>9) So right mouse button examines, then you are given a choice and have to press Left Ctrl for yes?  That's just weird.  this needs to be simplified.  I've no idea what No is.<br>10) I figured out that Alt brings up some kinda stats screen but the menu buttons are hard to read and there is no mouse cursor.  I can't figure out how to control this screen.  OK I figured it out now W and S go up and down but enter doesn't select, left mouse does.  It's cool the way you can scroll the file image up and down.  But maybe just make a mouse cursor on this screen for button clicks and have click n drag on the file to view it or some arrow buttons/scrollbar on the side of the file to view.  It's not intuitive.<br>11) Phew finally input the computer code.  Took ages to get right. It's also quite hard to remember a password in two cases and then fiddle with the controls to get the computer ready for input.<br>12) By the way the spelling should be "the system does not respond".<br>13) no icon on Alt+Tab task swapper window.<br>14) nice lasers<br>15) love the outdoor bits through the window even if the sea does look a bit weird<br>16) got to the place where there were 3 "things" on the wall and one has fallen off.  I looked behind me and saw a darkish area but can see the back OK, but as I walk into it it becomes DARKER and I can't see anything, weird as from a distance I can see it all.<br>17) nearly gave up then realised I had to crouch and open the locked under the computer.<br>18) I looked for the nightvision goggles under the items menu but discovered them on the weapons menu, weird.  Ah OK, after equiping it you press Q to use it.  I had to examine the options screen key config to find that out.  <br>19) Escape should really call up the in-game menu - it's standard.<br>20) ok got some kind notification using the goggle salso found agrating that I can't get into.  You can't jump can you? Now I'm stuck.<br>21) I went to exit via the player stats screen and again was present with some weird cryptic menu with key controls instead of mouse.<br><br>The game has some great atmosphere and graphics and seems very professional.  I think the demo is too hard.  I'm no stranger to FPS games or adventure games but I think it should be easy so people want MORE and buy it.  Also the controls do put me off, they need a rethink.<br><br>Good luck with this game, it's an amazing feat! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That seems like something I could click on, a yes button and a no button.<br><br>I got fed up of trying to memorize numbers from a sheet of paper and type them in. It's very neat that you *can* type them in, but - for me - it's a victory for style over substance. I'd rather the game do it for me automatically once I've found the paper and read the codes. This debate has been had before, but I think gamers have become lazy ( I know I have! ) and they/we don't accept the kind of struggles and puzzles we used to accept. Without meaning to trivialize the condition, I'm wondering what a dyslexic would make of this puzzle.

Don't forget about making escape bring up in-game menu instead of F1.  I also recommend you use C for Crouch and R for Reload like numerous FPS games.<br><br>Basically you want your demo to be easy to play (easy controls) and not difficult puzzle so the player can explore more than 2 rooms and a cooridor before giving up.  They need to feel "rewarded" so I'd make it REALLY easy for at least 30 minutes then start getting a bit harder but not tooo hard.  After all you want people to buy the game and they WON'T if they get stuck in the demo, they must be able to FINISH it, and not many of us could.  Hope this helps.<br><br>Another thing, the Activate item key was a bit awkward too, are there many such items as googles?  If no, could they just not have a key like N for Night vision and F for Flashlight (again common keys).<br><br>I noticed you have space for cycle weapons, will the number keys along the top be used to select a specific weapon (doom style), they should be.  You could even put Nightvision on a number like 0, and have in the item display (press 0 to active).<br><br>In fact where you say press the Activate Key or the Blah key, you don't actully say what it is (I know the player may have redefined them), so why not display the actually key? eg. Press the activate key &lt;Q&gt; .  Then there's no going "what the hell key is activate?" why I, and I'm sure many others did.<br><br>Also it would be good if the item menu was ALSO accessible from the Escape (f1) Menu because if you haven't read the instructions you won't know what the item key is (Alt is obscure, I for Inventory may be better), so being able to access it from the Escape menu would be very useful for those people.  You could even show the shortcut key (&lt;I&gt; or &lt;Alt&gt;) next to it so they know there is a shortcut next time.<br><br>OR add a tutorial which describes which key to press (more than once so it drums it in).  You had something like this I think but it didn't show the ACTUAL keys if I recall.<br><br>Hope all this helps, it REALLY will improve the game useability.  Waht's the point in spending so long on an amazing game if people never really get to see more than a couple of rooms? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I am having a blast trying to get through the demo. I am reminded of when I played System Shock II - loving the tension and excitement of hearing the enemies coming when you are just trying to find a safe spot to get your thoughts together and to go over the stuff you find. Wow.  Throw in some mutilated corpses and blood spattered walls and you could easily shift this into a more nerve wracking horror game.<br><br>I'm not really suggesting you make that change, simply pointing out how close your creation has come to my all time favorite game, System Shock II. Great job!<br><br>I had a few problems with the controls, but because I had already read some of the problems that other players had before playing my transition was not so bad. I simply altered the key bindings to reflect my own personal favored settings and everything went fairly smooth. I had to reference the option menu a couple times, but I don't think there is a game I've ever played where I haven't had to do that a couple times till I was used to it.<br><br>I would suggest that you add in a tool tip for the first time a player comes to a ladder. When I first got to that part I didn't figure out right away what I needed to do. I'd opened the passage but did not see any immediate way to climb into the duct. I moved forward into the wall several times with no effect because you have to be facing slightly up before you will climb. I think I figured it out accidentally. <br><br>So far the cutscenes I have seen are AWESOME - the first 5 times I see them ... is there some way to bypass the cutscenes? Forced cutscenes are the bane of many great games when a player gets to a spot where they are having trouble and die over and over. The wait as the video plays through is actually a huge detractor. I've actually given up on games because I cannot save immediatly after a cutscene and each time I die I have to watch the same thing over and over. I would suggest either allowing bypass by a mousehit or keyhit or simply not showing it again once its been seen by the player (which might be tougher to do without an immediate resave).<br><br>I'm having some real problems getting past the bots. My skill at dispatching them leaves me wounded in every encounter.  Do the bots respawn?  Or if I can survive can I look forward to eventually cleaning out enough of them to get a breather?<br><br>When picking up a weapon for the first time a tooltip on specifics of the weapon would be quite useful. As an example the electric gun - I didn't realize right away that you had to hold the trigger and charge it before using it. I thought that I simply hadn't found the right ammo for it at first.<br><br>That's all I have for now. I keep getting pinned down where the energy rifle is. Looking forward to moving forward in the game and experiencing the rest of the game. AGain, superb job!<br><br>-Rick <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Nothing more frustrating then clearing an area, turning your back and getting attacked from a place that should be clear.<br><br>Maybe you could add in security stations that once the player managed to find and disable (hack or deprogram) would halt robot spawns for an area? Or maybe just the opposite - the player manages to activate security stations to eliminate robots in a given area?<br><br>Either way, the difficulty of the robot spawn is very frustrating.

A better system would be that each tile is pressure sensitive and the player must step on the right combination. When they reach the end they then press the button. If they walked the right pattern then whatever happens next happens - the wrong pattern and they get a zap (strength of zap dependent on diff level).<br><br>This way you would have to be incredibly lucky to guess the code since you see no result until after you've entirely done it. You would have to find the paper to solve the puzzle. And it makes sense because it would be a pattern memorized by the owner that they could easily duplicate yet would prove near impossible to solve by intruders.<br><br>Paolo, that is something to keep in mind. Many players are enjoying your game for the atmosphere that it creates, but we are getting turned off by the aspects of the game that are forcing the player to learn some eye-hand coordination trick. Some people simply cannot play that kind of game because hand-eye stuff is for your younger, faster reflex crowd and most people are just going to lose patience\interest and quit.<br><br>Until the clue was given on here about the hidden ventilation shaft i was stuck. I would suggest you have an odd bit of paper laying around or an innocent computer entry somewhere that was left by a maintenance person that hints at the existence of the cover.  Maybe an email to someone in the facility related to some innocent matter that alludes to the cover - "Cindy, looking forward to getting with you on lunch again to talk about last nights episode of Big Brother 26. I won't be able to stay long because I have to get to Mike's office and fix a broken ventilation panel that a shorted security drone knocked loose."<br><br>I am really really hating the bot spawns. It's that whole spawning in a room I just cleared thing that drives me nuts. Really hoping that the changes coming will improve that problem because that is a huge detractor right now.<br><br>Keep at it Paolo! I hope you don't mistake the comments/complaints as too much criticism. It really is a desire to see a real promising game become a hit. It's quite telling that as frustrating as things are now I still keep going back in to see if I can get a little farther! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I loved the whole beginning of this Demo. Felt like the old style adventure games you used to get in the old days! (and thats a good thing). The mood and presentation is brilliant and of a very high quality. So to the feed back...<br><br>1) Yes the controls take a bit of getting used to I must admit and some refinement would be nice. I've seen it commented on in the above posts and you seem to be taking steps to this end. Thats great.<br><br>2) The re-spawn thing is a problem for this game I believe. I know you're extending the time on how often they respawn and how much damage they do, but I don't think that would do it for me. I think a good harmony would be to have a set number of droids/drones assigned to each level (not huge numbers either). That way the player can eventually 'clear' an area of security bots and at least then be left in peace to figure out what move to do next :) (plus one of the terminals might even tell you how many are left)<br><br>3) The player model (Alexia) could do with some refining, she looks a little too low poly, and given the high quality of the rest of the environment she tends to stand out a bit. (minor quibble really) :)<br><br>Thats about it. I haven't got as far as the Delta Gate puzzle, but it sounds like quite a few people are having problems with it. So that might need looking at. <br><br>Overall a brilliant game and with the changes you've mention you're doing anyway it sounds like it'll be a cult hit :) I'm looking forward to the tweaked version soon.<br><br>Keep up the great work. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
