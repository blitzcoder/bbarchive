So I expect it to be smaller.<br><br><br>The Kays/Controls Are Simple.<br><br>Right Mouse to Thrust in the direction your pointing.<br>Left Mouse to Shoot at your target reticle.<br><br>There are 3 Power ups, Green , Red and Blue.<br>Each have different abilities.<br><br>There are about 10 levels, the level.txt file holds the level data its all in plain text so it should be easy enough  for you to play with it. If you want more info on the way this file is made up just ask.<br><br>Cheat Buttons.<br>1 - Firelevel 1<br>2 &amp; 3 ^^      2,3<br><br>4 - Release a Random Asteroid, erm 9 I think in total each made of a different thing, so you got gold silver lava DarkMatter Iron rock and so on. Each have the amount of strength that you would expect. like Iron is harder to kill than say a Mud Asteroid.<br><br>5 - 6 and 7 As the fire type, Pulse , Magma and Plasma<br><br>Pulse Fire is low in damage and scatters about a lot.<br>Magma is stronger than pulse but is more focused.<br>Plasma is Spread out and does the most damage.<br><br>the guns are a little un balanced at the moment, but im working on it, so any ideas about them would be good.<br><br>Erm trying to think if I have left anything out, that you really need to know.<br><br>Oh well.

Im only concerned about a few gameplay issues..<br><br>one thing is the mouse control.. when you fly across the screen, while fireing at a celestial body (^^), you sometimes cross the border and shifts to the other side of the screen.. this is normal, however the aiming ensures that you don't need to aim, you just hold your mouse where you used to and you will continue to shoot at the object.. this is one thing that deducts a great amount of gameplay in my opinion.<br><br>and it lacked a certain... incentive? is that even a word? ^^ I played through the 10 levels, but I only did it to test it, and wouldn't have bothered just for the "fun" factor.. so you need to put something in there somewhere.. sorry I am so vague, but I really don't know what it would be..<br><br>Oh yeah, it was smoooooooth and looked very nice btw ^^ <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Im looking for other ways than the ones Iv said above to improve the gameplay. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So any impact will reduce your shielding . so if you have full shield when you hit it, you will then be able to take 3 rapid hits from small roids and it will kill you, instead of your shield protecting you for a few seconds.<br><br>thanks for the feedback guys.<br><br>So I think next thing I'm going to do then is work on the weapons and try and give them more balance and then addin some new powerup type guns and stuff. like suggested. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I love astronomy and i have seen all of those pictures a thousand times, so i am also not sure about the rights you have to put them in your game. However, it is very possible that it's ok. Otherwise the pictures are really blurred. You can find higher resolution images on sites such as www.space.com maybe? There are many galeries online.<br><br>Like in "Star Raider" you have all your files in normal folders. Why dont you pack them somewhere so not everyone can see them and modify them, etc. Just looks more professional at least.<br><br>Otherwise really nice stuff. I like the way the mouse movement is solved, and i personally find your version of "asteroids" the most fun i have ever played :) meaning i like the gameplay. BUT, because it is easier to shoot things, make the levels harder where for example sometimes you start a level with MAAANY smallest asteroids and you have to focus on flying and avoiding them. <br><br>Also i believe you could add your own touches such as that "docking" feature or for example you could add an asteroid that is moving irregularily, like dodging bullets or moving up down left and right randomly. This would be a good panic factor because you would have to stay away from such a crazy asteroid you never know which way it would hit. And make it harder to split as well! Hope you like that idea :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'm probably wrong though, Your also right about seeing them all over the place, since I stuck them in iv seen them in add's mag's tv and a film.<br><br>TBH though I cant see Nasa chasin me down for using a picture taken from hubble for a game.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Warning I'm going to go OFF-TOPIC here and dont really want this thread bogged down with this off-topic stuff. I just feel strong enough about this that I have to reply to it.<br><br><div class="quote"> Like in "Star Raider" you have all your files in normal folders. Why dont you pack them somewhere so not everyone can see them and modify them <br></div><br><br>In Short no. I hate games that tuck files away, I think its bad Design and bad planning. One look at the games community today will show you that ppl like to mess with games, they like to make their own levels, insert their oen sound files and add their own backgrounds.<br><br>Your thoughts about it looking more pro by tucking things away is false as well. in fact the top 5 best selling games on the market today in any field, all have their media in folders, so that its easy for their community to mod tha game.<br><br>MODing is here to stay, like it or not, So I think a lot of people are going to have to chose to open up their games and let them be moded, which will build community and get it played more, or close the games down and limit the amount of fun ppl have with them.<br><br>Dont get me wrong, if its core to the game, like saved ini data or saved files that cant be touched then by all means hide them away, but if not just leave them out to be edited. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
