The only requirement you will devote 30 seconds to download a free access code that will give you all day to play. <br>- The game is entirely in 3D, both scenarios as their ships. You have a good number of ships, each with its own characteristics (speed, power, ability to coat, heavy ammunition capacity, ...). Plus you'll be improving the equipment of your ships with bonus points. You can improve your lasers, missiles and achieve different droids to help you in the game. Each ship will have different levels of evolution to be activated with items during the games. <br>- Your scores will be accumulated in a World Ranking will be divided into 4 parts: the best scores of a game, the best overall scores accumulated from the first day you play Arkhelom 3D, players have more medals and ultimately the players more days have played the game. <br>- The concept of Arkhelom game is unlike many other games of this type. You can play the levels in the order you prefer. By completing a level you can choose yourself the next level where you will play. The game's difficulty will be increased as you play, so save your game score the maximum level of difficulty you have achieved are reflected in the world ranking, and the ship model with which you played. <br>- Every day you play you get bonus points. Each time you exceed your own records or every day you stay at the top of any of the 4 world rankings get a medal and extra bonus points. During the game items will also give you bonus points. With these bonus points you can improve the characteristics of each of your ships (lasers, missiles and droids). <br>- As usual in such games, items will appear that will enhance the features of the ship during the game, improving the speed, frequency and power of your lasers, ammunition and power of your missiles, raise your shield, points bonus and others. <br>- Periodically on the website will create new free content, such as new ships of different features, new levels downloadable, music, audio effects and new versions of the game engine to improve its playability. <br>- Users can make suggestions to improve the game and its updates, report bugs and even play the game by creating new ships that will join the game. <br><br>DOWNLOAD VIDEO HERE: <a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=U5HH9BUQ" target="_blank">Click here!</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
