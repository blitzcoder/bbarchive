It's being re-written from scratch primarily to take advantage of a multi-platform release on Windows, Mac and Linux.  I've also taken this opportunity to vastly improve the look and mechanics of the game.<br><br>Rockfall, as it's name suggests, can be likened to Boulderdash, although it's actionally based around the Repton series of games that were released for the BBC/Electron computers of the early 1980s.  It's basically a "collect the gems while avoiding falling boulders and other nasties" game.<br><br><b>Screenshot</b><br><br><img src="http://www.sos-software.co.uk/assets/screens/full/r4dx/r4dx_1.jpg"><br><br>You can click <a href="http://www.sos-software.co.uk/home/newsScr.html" target="_blank">here</a> for some more screenshots.<br><br><b>Changes</b><br><br>- Graphics have been tidied up along with a brand new main font.<br><br>- There are now seven tunes by Achim Tober included (Achim, if you're reading this, is it OK for me to use seven tunes in one title?  I don't want to take liberties).  These may not be the final tunes, but I would like feedback on whether you think they fit with the game.<br><br>- If you have more than 512MB of RAM you can have all the music load at start up, which gives you the option of having each tune loop per level, or have them play one after the other regardless of level.<br><br>- A couple of the more annoying sound effects have been changed (particularly the ding sound of the gems).<br><br>- The high score table now saves your scores.<br><br>- The end-sequence is now in.<br><br>- Display detection has been tweaked so it should more accurately choose a suitable resolution for your display.<br><br>- A bug has been fixed where a profile would get over-written with the default settings should the game get launched from another user account after already being run once in a different account.<br><br>- Windows: All save data is now in the Common Applications Folder instead of Program Files.<br><br>- Windows: The installer now associates the level files with the game and assigns them an icon.  This is to allow a user to easily import a third-party level set later (since game data is now in a hidden folder).  A user simply extracts a downloaded file to a place of their choosing and double-clicks the file.  The game launches and makes a copy in the Common Applications Folder.  They will later be able to export any level files to the My Documents folder from within the level editor (which is yet to be written).<br><br>- Windows: The default audio driver should be FreeAudio for XP and OpenAL Generic Software for Vista.<br><br>- MacOS: All game media and initial game data is stored within the application bundle, so Universal Binaries are not twice the size they should be!<br><br>- MacOS: Game data is stored in the Users/Shared folder, so it can be run from any user account.<br><br>- Linux: Game data is stored in the current user's home or Documents folder.  There is no shared folder that I am aware of.  Someone correct me if I'm wrong.<br><br><b>Other info</b><br><br>The level set that comes with this download is an imported set from Rockfall 3 that was originally going to be released for the Atari ST.  It contains 30 levels that start easy enough, but will soon get quite hard.  The reason for this is that the set was never finished, as it was meant to contain around 100 levels.  The final game will feature a set based on the current PC set of 71 levels, but will be tweaked and extended to give a full complement of 100 levels.  The final game will also include ported sets from Rockfall's 1 to 3.  This will mean a grand total of 225 levels with the finished game!<br><br>Things to do are the level editor, tutorial levels, completing the final level set, and making changes to the levels from Rockfall's 1 to 3.  I want to modify them so that people that have played them in the past can still have some fun with them.<br><br><b>Downloads</b><br><br><a href="http://www.sos-software.co.uk/misc/r4dx_test_setup.exe" target="_blank">Windows installer (20.5MB)</a><br><br><a href="http://www.sos-software.co.uk/misc/r4dx_test.dmg" target="_blank">Mac OS Universal Binary (21.1MB, DMG)</a><br><br><a href="http://www.sos-software.co.uk/misc/r4dx_test.tar.gz" target="_blank">Linux (19.7MB, TAR.GZ)</a><br><br><b>Controls</b><br><br>Move - Cursor keys<br>Map - Space<br>Commit suicide - Q<br>Tab - Hide/show HUD<br>Pause - Esc<br><br>All reconfigurable under the Preferences menu.<br><br><b>Feedback</b><br><br>What I'd like from you guys is any constructive feedback you can give me about the game in general and whether you think there's anything I could improve.<br><br>More importantly, it would be useful to know what system specs you have and whether the game ran without any problems.  If there were problems or bugs I'd really appreciate knowing about them and whether there is any way that they can easily be reproduced.<br><br>There is one known issue on Linux in that if the game is played full-screen, the desktop deosn't refresh itself when the game is exited (this is more a BlitzMax issue unfortunately).  Also, the Combiz effects can mess up the refresh rate in full-screen as well, so it's best to turn these effects off if you have them.<br><br>Pressing F11 at any time will reveal some debug information.<br><br>Apart from that, everything should be working as it should ... fingers crossed!<br><br>OK, I've waffled on for quite a while now, so please download and let me know what you think, along with any issues or recommendations you may have.<br><br>Have fun. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You then end up losing two lives instead of just one.<br><br>This is why the auto-play feature is there.  After dying the game replays your last life.  You can quickly get back to where you were by speeding up this replay with the 1, 2 or 3 keys.

However, this may be rectified for the final version as I've had a good offer from someone to re-do them.  As for particle effects, I really don't think they're necessary in every game.  Having said that, I'll consider adding something.  Just not sure what at the moment.<br><br><div class="quote"> The puzzle element is good though, if very frustrating <br></div><br>Glad you like the puzzle element, as this is something I always thought that Repton was better at than Boulderdash.

Just trying to be one of the better versions out there.  There are hundreds of Boulderdash clones out there, but not so many Repton ones.  Although they look very similar, they play differently, and I much prefer Repton to Boulderdash.  The very first Rockfall was written because I didn't get on with Boulderdash on the Atari ST.  There are a couple of original gameplay elements (when compared to Repton), but I'm saving massive gameplay enhancements for the sequel in a couple of years time.<br><br><div class="quote"> That said it does have potential <br></div><br>Thanks.
