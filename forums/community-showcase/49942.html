I'm really quite taken back at how positive you guys are being. To me this had always been just a wee project to learn the ropes (you know, timing and stuff).<br><br><div class="quote"> Firstly, I hated the music. <br></div><br>Fair enough. In keeping with my whole philosophy for this project (keep it simple and don't get bogged down in any one thing) I spent about an hour tops on each tune. Tried to go for a kind of retro vibe - guess it's not for everyone  :-)<br><br><div class="quote"> Secondly, I was useless at it. I know the second fault isn't actually the games fault - but I like playing well put together freeware games and this is one of them ... but i'm just hopeless. I got to wave 3. <br></div><br>I've actually been quite worried that the game was too easy. Are you using keys, mouse or joystick? I tend to find it a lot easier with the mouse, but then I've been playing it for the last 8 months or so.<br><br><div class="quote"> The explosions are extremely well done and shows a grasp of game composition that most of our peers don't get for a considerable number of incomplete projects ... that special effects only become special when used in tandem with more effects. So well done for that, the explosions where very nice. <br></div><br>Again, thanks. I was quite chuffed with them when I first got it all working together  :-)<br><br><div class="quote"> The enemies looked like they'd come strait out of a Binary Zoo game but they worked well, the glow made the primitive shapes work which must have saved you a load of development time compared to the rest of us on our early attempts slaving over our pixel art! You smug little... ! :) <br></div><br>Yeah, the whole idea was to make them as simple as possible to create while still looking nice. Most of my previous attempts at games have failed very early on (usually before any gameplay is in place) because I would spend ages on the art and eventually get bored. This time I make the conscious effort to ignore the art until the gameplay was nearly complete (it was <i>really</i> abstract for the first 3 months) and then keep the art as simple as possible.<br><br><div class="quote"> If you where to ask me how to improve on the game and I needed to find an answer, i'd suggest maybe making the whole thing move along a bit faster to increase the adrenaline hit. <br></div><br>Things do get moving as the game goes on - remember you've only played the first 3 of 50 levels  :-)<br><br><div class="quote"> I loved the asteroid field <br></div><br>That really just came out of the way I was creating and handling the enemies. Arkanoid? Not sure if that'd be possible with the setup I have ... maybe ... I'll have a think about it.<br><br><div class="quote"> music was OK but you need much higher quality instruments playing it <br></div><br>Yeah, they're just simple mod tracks that I threw together to get something in there. I might rethink that approach if people continue to dislike it so much  :-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

And, yes, the aliens start off slow, but do ramp up throughout the game - I didn't want to start things off too fast for fear of putting people off. Guess you can't please everyone  :-)<br><br>Should maybe also point out that in the final game, once you've beaten a boss (every 10 levels) you'll be able to start at that point in the future, thus avoiding the slower early levels.

I've been an avid shmup fan for a while, and i've grown to appreciate the nuances of these sort of games.<br><br>I like the graphics. The simple shapes are effective, and the glows give enough eye-candy for the more graphically-dependant among us to enjoy. I like the color schemes, as theres never any question of what is friend and what is foe. Also of note are the clean menus. Easy to navigate, fast, and attractive.<br><br>I personally enjoyed the music. I enjoy that retro sound, and remember when .mod and .s3m files were all the rage :). Though it can get a little repetitive.<br><br>I think the pacing is good. In fact, im somewhat opposed to the idea of increased speed. In its current state, you have time and agility enough to weave between bullets.<br><br>The weapon fire mode toggle and special abilities are a really nice touch. For the most part, shmup's only allow one-time choosing of fire modes (usually beam and spread), and only offer a 'bomb' special. Kudos on giving players a choice, it adds a lot to the tactical variety of the game.<br><br>I only had time enough to play through the first 4 waves (and I was STILL late for work *grumble*), but i'm looking forward to going at it again.

Polished all round.  I think the music is fine, at least it is good quality (if not to everyones taste which is probably impossible anyway).  One idea, you could make the enemies flash when they are hit but not destroyed, you aready have a little lazer exploding thing but maybe there could be more.  There are so many enemy bullets on scren it reminds me of that weird Japanese Nintedo Gamecube game Ikaruga.<br><br>Are you going to sell it?  You should do as I am working on a similar thing for fun and have played quite a few others as research and yours is the best yet by far.  In fact it make's mine look poopy (mind you it's early days yet).  If you are interested take a look at <a href="http://www.jbcomputersolutions.com/tetroid/shoot03.zip" target="_blank">http://www.jbcomputersolutions.com/tetroid/shoot03.zip</a>  It's done in BlitzPlus and uses the same keys as yours + use A to summon more aliens and 1 to 9 to increase number of bullets.  Mine isn't even a demo, just a very early WIP, but you'll get the idea. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
