I kept activating nearby consoles when in transfer mode by accident - needs a hold-down delay before activating the console.

My feedback :-<br><br>1. Agree with Vorderman on his point 2.  <br><br>2. Would it be possible to stick an option in there to merge the two buttons.  If held down then xfer mode engaged, other wise shoot.  If xfer mode engaged over lift or next to console then activate lift or console, etc.<br><br>3. When you shoot the standard lazers, there is no animation on them which looks a little like they are stuck on to the rest of a very animated and fluid scene.  Can you stick a second frame of anim on the lazers or make them flicker or something? <br><br>4. Xfer mode, when engaging, can you make it so that the fire key skips the "this is you", "this is them" screens quicker :).<br><br>5. Xfer game: Nearly died first time round because I thought I was yellow (which was on the left in the original) which is now on the right, not a problem now I got used ;) <br><br>Other than these VERY small things, I think you have done an absolutley STERLING job of remaking this game.  I will be playing again without doubt and look forward to any updates you happen to do.  <br><br>Well done.<br><br>A <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Ive just played it for ages and got no.2 on the Online scores EAT MY ELECTRODES DUDES!  Got to the VERY LAST droid on level 2 who got in a lucky shot, bah!<br><br>Some points I like to raise/ask:<br><br>1) How they hell do you know what your energy level is, I can never tell until I'm nearly dead so I just keep sitting on those recharge things and taking over droids. A cool idea may be to have the droid spin slower and slower as they loose energy, or maybe faster to indicate panic!<br>2) Some levels like E, M and N, don't dim when you kill the last droid: the Dim noise IS played though.  But if you exit and go back they are dim. <br>3) Sometimes the droids don't bash, they go over one another, is this intentional?<br>4) sometimes the lasers (double esp.) seems to have dodgy collision detection.<br>5) Have you fixed the refresh rate to 60Hz or something because it is very smooth i.e. no delta timing or whatever?  This may be why some people with VSync Off are getting too fast a game. <br>6) What reduces your power, baning into droids doesn't seem to.  Walking round? Firing? Getting hit.  Never could figure this out<br>7) If you overtake a droid you previously damaged will it be partially damaged once you win it?<br>8) Escape doesn't bring up an in-game menu it quites without any warning OH MY GOD, this is a bummer as you can only "pause" on the computer consoles or lifts.<br>9) Some weapons seem ineffectual against some droids so you have to change droid.  Can you tell by looking at a droid or not?<br>10) An 800 series droid was moving right across a green light square that was solid and I couldn't pass through.<br>11) Please add a save game in.  If you don't want it too easy, add it in after every level, but this would be too hard!<br>12) How many ships (levels) are there?<br>13) Done any other games? (Guess I should just look at your website)<br>14) How long did it take?  Any idea in manhours?<br><br>Sorry for all the questions/feedback but I thought it was great and wanted to show my appreciation by helping ou, plus I just HAVE to know stuff ;-)<br><br>Blitztastic: Yeah, nebulus was cool.<br><br>Also a very simialr game to this that was great was Ranarama! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

We feel that it was one of the positive points from the original and kept that in.  You got to admit you start to panic when your little droid starts to flash red.<br><br><br>2) Some decks don't darken once empty of droids, which is confusing when you're searching out the last few populated decks.<br><br>there are 4 levels that have 2 parts to them.  By looking at the deck levels you see the adjacent level that has to be cleared to complete that deck.<br><br><br>3) Sometimes the droids don't bash, they go over one another, is this intentional?<br><br>yes, its when robots have no other place to go - rather than have them pause and wait for a route.  This was prefered to them constantly bashing into you and quickly killing you.<br><br>4) sometimes the lasers (double esp.) seems to have dodgy collision detection.<br><br>Hot spots are about the middle of each droid. <br><br>5) Have you fixed the refresh rate to 60Hz or something because it is very smooth i.e. no delta timing or whatever? This may be why some people with VSync Off are getting too fast a game.<br><br>Yes its fixed at the monitor refresh rate (hence smooth scrolling).  If people have turned their vsync off then yes the game will fly and become unplayable. - I suggest they turn it back on if they want to play.<br><br><br><br>6) What reduces your power, baning into droids doesn't seem to. Walking round? Firing? Getting hit. Never could figure this out<br><br>a) Power is drained over time.  The higher your droid the faster the drain.  <br>b) Bumping into other droids reduces your energy (but minimal)<br>c)Being shot.<br><br>7) If you overtake a droid you previously damaged will it be partially damaged once you win it?<br><br>yes <br><br>8) Escape doesn't bring up an in-game menu it quites without any warning OH MY GOD, this is a bummer as you can only "pause" on the computer consoles or lifts.<br><br>I can put it on the suggestion list (inclusion of a pause button)<br><br>9) Some weapons seem ineffectual against some droids so you have to change droid. Can you tell by looking at a droid or not?<br><br>It all depends on which class of robot you have and their class of lazer (single, double, red).  The class of droid is the first digit of the robot ID.<br><br>A level 1 droid will do no damage to a 7 series, minimal damage to a 6.   Its all based on an equation (ripped from the original)<br><br>10) An 800 series droid was moving right across a green light square that was solid and I couldn't pass through.<br><br>Sounds like a bug to me...  or I could say a feature :)<br><br>11) Please add a save game in. If you don't want it too easy, add it in after every level, but this would be too hard!<br><br>Never gonna happen :) - technically very easy but makes the game far too easy.  <br><br>12) How many ships (levels) are there?<br><br>20 levels, 1 ship with increasingly harder levels (the class of droids changes, rate of enemy first etc)<br><br>13) Done any other games? (Guess I should just look at your website)<br><br>Lots and all free.  Check out <a href="http://www.ovine.net" target="_blank">http://www.ovine.net</a> <br><br>14) How long did it take? Any idea in manhours?<br><br>This was a quickie, including testing Id say about 40 hours.  I coulnt say how long the GFX took.<br><br>15) Would it be possible to stick an option in there to merge the two buttons. If held down then xfer mode engaged, other wise shoot. If xfer mode engaged over lift or next to console then activate lift or console, etc.<br><br>We had got the original single button method.  It was only a couple of days ago that it was changed to 2 button.  I'll put it to the other guys to see what they think.  The only reason Mr Braybrook originally did a single button is that the C64 joystick only had 1 button.<br><br><br>16) When you shoot the standard lazers, there is no animation on them which looks a little like they are stuck on to the rest of a very animated and fluid scene. Can you stick a second frame of anim on the lazers or make them flicker or something?<br><br>Im happy with how they are, but can see what the GFX guy thinks.<br><br>17) Xfer mode, when engaging, can you make it so that the fire key skips the "this is you", "this is them" screens quicker :).<br><br>You will find the action or fire button progresses past the screens.<br><br><br>18) Xfer game: Nearly died first time round because I thought I was yellow (which was on the left in the original) which is now on the right, not a problem now I got used ;)<br><br>:)<br><br>19) transfer mode takes too long to engage - often I was dodging shots like mad waiting for the mode to engage, then it suddenly did just as I bumped into a lower class robot.

I bought a Spec at 8 cos I knew no better. I WAS good but one day it broke.  By then I'd seen the C64 so I bought one of those cos it was clearly better in a number of ways, like having it's own tape recorder for a start!  Then one day I saw an Amiga.  When I could talk and think again, I knew I had to have one.  But being sensible a friend and I check out Amiga 500 and ST 520 specs together.  ALL the specs showed the Aimga to be better so I got one and it ROCKED.  Later on got a 1200.  My friend had an ST and it was OK, but at the end of the day, you could spot ST ported games a mile off.  The only thing STs were good for was running Cubase and having a midi port.  Were still used years later for that function.<br><br>mrTricks: Yep I played Quazatron on the spec too, it was great. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I've read some of their attempts and they just don't compare - very lightweight and lacking detail. For example the Gibbage diary in PCZone - excellent idea, but it should be 3 or 4 pages and packed with screenshots and techie stuff, not just a vague 1 page overview. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
