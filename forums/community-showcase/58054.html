<table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr ><td class="posthead"><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr ><td >ArcadEd</td><td align="right"><font class=tiny>(Posted 2006)</font>&nbsp;<a href="#1">[#1]</a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr ><td class="posttext"> Arcade-In-A-Box Game's website is now live for developers to start registering.<br><br>www.aiabgames.com<br><br>(If you want to see a demo of the dev portal, just log in as ArcadEd/reztro)<br>(If you want to see the store visit www.aiabgames.com/cre  it's just not active yet, but there are few demo products to show)<br><br>Here is a copy and paste of our current FAQ, hopefully it will answer some questions.  If not, I'll be checking back here very often to help address any questions.<br><br>What is AIAB Games? <br><br>AIAB Games is a division of Arcade-In-A-Box, LLC. We are dedicated to finding talented independent game developers that have a desire to create arcade style games, and give them an outlet to sell their games. Our sole business is not to make profits off selling software. Our main business is manufacturing high quality arcade controllers and consoles. However, we do see opportunity to utilize these great games to help sell our units, while promoting your games in return. It?s a win both sides. <br>   <br><br>What do I need to do to make my games available at AIAB Games? <br><br>First, you will want to download the AIAB Technical Specifications Sheet. This document will give you a good idea of how to program games for this platform. If it is something you are interested in, then register for an account here. There are no setup fees, so registration is free. Once you have registered you can then login to the developer area. From there you can add games to the database, edit games, view stats, etc. <br>   <br><br>What does AIAB Game get out of this? <br><br>AIAB Games takes a 12% percent commission from each sale (10% +2% for credit card processing if a credit card is used.). The rest of the money you sell the game for is yours. The only exception to that is if you want to be paid via paypal, there is a small funds transfer fee. We make payments the 1st of every month. <br>  <br> <br>What is the process of adding a game? <br><br>Once you have a final version of your game, login to your AIAB Games account to get to the Developer Portal. From their you will click the add game button and fill out the information. Once that is complete, you will get an email with the information to an ftp site to upload your game too. At this point, AIAB will test the game on an arcade system to make sure 1. It?s compatible and 2. There are no game killing bugs. Once 1 and 2 are cleared, the game is packaged in 3 ways. 1. Arcade Cabinet (MAME Compliant), 2. Arcade-In-A-Box, and 3. PC Compliant. Then it?s added to the store for download. <br>   <br><br>How good does my game have to be? <br><br>Over the years of playing video games, we have learned one thing; everyone has a different taste in what is fun. With that said, we will not judge your game. As long as it meets the technical requirements and is not buggy, it will be added to the store. Now whether it sells may determine how good it is. But, it won?t cost you anything to have it in our store. However, we do reserve the rights to remove any game from the store that is not selling if we become short of space <br><br><br>After registering you will have access to the Developer Portal.  Hopefully we can build a nice downloads section to help other developers with their projects.<br><br>I hope to open the store May 1st, but if we have enough games before then I'll open it earlier.  It would be great to have at least 5 games available when the store opens.<br><br>Thanks again for all the hard work you put into you games. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I just dumped my Plasmorg project, so expect a whole new game to come about when it's time.  I'll register now, but the new game project of mine won't be released until it's on a "When It's Done" basis (now that sounds familiar).  I just got done with the graphics and sound media, now to make this game work, that's another thing.  Expect my "TumBlocks" project in, well, may take at least a couple of months to perfect the thing for this AIAB of yours.<br><br>On top of that, my first version will be based around an X360 controller, so you may not get the Arcade version until late spring, early summer at least... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If I start maxing out my bandwidth and storage space, that might change.   But everyone that has been on board since the start will be grandfathered in regardless. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

What I mean by "hybrid" is clashing two different games together, use my imagination, and creating my own little niche in how to use one game, and combine it with another, like the one I'm doing now.  Having that in an arcade cabinet would be ideal.  That would sell, having two classic iconic games wrapped into one, and a whole new setting, that should work out well.  Thanks Buggy, and I'll see what transpires with my game project.  I'm going to develop my game around my X360 controller first, just to see how it plays.  Then I'll create a separate version of the game for the arcade cabinet after the fact using the keyboard controls.  BTW, here's how the controls should work on the X360 controller (if anyone wants to convert this from Blitz 3D to BlitzMax for porting into a console, be my guest, because it is really a 2D game with 3D graphics (I would've made it 3D, but it just wouldn't feel right)):<br><br><img src="http://img90.imageshack.us/img90/8065/controls2vz.png"> <br><br>Tried to mouse-draw the game controller, but of course, my Wacom tablet couldn't fit the controller on it (it's only the 4x5 model, and maybe would've needed the 6x8 Wacom in order for the controller to fit), so I had to draw the controller the hard way, not easy.  However, you get the idea of how this game's gonna be programmed... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Whether you would want to port a BMax game into a game console (since XBox uses Linux code), I'm sort of wondering if that Open Source XDK will be friendly enough for you to put some games in the Live Arcade.  <br><br>My guess, out of research on BMax with Linux, it seems like this would be an up and coming community for Arcade-based games.  Just as long as there are drivers for the X360 or the XBox controller designed for Linux, I don't see this as being a problem... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
