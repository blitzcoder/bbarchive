That's crazy talk! :-)  <br><br>His tool doesn't correct lighting across the image, or allow you to remove perspective from the image.  When blending, it only does a simple alpha blend with noise.  The maximum size of the source image is limited by your screen resolution.  There is no load dialog, no save dialog.  No ability to modify the size of the output texture. No abiltiy to change the radius of the area blended.<br><br>No offense intended to Rob here.  There's a reason it took me six weeks to write my program!  <br><br>(I spent two weeks on the algorithms alone, and the interface has taken me a firther four weeks so far.)  <br><br>The idea that you wasted your money on my tool because Rob's tool now exists is silly!  It's not like Rob here has developed the first free seamless texture tool.  My tool exists, not because no other tools like it exist, but because it does a better job than the other tools.  Including Rob's here.  <br><br>That's why you should be happy you bought it... Because your textures will tend to come out looking great, even if you're not a good at making art. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I liked the idea of using noise to influence the alpha map to make it look better, even if that wouldn't work well in all instances, and I like the idea of blending areas outside the texture into the other side of the texture.  It seems more intuitive than the "stretch" methods of blending which do something similar. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
