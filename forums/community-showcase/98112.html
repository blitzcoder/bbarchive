Below is a link to my viewer app on Dropbox if anyone wants to try it out. It mostly works now, though there’s more to do. <br><br>Would love to know features you GMs and players out there might find useful. This is just a fun project for me to do, not a business or anything, but I'll certainly consider your suggestions!<br><br><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8988232/TSV.zip" target="_blank">download</a><br><br>Download, unzip, and double-click TSV.exe to run the app. Roll over the “Menu” tab at the bottom of the screen to open the menu. The “Load” button will open up a little dialog requesting the name of the sector to open. The “Options” button does nothing for now. “Exit” will close the program, as advertised. The buttons to the right are view toggles, they don’t do anything unless you’ve got a subsector loaded.<br><br>If you roll over an object you get a small display noting what it is. If you right-click on a world object, you get data on that world and key features of the system.<br><br>You can move the view around using:<br>W – Forward<br>X – Backward<br>A – Left<br>D – Right<br>Z – Down<br>C – Up<br>Q – Turn left<br>E – Turn right<br>S – Reset camera<br>Up Arrow – Camera pitch up<br>Down Arrow – Camera pitch down<br><br>The controls are hinkey and I’ll improve them at some point before I’m done. Any suggestions for mouse-based camera movement would be appreciated.<br><br>Other keys:<br>Ctrl-R – Toggle display of jump routes<br>Ctrl-A – Toggle display of allegiances<br>Ctrl-Z – Toggle display of travel zones<br>Ctrl-L – Load subsector<br>F1 – Help (not yet implemented)<br>F2 – Credits<br>ESC - End program<br><br>Technical things:<br>Ctrl-W – Toggle wireframe<br>Ctrl-D – Toggle debug display<br><br>Subsectors are stored in text files in the "subsectors" directory. You can probably figure out what's what from looking at the file. If you do play with the files be aware that changing something outside of expected bounds (i.e. changing the "starport" digit of the UPP to something other than A-E) will likely cause strange behavior or even cause the app to crash. There is no strong error-checking at this point.<br><br>Eventually I'll create a generator that will create these files and I may try to create import functionality for popular existing generators if I can figure out what they are...suggestions welcome.<br><br>I should note that there's some 'flicker' on the planets due to the app having trouble figuring out which polygons to render first between planet, water, cloud, and atmosphere layers. Apparently this is a problem with DX7 and the programming tool I chose to use, Blitz 3D, and can't be solved without building in something else...which I may eventually do. <br><br>Feel free to critique...and please let me know if you get any major errors. Thanks!<br>M<br><br>PS: I don't see a way to post images here and I'm not really on any image hosting services. If you want to see some screenshots (some earlier in the development process) you can look over at CG, though you might need to be a member to see them. Here's the thread: <a href="http://www.cartographersguild.com/sh...Map-Grid/page2" target="_blank">link</a><br><br>Here's a screenshot I posted at Citizens of the Imperium:<br><a href="http://www.travellerrpg.com/CotI/Gal.../1_Capture.JPG" target="_blank">link</a><br>Don't know if you can see it without being a member. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

They *are* 3d. There are no sprites. The planets are spheres and the objects you're referring to are cylinders. Any deformation you're seeing is coming from the 3D renderer and perspective.
