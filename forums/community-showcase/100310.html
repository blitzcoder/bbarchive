You think that when we requested help with crowdfunding, people understand that money is run out or is not enough. Simply we express this in the video. Also keep in mind that we have been duped with IFK2 bundle which had 2 our games. Glad you like the curtains! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So take it as you might, but my impression of your campaign is that it has far too many negatives.  "Stung by facekick", "have to use our spare time", "limited funding"... well blah blah, every man and his dog has sob stories.  I felt quite depressed by your video when I should have been left feeling like I wanted to donate.<br><br>On a positive note, I really like your humbleness.  The shot of you in front of two screens with the curtains drawn sums up your indie work ethic really well (it's daytime, too bright for coding so we have to shut the curtains.  We work at home, not in fancy offices funded by some EU grant...) And another positive - you know what you are doing, you are accomplished developers.<br><br>So really, drop all the negativity.  You won't get backers out of sympathy for your plight -- look at the lengths legitimate charities have to go to to raise funds, and shit, they're promising to cure cancer!  Offer people a fun and full-on gaming experience that they can be part of, that's all you have -- so it has be enough.<br><br>Build on the positives:  a great game design, a proven track record, a dedicated team that works flat out, an almost finished game...  I'm sure you can find many more.<br><br>Last but not least, good luck man :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Seriously, you need to hire artists to remodel/re-texture/visually redesign your environments and characters because you can't do it yourself. This is not an insult - you just need to identify your weaknesses (we all have them) and get help from people who have the skills/talents that you lack.<br><br>Fatally, your Tompi character appears poorly designed, poorly modelled and glitchy. And his facial expression is extremely repulsive. I mean, what's with the crazy eyes, Austin Powers teeth and obnoxious sticky-outy tongue? When I look at him, I think, "flasher in the park" rather than "wacky, fun-loving chap".<br><br>Returning to your graphical approach in general again, some might say something along the lines of "But, but, but <i>*insert name of successful retro-style game or old time classic*</i> doesn't have great graphics!", to which I would probably reply, "Actually, it does, it has decent looking retro-style/dated presentation."<br><br>My point is this, whatever graphical style that you're going for, 2d or 3d, AAA, retro or something in between, you <i>must</i> achieve a certain level of quality and appeal if you wanting people to invest in it.<br><br>Having said all of the above, your video shows some fun gameplay mechanics and levels, which suggests that Tompi Jones has a great deal of untapped potential. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

We've been mixing elements in the scenarios without a professional graphic designer and we can not expect better results. Right now, without raising funds for the development of the game, it will be difficult to change everything. If we get funding then we will do serious changes in this direction.<br><br>One decision we have taken is remodel our hero. We decided to go with the cartoon style but with a more humanized look. Soon we hope to show some pictures. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
