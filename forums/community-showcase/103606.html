The lighting of the scene is not improving the figures distinguishability ... I would prefer a more "lighted" scene ... more vibrant colors for the figures, maybe even give them more "sporty" outfits - this ones look like from "Outcast".<br>The layout of the GUI lacks some hmm (now the word is missing :D) ... look similar compared to each other ... consistence? For now they look a bit like they belong to different widgets coming from different sources.<br><br>- distance graph: the "100m" is cut off - is this because of the screenshot or something to fix? - maybe the whole graphic is displaced on x-axis by +15/+20 pixels ?<br><br>- use BPM / use Speed: is this intended to be a toggle? - if so, follow the standards of toggles (on-off-switches / left-right-one-is-down-approach)<br><br>- start / stop / quit: if "start" changes to "pause" after pressing it: ignore the rest, if not: start and stop are a "toggle" - if the thing is not running, do not show "stop" (as it then does nothing). Just switch texts and "functionality". This saves screen space.<br><br><br>- time display: "Time:   36 : 10  ... 36 : 9"<br>Maybe put a "0" in front of the seconds/minutes/hours if you display something "in front" (another unit.<br>So "6 seconds" is ok ... but "1:6" for "1 min, 6 seconds" looks odd. Just add a "if seconds &lt; 0 then timeString :+ "0"; timeString+seconds" etc. (think you know what I mean).<br><br>- avg speed: Why display both at the time (mph kmh)? Just make it an option and hide the unwanted unit. Above "Up down up down" you display "Min speed: ..." - why only "mph" there? With "Now Speed" being "kmh" it lacks again some consistency.<br><br>-Max gap: if you display it like you currently do (left col / right col) it might look a bit like if it is a "per person" value ... which is not the case, maybe just use a phrase: "Max Gap was 146m from 3969-4105m." - or think about tooltips. Or <br>"Gap:    92m [Max: 146m @ 3969m]"<br>Also you use "Gap: 92 metres" while in other lines you use "m" - consistency.<br><br><br>Sorry for only criticizing things (@GaryV -- your chance to blame me for writing something to every topic :p) but better someone writes somethings about improving a product than nothing.<br><br>Also ignore the above if you knew everything I noted and it is all already subject of changes.<br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So this configuration could be set before deploying the betas. The Installer then creates user data directories etc - should not be needed to be done by the app itself.<br><br>But maybe we just tackle things differently - so the "install scripts" part is more a "imho" than a critic or so.<br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
