Use keys 1,2 and 3 to pick your camera. I've moved the top-down camera further away as the speed increases, so you can see further ahead along the road. (Note that the arrows don't quite work in 3rd and 1st person views).<br><br>I've also changed the steering speed so the car can flick left and right a bit faster, altered the collision code slightly so the car bounces off the scenery better, and increased gravity when in the air so it lands faster.<br><br>Finally, you can turn the smoke off with F1, which may help get the framerate up on slower PCs, and I've changed the FLIP mode to wait for a vertical blank, so perhaps that will help....<br><br>Anyway, all you need is the new EXE -<br><a href="http://www.jameskett.dsl.pipex.com/BR_exe.zip" target="_blank">http://www.jameskett.dsl.pipex.com/BR_exe.zip</a><br><br>Overwrite the EXE in the other demo file ( <a href="http://www.jameskett.dsl.pipex.com/BRDemo.zip" target="_blank">http://www.jameskett.dsl.pipex.com/BRDemo.zip</a> ) with the new one.<br><br>Here are a few screenies -<br><img src="http://www.jameskett.dsl.pipex.com/BRallyB1.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.jameskett.dsl.pipex.com/BRallyB2.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.jameskett.dsl.pipex.com/BRallyB3.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.jameskett.dsl.pipex.com/BRallyB4.jpg"><br><br>There'll be no more updates for a while as I'm working on AI for other cars, because I think that Rallycross might be more fun than rallying, but I need working AI and car-to-car collisions for that.<br><br>Thanks<br>James <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I had more success using Tokamak than ODE, despite ODE's car wheel joint, but this current system still feels more solid, and much more fun to drive. If someone can develop a car physics system in ODE/Tokamak that feels good, I may reconsider.<br><br>I think it will become a Rallycross game rather than a pure rally game though, as I like the pack racing feel and the single short rallycross circuits negate the 'no-idea-where-the-track-goes-next' problem that is inherent to a top-down racer. I currently have the AI racing 8 CPU cars around, albeit only on a single path, but they jostle and spin out and it seems to be fun, which is more important than realism.<br><br>Rallycross tracks also don't have jumps, which is good because I'm not that happy with the way the car jumps at the moment. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It looks like the flickering diminishes while shifting gears, but any time you are accelerating, the sky flickers continuously... Pretty distracting. I don't remember if the original version had the same issue as well or not (don't have the original .exe anymore) Either way it's less noticable in the top view version since you see a lot less sky in that viewpoint.<br><br>-As far as the controls are concerned: If I were you, I would seriously consider making them user configurable in any 'final' version. If you grew up with the QAOP key combo it may not sound like a big deal, but to me that is probably the biggest turn-off in your game as it is at the moment  -- It requires you to use both of your hands for the steering alone, on top of needing one of your hands to break and such.  Cursor keys allow you to do all the stearing with one hand, and the breaking with the other. It's also what the majority of other 'modern' racing games I've played are using, so a habit kind of hard to break. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The track is built from sections, like Scalextric, arranged end to end, so when you exit one section and go to the next it updates what sections are visible and what is not. I tried using FREEENTITY and creating new sections, but that was really slow, so currently it's just hiding and showing sections that are pre-created and pre-positioned. Perhaps all these sections, although hidden, are slowing things down too much?<br><br>My other guess is that memory allocation issues are present, because I can replicate this jerkiness if I disable mip-mapping, which floods my videocard with textures going back and forth as the track sections become visible. Even forcing textures to VRam doesn't help, and i'm not using that many textures...very odd.<br><br>I think that for a long road-race style game, a render system like OpenGL is needed - Blitz's entity system doesn't seem to be able to cope with the dynamic creation and deletion of reasonably complex meshes.<br><br>Anyway, I'm moving to a single loaded rallycross-style track mesh, so there will be no need to update a long rally track. for that - we'll have to see if that sorts out your problems.
