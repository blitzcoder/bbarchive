This is what creates the difficulty since unlike the enemy paths, you can't easily predict where and when the bullets will show up.  It should be noted that all bullets are fired downward right now, but that is simply because sideways and diagonal bullets, and all the other types of bullets, are not yet implemented. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Do you think the ship moves almost too fast now?  Unfortunately, the speed of stuff moved with the mouse is controlled by what the user has set in Windows for mouse speed.  I am not sure if it is possible to set a standard speed, or if that would even be wise.  My own mouse speed is set to 3/4 of max.  <br><br>Actually, the speed it moves at right now is probably what I would have for the default.  I don't know if I will have a powerup to increase the movement speed, as it might feel weird to have it change.  It might feel too much like a mouse pointer then.  I did plan to have something to speed up the rate at which enemies move and spawn though.  That might also speed up the player's movement, but I haven't decided.  I'll have to try it and see.<br><br><div class="quote"> <br>Also I can fire extremely lots of bullets if I'm prepared to click real fast, is it going to be like that always?<br> <br></div><br><br>I haven't decided, but it could well stay that way.  For the weapons obviously I considered having two shots fire at once, and shots fire in different directions at the same time, but I also considered a powerup which would just fire a fast constant stream of bullets without you having to click for a short time.<br><br>The problem with limiting the rate of fire is this.  If I limit the rate, and require the player to click for each shot, while clicking for each shot can be more fun than just holding the button down, clicking and then not having a shot appear because the gun hasn't recharged would not feel good at all.  It would be annoying.  So either I have the user click for each shot and let them fire as much as they want as often as they want, or I have them simply hold down the mouse button and the shots fire off at a set rate.  I think what I've chosen is probably the more fun, with a game like this where you're not throwing a hundred enemies at the player at once.<br><br>Though that is an idea...  If I used the enemies at the original scale they would be 3x smaller.  I could put a lot more of them on the screen and a lot more bullets and the player could still dodge them because their ship would be smaller too.  I wonder if this would be better or not.  I think it might get people's attention at least, like with Cromsonland where the screenshots show like a hundred guys on screen at once.  That's pretty impressive.<br><br><div class="quote"> <br>The stars seem to move more smoothly now, did you implement the 0.5 in your y coords yet for perfect consistent rounding as suggested originally by Beaker e.g. y=floor(y+0.5)?<br> <br></div><br><br>I treid that 0.5 thing but it didn't make sense to me, and it seemed to make the stars move more choppy.  So I just went back to the plain old Floor() I was using.<br><br>I really can't be screwing aorund with the stars any more.  They're good enough IMO at this point.  There's lots of games out there where they move much less smoothly.  There's no point in trying to be perfect with the stars when I have the whole rest of the game to write. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

However, the 0.5 shouldn't have made them more choppy, it should have made it more accurate ho hum.  See basically if bankers rounding rounds 1.5 to 2 and 2.5 to 2, your method: floor 1.5 = 1, floor 2.5 = 2, mine: floor (1.5 + 0.5) = 2, floor (2.5+0.5) = 2.  So it might not seem any different yours and mine except mine rounds .5 up and yours rounds .5 down BUT.  Yours: floor 1.8 = 1, mine: floor (1.8+0.5) = 2, now which one seems more correct?

I'd say mine is more correct.<br><br>If you use your method, and you start a star out at 0 and move it to 600 at a rate of one pixel per second, then halfway through the first second, it will jump to the second pixel, but then from there on it will take one second to jump from pixel to pixel.  With your method, in order to get that star to stay on the first pixel for one second so that it stays on all pixels for the same amount of time, I have to start it "off screen" with an offset of -0.5.  Of course it is not off screen at that point after the rounding, so the floating point and the integer coordinates now aren't consistent with one another as to what is onscreen and what is not, and I have to start everyhting eith a weird negative offset.<br><br>So I don't think that is a very good method.  It reminds me of what a pain it is working with texture coordinates, and I'd rather stay away from that icky stuff when I'm working in 2D. :-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Anyway, yeah there isn't a way around unless keys are used which you are trying to avoid of course.<br><br>hmm, re: the 0.5 thing.  My method gives proper rounded figures where 0.5 always rounds up, that's all.  The way you've chosen to apply it with it having to start at -0.5 to ensure 1 second on a pixel is pretty obscure.  In the case of stars, who cares if the first one is only on the same pixel for half the time?  Having said that, your plain floor method should result in just as smooth stars as mine, I've just calculated (due to its consistency), so it doesn't really matter plus, yours is faster.  Be in mind the 0.5 method though as I'm sure it can be useful for games where the objects have x and y coords and move in non-integer jumps.  When I was coding Iron Fist I ran into problems just using floor when doing gravity and landing on platform calculations, can't remember why, but the rounding business sorted it out.<br><br>Anyway, I look forward to seeing you next version!<br><br>[edit]ooh I forgot to ask, is the collision pixel perfect or not.  Mine is but I found that it can get slow with loads of bullets on screen, so I'm going to make the bullet collision areas rectangle and keep the aliens (and your craft) pixel perfect.  This will reduce the collision overhead by a lot I'm sure.  Furthermore I found a massive optimisation with collision detection in Iron Fist.  Previously I was testing all objects against all objects, a cartesian join.  I thought that blitz would go, nah this rectangle is nowhere near that one and thu skip the collision code.  But on a hunch I made my own wrapper around the collision routine to check if the man was in the same vertical column as other objects, and if so then only test those objects.  It sped up my collision routine massively!  Hard to believe that an optimisation like that would make any difference (if the blitz internal code was supposedly already efficient) but it did, trust me, try it yourself! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That problem you had there was a common one where the number of checks increases exponentially with the number of objects.  I suspect you simply coded your collision code incorrectly.<br><br>Let's say you have a hundred bullets.  You said you were checking every object against all other objects.  If that includes bullets then that means you may well have been doing 100*100 checks.  <br><br>Of course, if you are observant, you will realise that if you check object 1 versus object 100 then you need not check object 100 versus object 1.  That brings us down from 10,000 checks down to (n*(n+1)) / 2 or 5050 checks.<br><br>However, if you are particularly observant, (and your game design allows for it) you will realise that you don't need to check any of the bullets with eachother at all.<br><br>In my games, I usually have a bullet type, a player type, and an enemy type.  The bullet type contains a source parameter which tells me if it was fired by a player or an alien.<br><br>My loops are as follows:<br><br>1. Check each bullet against player.  Ignore bullets with source player.<br>2. Check each bullet against each alien.  Ignore bullets with source alien.<br>3. Check each alien against player.<br><br>Now I can have a lot more bullets and aliens on the screen.  I still have the problem of course that if I have a lot of bullets and aliens then I will have a lot of collision checks to do, but it is a lot less than if I had to check every bullet against every bullet and every alien against every alien.<br><br>What you did checking the column the player was in is pretty clever, but you still need to compare that column with every object in the game.  If I understand what you did correctly, your trick works because checking columms is faster than checking bounding boxes, if only a little.<br><br>You were almost to a great solution for checking lots and lots of collision objects against eachother, one that I would use in my own games.<br><br>That solution is this:  <br>Divide the world up into boxes of equal size.  Then place a pointer to each object in every box it overlaps.  Then simply loop through the boxes and compare the objects in each box to see if they overlap.  The difficult part here is making sure you don't spawn multiple explosions when the same two objects collide in multiple boxes at the same time.    In my game, I don't use this method.  But when a player hits an enemy or a bullet and they explode, I don't bother checking the rest of the enemies or bullets.  If you are not using this method to perform physiucs between lots of objects then you can get away with doing that to solve the problem.  Otherwise you may need to keep a list for each object that says which objects it was checked against and check that each time you go to check it against another object.  All this checking would make for some messy code, but it should be a lot faster if you have tons of objects onscreen than checking them against one another, or even checking to see if they are in the same column.<br><br>Anyway, it isn't Blitz fault that checking collisions in your game slow, because it's not possible for Mark to implement this sort of collision system that can optimize the number of checks, without forcing you to use some kind of Blitz collision system.  That's what he does in Blitz 3D, and it works well, though he probably does not use the method I decribed above to optimize it.  He uses some other method.  Or maybe it is not optimized.  I don't know.  But he could optimize it if he wanted. :-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

To do this, I use an array of types for bullets and another for enemies.  Why? Because all objects in the game arethe same Type, they have the same available properties so one function can be used to manipulate all the sub-types (no inheritance in B.Plus).  I don't want to look through all the objects and check their Sub-Type flag, just the ones in the relevent array. If I implement an ammo type that can destroy alien bullets then I'll need to check bullets against alien bullets too.<br><br>Your box method sounds interesting, a way to further reduce the bounding rect checks.  What I found out is that alway checking a bounding rect BEFORE calling Blitz Plus's pixel perfect collision detection is faster, and only checking a column is even faster.  I chose this method in my platform game because the levels were mainly long not tall, so there were less platforms to check vertically than horizontally.  My platforms were all objects so they could be positioned and moved anywhere, as opposed to using an old-style grid system.<br><br>Sorry your thread is brick-like.

That's a cool game btw.  So is Blue thingy or whatever it's called.<br><br>Big10p: Thanks for the link, that's a cool method, might change me platformer to use it, maybe.  The thing with the pixel perfect Blitz routines is, yes I'm sure they do do bounding rect stuff BUT I found it much faster to do bounding rect stuff externally before calling (or not calling) the pixelperfect collision.  I had the logic time shown on-screen in MS and thought it was too high so optimised the collision detection as I've just described and reduced it by a massive factor.<br><br>Crud I've run out of bandwidth AGAIN!

I think having an overheating gun adds a really good 'strategic' dynamic to shooters. Just letting the player autofire forever gets pretty boring, IMO.<br><br>I also like chargeable weapons where you hold fire down to charge and let out a big blast when you let go - like in R-Type. You may not want this for your game, though. Just a thought. :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
