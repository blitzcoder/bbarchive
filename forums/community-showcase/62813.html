Lovely animations of nicely designed characters, and a great puzzle-type game.  I've found it quite addictive--probably as much because of the excellent look of the game as the gameplay itself.  By the way, what were the characters modelled/animated in?<br><br>Anyway, I have found a gameplay problem.  I've been playing the level in the bottom left corner of the levels selection menu.  Timing is the key, and it's very very tight.  I can solve this level as I'm sure it was intended with my resolution set to 800x600.  However, if I crank the resolution up to the highest setting, it becomes impossible.  I lose framerate, of course, but it's not terrible.  The character movements feel consistent, but in the higher resolution I can no longer get into that first hiding place in time.<br><br>Re: level selection menu.  I'd suggest numbering the levels.  Multiple pages makes sense, but maybe a smoothly scrollable area with all levels would be better--so you can fit in as many levels as you or anyone else cares to design.  I would imagine that eventually you'll make it so the levels must be solved in order;  as you solve levels they're unlocked, and can then be re-played at any time.  However, for testing purposes the current setup is preferable. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

As for splitting the levels into multiple screens, that will happen but not at the moment.  I'll try to add text showing level name and type but right now the focus is sound.  Don't worry, this menu is just temp and the proper menu system will be filled with bells &amp; whistles.<br><br>@Barliesque - Thanks for the kind words.  All the modeling and animation was done in Lightwave.  Two suggestions for your problem with the 4th regular level:<br><br>1) if you're having frame issues at higher resolutions then the videocard is probably running out of ram (textures aren't optimized yet).  Try switching the bit depth from 32 to 16.  It'll knock down the RAM usage a lot.  Using this trick on that level with my Riva TNT 2 card at 1280x960 I saw frame rates go from 18FPS to 35FPS.  Not bad for a 10 year old card!!!<br><br>2) You can 'buffer' your next move with the keyboard.  Example: hold down the left arrow key to go left.  After you start moving then hold down the up arrow key.  Because the up arrow was pressed most recently it will take priority when you reach a 'crossroad'.  In your case by buffering the 'up' key the player will go into hiding as soon as is possible.  This is a great way to cut corners and get from place to place as quickly as possible! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I made a level editor and use it to build the levels.

You're dead right!!! I spent a ton of time yesterday investigating why my delta timing was letting me down and I found it.  The entities need a speedfactor attached to their movements to compensate for when the frame rate takes a nose dive.  I'll put that in to effect so ALL puzzles will run 100% the same on ALL machines, even when they're running at 3FPS.  :)  Great find!

I was thinking the other day that too many C64 etc games were too hard, and that modern games need to be easier to give the player a sense of progression.  As you are developing the game you may feel that it's easy as you know all the tricks but we don't of course.  Something to bear in mind when making the final levels :-) Also this game in a way reminds me off Professor Fizzwizzle, which also has a neat cheat mode where it "plays" the solution for you (you can interrupt it if you don't want to see it all).  this would be INVALUABLE in your game and avoid people not playing any more due to frustration...

Part of my initial inspiration was the C64 game 'Castles of Dr. Creep' with more trap elements and *slightly* better graphics. :)  As for the 'cheat mode'- way ahead of you there.  The full version will have that autoplay feature where you can reveal the puzzle in real time and take over whenever you want.  But that will have to wait until I get the mouse control plugged back in (yes, I mean mouse control for gameplay!) and finish the recording system.  <br><br>@Barliesque- I would love some feedback as to what people feel the order should be for the nine regular levels.  And while I agree it would be better to wait until I get the delta issue nailed down the problem is time is not on my side.  I need to get my inital beta turned in to the IGF by this coming Friday.

(17 meg) <br><br>Tons of changes!!! <br><br>The key thing: I've pulled back on the difficulty on harder levels.  For example...<br><img src="http://www.mediumedge.com/bbb/pics/bbb09.jpg"><br>I set it up so that there's tons of time between when the energy beams go off &amp; come back on.  Also, I added an additional set of ladders to make it even easier to 'fake out' the bot and get past him.  <br><br>Also, on the 'level select' screen it now keeps track of completed levels:<br><img src="http://www.mediumedge.com/bbb/pics/bbb07.jpg"><br><br>And there's a 'controls' screen for those that don't feel like reading the 'readme' file:<br><img src="http://www.mediumedge.com/bbb/pics/bbb08.jpg"><br><br>Here's a complete breakdown of v68 changes:<br> -revised several levels to make them more accessable.  Reduced difficulty of the timing elements in the puzzles.  <br> -the level select screen now displays which levels have been completed.<br> -changed the order of the levels to reflect the changes in difficulty.<br> -added a screen that shows a breakdown of the controls.<br> -revised menu interaction.<br> -added a graphical load screen.<br> -added names and classifications to all of the levels in the demo.<br><br>Barring any major unknown issues, this is the version I'll be sending to the IGF.  Then I can get back to work on adding more to the game in the following order:<br>-sound effects &amp; music (hope to have them in within a month)<br>-fix delta timing issue on slower machines (within a month)<br>-complete missing animations.<br>-optimize textures (maybe switch to DDS) and complete other optimizations.<br>-add proper GUI system<br>-add more levels<br>-add singleplayer storyline<br><br>So, give this new version a try (come on, it's only 17 meg!).  I think you'll find it a lot less frusterating. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The levels will all be properly grouped into their section based on difficulty.  The cutting on the 'How to Play' page is interesting.  I see you're running it @1280.

But as we now know, running the game at a higher res on an older machine (with an older video card) can cause an issue with the timing.  I know how to correct the error but there's tons of code that needs tweaking.  I promise that addressing the imperfections with the delta timing is a priority.<br><br>The good news: I've been testing DDS textures and the video ram requirements have dropped by a massive factor which is the key cause of this problem!  I've been testing it on my 5 year old laptop (P3/850 with a GeForce 2go 16 meg card).  With DDS textures, the game went from a slideshow at any resolution to a silky smooth frame rate even at 1024x768!!!  Combining this with the upcoming delta timing fix, all of these timing issues should become a distant memory.  <br><br>In the meantime... Barliesque's suggestion was dead on.  A lower resolution should help.  Also, try playing the level at 'full wide' by hitting the spacebar.  The camera will be fixed and with less movement it might play a little better.  Once again, these are all temporary workarounds.  When I get everything completed none of this should be necessary.  Keep in mind that it is still beta and is being created by a team of one.   :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
