The early development part I guess is because I recoded everything at the end of last year after my code became one big tangled mess (I used very few functions). So after I recoded it, I wanted to just get the game out there (off my chest in a way) before my ideas got incorporated into other games, after alot of the work I spent on it.<br><br>Great point about navigating around. One thing I'll try to incorporate for my next update is an arrow mesh that will hover above the ship, pointed at the currently targeted object. I also think having at least one landmark in each sector will help,  and I am thinkiing of putting in "space buoy's" around the main perimeter of each sector. Thanks again!<br><br><b>SystemError51</b>, thanks for the compliments. Good idea about the nacelles glowing and room lights. Now that you mention it, I might also put in effects on the nacelles when you warp, kind of like the Enterprise does in the classic movies, and maybe even effects on the primary thrusters \ impulse (the yellow parts on the back of the ship) when you cruise around. Those effects will be easily done with sprites, so I'll definitely try to put it in for the next update. <br><br>I will consider refining the models, probably something later down the road. And I'll definitely keep you guys up to date, thanks!<br><br><b>RemiD</b>, thanks for the feedback! Thanks to your post, I'm now convinced that a tutorial is needed.<br><br><b>psychicbottle</b>, awesome! Thanks for downloading my demo! Yeah, feel free to post any ideas, I can't guarantee to accept all of them, but I'll definitely let you know what I think of each one. If there are good ideas, and its something I didn't think of before, I'll give you credit.<br><br>Probably down the road, I would like to allow sending rovers on small planets or even being able to walk around on a small planet. I've considered adding an escape pod that can fly around and have a junkyard sector (where I might put the freighter). I also planned to put in a damaged friendly vessel that you can rescue (where I got the idea for a radio can receive distress calls) so that's something else I'd like to put in.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

And I appreciate that you like it. <br><br>The hand gun is the only way to destroy the asteroids. But you can do a trick (not sure if its a real trick since I'm telling you how to do it, haha) with the repair system to stay alive without leaving the bridge. <br><br>What you do, is turn on your shields when you go to warp, and when they get damaged a bit (to about 65%) you turn them off and let the ship body take some damage while you tell the ship the to repair the shields. Go back to the helm \ front console and once the shield button pops up (meaning that they're repaired) you turn back on the shields and repair the ship body....then you repeat the process all over again.<br><br>Essentially you alternate the repairs between the shields and body. Letting one take damage as you're repairing the other. Giving it enough time to repair each one fully before switching them.<br><br>Many thanks again! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I've made attempts to make the game more accessible (with some in-game directions and a help screen) as well as some basic features (sound effects, options screen, help screen, 1024x768 resolution) and lastly some bells and whistles (particle effects, a puzzle, scanning items, etc).<br><br><u>I also want to thank some of our resident members here for their great feedback which helped shape this latest update.</u> Like <u><b>RemiD</b></u> for his suggestion about the help messages. I want to thank <u><b>SystemError51</b></u> for suggesting that I put in particle effects. And lastly <u><b>Taron</b></u> for mentioning the need for 3D navigation, which gave me the idea for the space buoy's!<br><br><b>So where do I play this game (I don't see a link??!??)</b><br>To avoid confusion, I've updated the original post to include new screens and a new download link. So either scroll up or <a href="/post.php?topic=98509&amp;post=1193742" target="_blank">go here</a>. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

When I finally figured out how to get in the space suit and eject out into space I was like "ohh ahh this is so neat!" before freaking out thinking I could fall off sides of the ship... Luckily my character was smart enough to space walk instead.<br><br>The only complaint I have is that is runs a bit choppy for me and the image tearing is really bad despite forcing vertical sync and triple buffering on. I will try this on another machine and a CRT to see if the problem persists.<br><br>I really dig the concepts of your game. Imagine if you had to send your buddy out into space while your piloting the ship? To keep it from drifting into the atmosphere of a moon or something. Then those spiders attack and you have to make the choice of sealing your comrade out into space thus saving the ship and yourself or risking everything to try and fight off the spiders and save him. There are so many different possibilities and scenarios you could come up with. Good work! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It helps me know how people feel when playing the game. Also, that's a really good point about having co-op. Adding multi-player would add alot to this game. Maybe someday!<br><br>I also appreciate that you tried it on two different computers. Would you mind me asking what Operating System you first tried it on? <br><br>Following the directions of the Blitzbasic help files, I used CreateTimer() to regulate performance. But for some reason, I used CreateTimer(90) when the help file says to use frameTimer=CreateTimer(60). So hopefully this change will help.<br><br>Thanks again for your feedback! It helps!<br><br><u><b>@RemiD:</b></u> Thanks for giving SpaceJourney another go! And thank you for the compliments of the game.<br><br>As for the speed of the game, as I told NostalgicAlgorithms, I might've used CreateTimer() in the wrong way. So hopefully this will fix things! Thanks for bringing it to my attention!<br><br>Thanks for bringing up the menu bar thing. I think the fix for that is easy (like a flushmouse issue).<br><br><b>As for what to do:</b> you have to collect 4 pieces of an artifact in each of the four sectors, using the tractor beam at the back console. This is also mentioned if you walk up to the chair. But that message will appear at the start of the game in the next update.<br><br>There is a space station with a hostile turret in sector 2 (that you can dock at, but make sure you dock using the ship's computer, not manually) and there are enemy warships that you encounter in sector 3. <br><br>In the future, I would like random encounters with friendly ships which can conduct in trade. Mining is also on the table in the future-- as the science panel is kind of the precursor to that (so far you only can probe planets, but that will be the basis for knowing whether you can mine it). <br><br><b>And I would like 1st person exploration of planets.</b> Maybe I could let the player explore chunks of it. Also, I would like small planets, like the one in sector 3, to be explored using a rover. Just to need figure out the code to implement spherical movement.<br><br><b>I'm trying to avoid upgrading the ship \ gun</b>, to keep things more simplistic. As I feel alot of games get too deep into nitty gritty updates and such and I want give the ship and gun new functions rather than just increasing a bunch of stats. But who knows! In the next few updates, the gun will give the player better aid when they're outside of their ship, with buttons on a display panel in the blue screen.<br><br><b>Resource management is interesting.</b> Someone has also suggested fuel management. If those things can make the game more fun, I'll consider implementing that. Good suggestion!<br><br>Thanks for all of your suggestions and feedback! Its appreciated!<br><br><u><b>@Steve Elliott:</b></u> Thanks for playing!<br><br>Yeah, sci-fi movies and shows like Star Trek and 2001 were definitely inspirational in many ways! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

For instance, the rudder mode allows the player to control the ship while standing on the exterior of the ship. The other two functions give the player info while they are outside of the ship. <a href="http://youtu.be/MdqjkcCzeGc" target="_blank">The new trailer</a> shows these function off so you can see them in action!<br><br><b>(*)Laser on the gun has been improved:</b> <br>That annoying glitch where the laser would move with you after shooting it is GONE.<br><br><br><br>Now...I admit that this isn't much. My intended plan was to release smaller updates in shorter spans of time. However, since I haven't had time to work on anything until this summer, I was basically sitting on this update and thought I might as well get it out and move on to the next version.<br><br>I also wanted to make more updates to optimize the game's performance, and wasn't able to find a solution-- primarily because I don't own a computer that was having the same issues that people were reporting. In the future I might consolidate some of the textures, since I did use multiple textures for one model, which I'm sure eats up memory on the game, but that would be a pretty extensive update. <br><br>At best, I can smooth out the gun's aiming motion in the next update and I did flix the glitch on the gun's laser for this latest version. So hopefully it will be slighly less irritating. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
