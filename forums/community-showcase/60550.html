They either didn't export to 32-bit PNG or they didn't optimize the packing very well, and I was originally planning to update Jim B's ImagePacker to support 32-bit PNG, as the packing itself seemed good.<br><br>Anyway, I decided it might be fun to write my own, and boy was I wrong. It was bloody horrible, but it was a great learning experience trying out various things until I got an algorithm that is really tight.<br><br>I figured a good test would be to try it with some images from Filax's GUI, as they come in such a wide range of sizes and shapes that they're bound to be very hard to pack neatly into a texture. Indeed they proved very challenging, and pushed me to keep optimizing the pack algorithm over and over until I couldn't see any way I could have done it better by hand.<br><br>And so, without further ado, here's a screenshot of the packed texture ( real size, but 256 color-ized so that no one nicks Filax's graphics and so that it loads fast on a webpage. )<br><br><img src="http://members.aol.com/sybixsus/ippreview.gif"><br><br>At the moment, the application itself is a bit rough around the edges, strictly for personal use. But I'm thinking of doing it up a bit, adding support for a few more formats ( jpg, tga, perhaps BMP ) and selling it for a low price.<br><br>It also exports an xml document with the packed texture which you can then use to access each image within your program. If I can find an XML module for BMax, I may even write a quick BlitzMax module to parse the XML and create a list of images and their pixel locations, and sizes on the texture. But you've got the XML document so you could use the packed textures in any language, any engine, you wanted.<br><br>It supports variable sized padding already ( to avoid bleeding with texture filtering. I disable filtering for mine, but not everyone will want to. )  but if there are any must-have features you would like to see, name them and I'll see what I can do. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'll grab that and see what I can do.<br><br>Tim: Thanks. Took me a while to get it as optimized as I wanted, but I think it's there now.<br><br>Filax: Oh, no problem. It already respects bitmap alpha. I just exported the GIF without transparency because GIF only supports 1 channel alpha, which looks ugly on a forum. But if you export a PNG, it exports the alpha channel exactly as it is on all the base textures.<br><br>Grisu: Eh? In what way is it not working correctly?<br><br><br>I'm currently thinking that the demo version needs to be able to demonstrate how well it will work on the images you have. That way, if people try it and it makes a bad job of their images, they can contact me and I can see if I can revise the algorithm any further, and they can be confident before buying.<br><br>So I'm thinking that a fully functional demo version which watermarks the output is probably best. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I've rewritten my XML exporter to use his module instead. Shouldn't be hard to knock up a little BMax module suitable for whatever engine you're using when the app itself is complete. Beyond that, you'll have the XML, so you could really use it in any language, with any engine. In fact - although the application will be Win32 only, it could be used to produce textures for x-platform development.<br><br>Also, thanks to Noel's devIL module, I've added export support for DDS Compressed Textures ( 5 varieties ) as well as TGA, BMP, TIFF, PSD and PSP. I think that covers all the possible export formats you could possibly want, in conjunction with the PNG and JPG exports which were already there.<br><br>Now I might have a look and see about importing some or all of those formats as well as exporting them. Not sure how practical that's gonna be, but I'll give that a good try.<br><br>What seems like a fair price for this, BTW? I don't wanna rip anyone off, but it's quite a lot of work coming up with a really solid packing algorithm that packs as tightly as this does, so I reckon it's saving you quite a bit of work.<br><br>And again, if there are any must-have features you'd like to see, let me know before I release the beta. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Some are down to 10x20 pixels etc. <br></div><br>If you're using BlitzMax or any 3d accelerated 2d, you have 16x32 pixels because they're resized to power of 2. You don't use more memory by having separate images. Your graphics just take a lot longer to render than they would if they were packed onto a single texture. Combining images/textures into one single texture is one of the simplest and most effective ways to speed up any 3d or 2d-in-3d code, so that's why I wrote this for myself.<br><br>Since there's not much interest in it, I probably won't bother putting any more time into polishing up the interface and writing documentation for it. Just thought I'd post here and see if there was enough interest to warrant releasing it. It'd be great if I could release it for free, but people expect a lot of support on free tools, and I'm not in a position to offer that kind of support unless it's at least bringing in a *little* money. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'll leave it a while and put the work in next week or whenever if there's sufficient interest.<br><br><div class="quote"> Can you give us some examples on how you would use this?  <br></div><br>Sure. Any time your game is drawing a lot of different images, there is a small delay as the videocard changes from one image to the next. You try to group your drawing commands to minimize this, but there's only so much you can do. So you take a series of images which are drawn together ( all background tiles, all character tiles ( animated? ) or all landscape textures ( 3d? ) or whatever and put them on one texture so that all drawing operations are done without the videocard ever changing the texture.<br><br>Now that you've identified which images you want to draw together, you fire up texture packer and add all the images ( a folder-full at a time is probably easiest. ) Now you pick a border size ( 1 or 2 pixels should be fine ) and click on the pack button. TexturePacker creates a new texture, puts all your images on it as tightly packed as it can, and you're done. Now just export to PNG/BMP/JPG/DDS/PSD/PSP/TIFF and an XML definitions file.<br><br>Now the XML file contains the original names of the images, and the x,y coordinates and width and height that they can be found on the new packed texture. So every time you want to draw an image, just draw the section from x,y to x+w-1,y+h-1 instead.<br><br>I won't spend too much time eulogizing on the subject of speed improvements from single-texture or single-surface drawing ( in 2d ) and texturing ( in 3d ) because there are dozens of threads about it on here, but I've found it the single most effective speed boost you can get, on any engine, and probably even more so on Blitz3d.<br><br>Hey, I wouldn't have spent three weeks figuring out pack algorithms if I didn't think it was going to make a huge difference to my GUI rendering ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
