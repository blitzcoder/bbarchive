Discuss! <br></div>Agree that the intex systems are a little useless at the moment.  But I think we've had a fair few ideas that would make them worthwhile.  However, they do need to be "programmable" in some way.  They're already objects (defined in the default object file with a script of "intex()"), so I think intex systems (or at least some on a given level) become level specific with a parameterised script, e.g. "intex(blah,blah)".  You'd probably need to add stuff to the level definition rather than stick it all in the script actually, so maybe "intex(ID)" which then looks up what to do in the level def. file?<br><br>So, if that's how to do it; what do we use it for?<br>1) Remote camera idea from previous thread<br>2) Controlling turrets remotely (better than a simple switch, maybe password controlled?)<br>3) Email - for furthering the plot, providing passwords, gaining / completing objectives (e.g. log on to the boss's computer and download an incriminating email?)<br>4) Special actions to complete objectives, access different areas.  e.g. downloading data files, turning on / off systems, opening doors, firing launch sequences, triggering level destruct.<br>5) The map function - although arguably this should live on the PocketPC.  But you could have a high-level (blurred) map of the level on the intex systems too.<br><br>That's what I can think of off the top of my head.  I think they're worth holding onto.<br><br>By the way, I'm unlikely to be able to make much of a contribution over the next week or so code-wise.  I'll poke my head in to contribute to discussion though, just busy with real life.<br><br>Oh, and to answer enigma's question about a story from the end of the last thread - I have written one way back in a very old thread.  Take a look and tell me what you think. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The idea of "blueprints" for levels is good, but I reckon these could be a good use of the intex system - that you can view a "blueprint" map once you're in the level, rather than before - it's far more useful once you're inside anyway!<br><br>As a general note, I think we need to have a period of consolidation - tidying up code, fixing bugs, commenting, doccing, rather than adding too much to the code base.  Or at least, for you and me Rob!  This will give us a decent stable base, and also allow others (like Frank) to get up to speed and hopefully contribute.  I do think that our pace (or yours at least!) actually limits the ability of others to contribute.  It's great that you're so committed, and motivating and all, but I do wonder if we shouldn't have something like a planned release schedule, e.g. every Monday night publish latest code, etc? And people should submit code for that release by the Sunday?<br><br>Something to discuss anyway, particularly anyone out there watching and not contributing - why aren't you, and what can we do to help you do so? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'm currently re-working then so this isn't the case, the problem is that after I put the model into lithunwrap I lose all the animation information so I've got to do the whole lot again, which is time consuming to say the least.<br><br>Personally I hate animated textures because I think they look totally pants. We can certainly reduce the amount of particles if necessary, and this could a setting anyway. There's currently no limiting on the amount of particles on screen so I could easily put a cap on that.<br><br>PS, That bot code looks like it would be very very slow, why not just get it to look left and right with line pick or something? Just do one line pick per cycle, making it look from -90 degress to 90 incrementing in 10. Also using a line pick would mean it will see walls and other bots so can avoid them too without additional code loops. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Eventhough I liked the game itself it didn't really grab the excitement of the movie and was, in my opinion, a bit pale in comparisment. I expected something more like as in Narco Police on the Amiga (if anyone remembers? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzDQb8mBpI4" target="_blank">Youtube</a> ~2:30) Therefore I much rather see an AlienBreed 3D, which should be just as easy to create as a topdowner, but that's my personal preference of course.<br>In this respect I love the fact that the demo version's media contains this 'nice' Alien.b3d model:<br><br>Run:	1 - 16<br>Attack:	17 - 25<br>Die:	26 - 33<br><img src="http://i58.tinypic.com/2jg0xg6.jpg"><br><i>(Here it comes, take out your flame thrower guys!)</i><br><br>Just imagine that coming at you from a dark corridor.
