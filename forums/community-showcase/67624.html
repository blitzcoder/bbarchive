The game runs in 800x600.  <br><br><br>Controls:<br><br>1. Move with mouse.  <br><br>2. Fire with left mouse button.  <br><br>3. Toggle weapons with right mouse button, or press keys 1 thru 9. (Not all weapons you see are intended to be fired from the ship, or even complete.  This is a very early test.)<br><br>4. Spawn aliens by pressing the spacebar repeatedly.<br><br>5. Toggle fullscreen mode on and off with F.  See the framerate  by holding TAB.  Quit by pressing ESC.<br><br><br>Pay special attention to the way the ship animates as you move the mouse about.  It rolls from left to right, and the flames even change as you move forward and back.<br><br>Please let me know how the ship controls for you.  I am using the default windows mouse settings, so I set the game up to behave well with those.  <br><br>Also please let me know if you have any performance issues.   There shouldn't be any.  The FPS on my system is around 250 right now. <br><br><br>Btw, for those of you looking for more demos of my sprite systems, this could be considered one.  The demo represents less than five days worth of work, not counting the base application code for handling the stuff like toggling fullscreen, timing, the state system, and the like.  All the gameplay stuff unique to this game was coded from scratch in that time, and it wouldn't have been possible to get it up and running that fast without the sprite system.  At least not in a robust, non-kludgy, way. :-)  <br><br>Enemy and bullet animations are automated by the sprite animation system, while the animation of the stars, space dust, and ship are controlled manually so that I can speed them up and slow them down at will. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But the blink you see there was pretty standard for old style shooters, and I think they even use it in modern games.  Maybe it is just blinking too rapidly.<br><br>The rockets will probably be scaled down a bit, and the firing rate of all the weapons will be limited to varying degrees, so you won't be able to fire 50 rockets like that.  In fact I may  not even include the rocket at all.  <br><br>Also, if I do keep the rocket it would have an acceleration to it instead of just the linear speed it has now, which would make it a bit more interesting.<br><br>I'll consider whether to keep the robot aliens or not.  The only one of those I'm really partial to is Bug3, and that could just be a ship of some kind that flys by and drops powerups or something.  I have a spinning animation for that one as well as the open and close one.  <br><br>The mine will also probably stay.<br><br>I'm a bit hestitant to get rid of any of the aliens though because I have so few of them, and to make matters worse, a number of them look fairly similar.<br><br>As for the background, that was made by me.  I hired an artist to do the 3D stuff, which he's did great job on, but when it came to doing 2D stuff, most of it didn't have the same clean sort of look as the 3D art.  So rather than waste his time asking him to redo it until he got the look I wanted, I just did it myself since it was well within my abilities.  Clean photoshop illustration is my forte. :-)    I'll probably end up doing the fonts too.  <br><br>There's a number of other elements that still need to be added to the background though, like "nebula" cutouts that look like giant versions of the aliens, and smooth blue "dark matter" blobs.

If you use a power of 2 size for your image it will be seamless in that direction.  The images here are 800x2048, so they are seamless vertically.<br><br>The dust is also grayscale so that I can adjust the color by adjusting the sprite color, and it compresses better as a jpeg probably as well.<br><br>The images are not scaled in the game, they're actual size, but you could scale them if you wanted to use a lower res image.<br><br>I scroll the image like so:<br><br><pre class=code>
Position# = Position# + ScrollSpeed#*Time_Delta_Sec#
					
Dust1.SetY(Position# Mod 2048.0 - 300.0 - 1024.0) 
Dust2.SetY(Position# Mod 2048.0 - 300.0 + 1024.0)
</pre><br><br>So there are actually two sprites, one above the other, and they scroll down at a constant rate that I can change. <br><br>It should be noted that everything in my game is attached to a pivot in the center of the screen, so 0,0 is in the center of the screen.<br><br>When the top one scrolls down to the point that the top of it is at the top of the screen, and I've run out of space dust to scroll onto the screen, they both snap upwards 2048 pixels so that the top of the bottom one is at the top of the screen, and then continue scrolling down from there.  Since they are both identical you can't tell that when the transition occurs you're suddenly looking at the second one instead of the first.<br><br>I could have automated the scrolling with my sprite animation system, but I need to be able to stop the scrolling during boss encounters and the like, and having a position value that incremeents as the player makes forward progress allows me to spawn enemies and trigger other things accoridng to how far the player has traveled, rather than just basing it on time which could get a lot more confusing. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'm having some trouble making them consistent regardless of the framerate.<br><br><pre class=code>
Mx# = Mouse_Speed_X# 
My# = Mouse_Speed_Y# 

Vx# = Vx# / (1.0 + Time_Delta_Sec#*Friction#)
Vy# = Vy# / (1.0 + Time_Delta_Sec#*Friction#)
					
Vx# = Vx# + Mx#
Vy# = Vy# + My#
</pre><br><br>								If I just stuck Vx#=Vx#/2.0 in there for example, then the velocity would be cut in half each frame.  This means the ship would slow down a lot faster when it is moving fast, but slow down more slowly as it came to a stop.  This is kinda how it feels now in the demo if you're running around 200fps, and it feels right.  <br><br>But if I turn on vwait, then the framerate drops to 60, and all of a sudden the ship either moves slowly, or jumps to the edge of the screen.  It feels like the mouse acceleration is all screwed up, but it's really just a result of my equations, and I don't know how to solve it yet.<br><br>I tried slowing down the ship at a constant rate, but that didn't feel good at all.  When you go the ship moving fast it took forever to slow down.  <br><br>Maybe if I tweened the current velocity and 0 using the seconds elapsed this frame multiplied by 4 or something as the tween value it would make it consistent.<br><br>Or maybe I will have to implement "ground friction", the slowing down at a constant rate which slows the slow moving ship down quickly, with "air friction" which is exponential and won't stop a slow moving ship fast but does slow down a fast moving ship quickly.  But that's more physics than I really wanted to get into for a simple space shooted and I don't know if it would feel like it is reducing speed in a smooth manner. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So I disabled that too.<br><br>And I modified the video selection code slightly so that it tries to check to see if a 16bit 800x600 mode exists rather than just trying to set the mode, so Big10p if you could try this version on your system...

So that would fail to find a mode, and it would just not let you switch, rather than crashing.<br><br>Maybe there is an issue in the BlitzMAx code itself.  Maybe it itself checks to see if the mode exists before trying to set it.  But that should not cause a crash.

This version also has vwait enabled, and new much simpler ship physics code which feels similar to the old one, but works the same no matter what framerate you're getting, and limits the max speed at which you can move the ship without clamping it so much it's obvious.<br><br>So try this and let me know what you think of the ship's feel Dustin.  I'm pretty happy with it myself.  If I have any less inertia then you won't even be able to tell it has inertia at all.<br><br><a href="http://raccoonrocket.com/blitz/asb-022.zip" target="_blank">http://raccoonrocket.com/blitz/asb-022.zip</a><br><br>Oh and could you tell me what you have your pointer speed set to in windows?  If you don't know where it is, then it is probably set in the middle which is the default.  I don't really think it would affect this new setup at all, but the old setup it might have affected.<br><br>Also, I forgot to mention the controls.  Right click will switch weapons, left click fires, and middle mouse or space will spawn five aliens in the middle.  Tab shows you framerate, but that will probably read 60fps.<br><br>Speaking of framerate, I came up with a method to smooth the framerate out so that it is almost rock solid, only changing once a second or so, but even when I set it on a toggle in the game, I didn't notice ANY difference in smoothness of the motion of objects in the game!  Not even at 20fps, or with vwait disabled.<br><br>So I don't know why everyone was so gung ho a while back about getting their games to run at exactly the monitor's refresh rate.  I looked closely at the big stars the little stars, the ship...  I can see the ghost image the stars leave behind if the framerate is like 30fps, but that is totally unaffected by making the framerate smoother.  I thought it might help a bit but it didn't help at all.  And I didn't see any jittering either.  <br><br>But maybe the diffence in time between each frame being rendered was too small.  The framerate might have been changing, but it might have been changing too little to make  stuff jitter.<br><br>Ps:<br>This version starts fullscreen, so don't bother Big10p. :-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
