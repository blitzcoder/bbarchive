Did the level reset?  Is it a new level?  Perhaps you should not let the player fall off the level, because I was very confused as to what was going on.<br><br>-I kind of think there are too many bubbles to collect.  With the arrow key control scheme, its difficult to get every single bubble.  Perhaps you could do a follow routine, so when you get close to the bubbles they follow you?  (Think Sonic 3 and the lightning powerup)<br><br>-It played a bit choppy at times.  3 Gb RAM, Intel Core Duo 2.10 Mhz, Vista Home 32 bit, (forgot graphics card, nVidia Geforce something... can run BioShock though so its decent).<br><br>-Like the sound and music.<br><br>-Title screen is good.<br><br>-The help file looked funny when I brought it up.  I suggest using plain text format (.txt) or do it in HTML.<br><br>Good job though overall, no bugs (that I could tell) or problems running it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Your game is to easy, the enemies feel like a nuisance more than a threat (Also they tend to get stuck in craters in the level with the different terrains levels) They don't hit hard enough, they dont spawn often enough, and one can just go to the edge of the map, wait for them to accumulate, jump off sacrificing a small amount of health, and they will all follow you down and it will get rid of em. Onto bosses, i don't know if it was intentional, but your first boss would sit around and let me beat the crap out of it for a long while, then all of the sudden go rape mode on me (It was the only time i lost a life) Your second boss let me beat the crap out of it till it was at quarter health before it started to teleport and shoot missiles, which were easily dodgable btw. The final boss's arm would respawn in wierd places (Like behind me when the robot was infront of me) Overall the bosses are a good concept, but need tweaking to provide an actual challenge. Also, i'd advise you to not make the levels loop, its better for a player to try their hardest to get a lot of points in one run through. Also, i could have gone on infinetly in your game, my lives were increasing and my health was WAY over maximum (It took me 6 jumps off the side of the map for my health to be visibly going down, since i had so god d**n much) I would suggest you remove the health recovery power up, and not give extra lives. Lastly, the powerup that lets u shoot a spread of bullets at once is very laggy when you rapid fire. Once some fine tuning is done, im sure this game will be really fun!<br> <br></div><br><br>I agree with this completely after reading it, and would like to know if<br>any of you want to add something to this critique before I begin work<br>on the next version.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>WERDNA <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This is fine, but for your game to really be appreciated today, it needs to really look stellar.  Particle effects, stereo sound, etc.  In todays gaming world with short attention spans, these are crucial.<br><br>However, you may be trying to create a more Action/Adventure style game.  In this case, you need to add more to the game than just collecting balls.  Some sort of in depth storyline, puzzle solving, or a strategic aspect.  Perhaps rather than a ton of enemies, have fewer, stronger, and above all else, smarter enemies.  Work on solid AI that requires the player to think about how to conquer enemies.<br><br>In short, your game is in a No Mans Land when it comes to genre, and I think this should be sorted out so you can "fill out" the game gameplay wise.<br><br>I hope that makes sense. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
