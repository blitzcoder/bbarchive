You don't need to know Dutch to play them, from left to right it is: asteroids, mario, memory, shooter and street fighter (not too good though).

Absolutely <i>atrocious</i> -- for that age range having a Dutch command set is a ridiculous hindrance rather than a help.... Not sure how younger students would perceive it.<br><br>I realize that the goal is probably to deemphasise the syntax in favor of the concept of programming. The problem is that pretty much everyone with even a passing interest in programming will already have been exposed to programming languages with an English command set, and the Dutch translation just comes across as really contrived.<br>Since the language itself is not normally the problem (since pretty much everyone would already know the English translations of the commands in question) you're not really adding any help, but just adding a layer of needless complication by introducing grammatically questionable dutch into the mix. Personally I absolutely hated that Dutch pascal thing with a passion, and the entire thing was considered a big joke in school.<br><br>Having an English command set has the added benefit that it's much easier to switch to a <i>real</i> programming language for those students who truly are interested in programming after their introduction course.<br><br>Even now, 15 years later, I still clearly remember how utterly <i>stupid</i> the concept of a Dutch programming language was perceived by the students, including myself. But who knows, maybe it's different for a younger target audience... Just don't expect to be taken seriously <i>at all</i> by older students.<br><br>Good luck, anyway. :-? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But a majority of the students still felt uncomfortable using English, and they specifically requested a Dutch language. For me, it was easy enough to translate it, since all keywords are a const list in a separate module. And oh well, we have a Dutch version of Windows as well, so I figured: why not ? Converting the helpfiles turned out to be quite a tedious job. <br>The original version of this script language is English, but for now, I have no plans with it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
