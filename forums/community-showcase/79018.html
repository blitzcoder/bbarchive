I have recently purchased BlitzMax, and wow is it different. I think it will take me too long to re-write the whole thing on my own, so I wondered if anyone else would like a piece of the action. <br><br>Check out the Lexicod Website.<br><a href="http://www.lexicod.co.uk" target="_blank">Click here!</a><br><br>I have one publisher very interested, but they are interested in the mobile phone gaming market and are correct in thinking there is still a lot to be done. A BB .exe cannot go straight onto a phone. <br><br>Anyway, take a look at the game. All I have to offer is the .exe for now - the source went missing along with the rest of the partition it was on, but I do have it backed up......somewhere......<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2010</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The problem with the window was if you tried to close it with the Cross Top Right the program froze, no, the whole computer froze, sometimes BSODing. I wrote a fast exit system for it calling it QuickBossExit, so I could continue writing it at work and while testing it could make it disappear immediately - recognising the potential added value of this for other office layabout players.<br><br>My main concern is that having bought the full version of b2d, then finding it was no longer current - within this web community anyway - I very recently bought BMax. I find Bmax cannot even run my old b2d source code - I have a steep hill to climb now learning BMax, and re-writing all of my games.<br>I see the great improvements BMax has to offer, and I don't regret paying a princely sum for it. I am just disappointed that it is so radically changed. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
