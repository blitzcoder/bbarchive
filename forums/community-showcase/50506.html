You may connect using GNET, direct connection, and localhost.<br><br>There is a readme explaining the multiplayer connection process and live help by typing "help" ingame.  It's not complex, but it is different to other games in the way that connectivity works.<br><br>basically<br>1. start the game<br>2. type, "name yourName"<br><br>to start a server<br>3. type, "start server"<br>4. type, "auto"<br><br>to join a server<br>3. type "list"<br>4. type "server 1" or "server 2" etc etc...<br><br>Firewall users may like to know that the default connection is on TCP using port 8082, although the port can be reconfigured from the ingame console.<br><br>To start a race the server host types 'race'.  You can change the length of the race before you begin by choosing the number of buoys to race around (max: 20), 'length 20'.<br><br>If you crash you can reset with the 'reset' command in multiplayer, but this will automatically retire you from the race after the first minute.<br><br>Currently race positions are only reported locally, but chat works so you can moan about your race position to your mates ;).<br><br>Regrettably NTL cable modem users may have difficulty with GNET as NTL make you use a gateway which confuses the service.  You will need to use direct connection to be a serer, but you can connect as a client normally.<br><br>The game has forums to arrange races which are acessible from within the game. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The water system is fully localised.  You can enter a channel that has a rough entry from a seabed overfall or a few rocks that opens into a tidal river that opens out into a calm lake...  In actuality i've used a few simple tricks to achieve the effect but the result is a sea state that - if I toned the waves down a bit - is actually suprisingly realistic in what it simulates.<br><br><div class="quote"> You should make it so that there is fog which gradually increases towards the camera range <br></div><br>I hate fog.  It was introduced as a cheep trick to hide short drawing distances on early 3D games, and it's still a cheap trick.  Admittedly in this project I actually am not drawing that far, but that's not the point!  Cheap is cheap...<br><br>It's like lenseflare, which is such an accepted part of gameplay in current games but has absolutely no basis in real life what-so-ever, but when it's absent everybody says, "it'd be more realistic if you added lenseflare..."<br><br>What I actually need to do is increase the drawdistance and use the fog to blend the distant landscape to a slightly darker colour than the sky to make a "haze" rather than a fog, which i might be able to do with a bit of trickery pockery.<br><br><div class="quote"> It's scary when you get out to open sea and dont know how to come back!!

I soon will though *grrrr*. &gt;:¬/<br><br><div class="quote"> Do you have any tips on getting it faster than 6 kts? <br></div><br><br>Yes, there are a number of factors which control your speed.<br><br>Firstly you need to know that the speed given is your speed through the water only, and that the water is also moving so the speed shown does not factor your "over ground" speed.  If you run with a strong current you can get another 6 kts ot so that aren't displayed.<br><br>Secondly you also need to know that in the latest version the wind bearing and strength changes.  In a strong wind, on a good tack with the right sail setting it is possible to achieve about 16kts through the water, other times you'll be stuck in irons.<br><br>If your heading in a given direction and the wind is against you then you need to tack across wind, when the wind is on the nose no amount of sail control will capture any wind in the sail, the more wind you get in the sail, the faster you go.<br><br>This bring us up to the last and most important point of all.  Get your sail flat to the wind.  If you have your sail too tight you are missing out on potential wind and if it's too loose and flapping about then it's not doing you any good either.<br><br>In the perfect world you would know exactly where the point is where if you let the sail out anymore it would start flapping about.  Of course, you dont know where that point is until it starts flapping - therefore most sailors work on the following principle:<br><br>Keep a little tiny itsy witsy bit of eeny weenie flapping going on at the very edges of your sails.  This shows you are right next to the perfect angle, if you get it any more perfect and the wind changes direction you may end up with your sails too tight and not notice - so keeping the slightest bit of slack there lets you know your on the very edge.<br><br>To do this requires almost constant small adjustments as you continually modify your tack in search of more speed in relation to your destination (relativity is important because quite often in sailing you dont sail to your target because of the wind), and as a consequence then make small adjustmets your sail position.<br><br>There just isn't a way to find a sweet spot and keep it there for long, and that is half the challenge of sailing at high speed.  At some point, your going to be doing less than your potential maximum, and that point is a constant known as "all the time".<br><br>With regards to wind: In addition to the global wind direction and bearing the sea surface colour also changes to show differentials in local weather.  Darker patches of sea appear where there is more wind, and lighter patches appear where there is less wind. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
