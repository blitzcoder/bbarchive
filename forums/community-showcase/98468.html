So technically, it's a BlitzMax app :).<br><br>So here's a little shooter game that i've been kinda working on and off with in the past couple months. Its basically a "minimalistic 360 degrees polarity arena wave shooter". The game is simple, you just shoot everything, grab the diamonds, get more points. No pattern or anything, just straight shooting. There are two types of enemies, Gold and Silver and you can switch your "bullet mode" between Gold and Silver. <br><br>Shooting the enemy with the matching bullet color will destroy it quicker, get higher points, and spawn a "diamond" to collect for more points. Collect 15 diamonds will yield an extra energy cell. Destroy all the enemies on screen before the timer is up will get you bonus points based on the time remaining. So shoot away and survive each wave as long as you can  ! Use bombs when things get too hectic, but keep in mind you lose an energy per use. <br><br><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/32818518/downloads/tevada/screens/tevada1.png"><br><br><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/32818518/downloads/tevada/screens/tevada5.png"><br><br><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/32818518/downloads/tevada/screens/tevada6.png"><br><br><b>Controls :</b><br>AWSD - Left, Up, Down, Right<br>Left Mouse Button - Shoot!<br>Right Mouse Button - Switch Bullet Color Mode between Gold and Silver<br>Space Bar - Bomb!<br><br><b>Download</b><br><a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/32818518/downloads/tevada/files/Tevada_1.2beta.zip" target="_blank">(win) Teveda Trigger 1.2 beta - 4.4mb</a><br><a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/32818518/downloads/tevada/files/Tevada_1.2betaMAC.zip" target="_blank">(mac) Teveda Trigger 1.2 beta - 4.6mb</a><br><br><b>Note</b> : The first two waves are purposely easy to get the player prepared for the incoming chaos in the next few levels. <br><br>Thanks all!<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I was planning on using vector graphics to depicts the Tevadas (angels) battling it out in the wars of the Devas (gods) and Asuras (devils). The plot was to rescue all the <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Danseuses_kmer_%282%29.JPG" target="_blank"> Apsaras</a> (celestial heavenly dancers) from the Asuras and return to back to Angkor Wat :).
