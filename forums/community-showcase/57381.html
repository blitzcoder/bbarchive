Runs smoothly. Love the graphics and absolutely adore the little red guys when they get angry. That's just brilliant.<br><br>I didn't realize at first that you could jump higher by doing a jump-kick instead of just a jump, so had trouble getting on top of one of the platforms till I realized this. The character slides quite a bit which I don't like, but maybe that's just me being an anal animator :-). I got stuck when I walked of the edge just beyond the first palmtree, and couldn't jump or do anything other than walkl left or right inside the ground. Also, there was something weird happening with the camera from time to time. It goes in and out which is cool, but sometimes it seemed to snap very close in on the character for like 1 frame. Didn't know quite what it was and didn't manage to repeat it consequently. Other than that very cool work.<br><br>Looking forward to seeing the completed version.<br><br>  Ragnar <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You asked for my opinion, and I could be dead wrong, so forget it and go ahead! follow your dreams. :-)<br><br> I have no special talent to guess what sells thousands per month or what does not sell a copy a month. I could never predict the next big shareware/comercial  seller. So take what I tell you a grain of salt (as everything you read on the Internet).<br><br> The chances of any of us "getting rich" or even "earn a living" writing a single indie game are about "0" to "none" in my opinion... based or reading a lot on the Internet and talking to a lot of authors... <br><br> The changes of "living out of indie games" are greater if: <br><br> - you write some titles (read have several ones generating sales simultaneously), which takes years to achieve, and a lot of "not so enthusiastic periods". Finishing and polishing a game that you thought was 80% done will be a whole lot harder than you might think. <br><br> -  don't quit your day job or get one (whichever applies to your case).<br><br> - learn from your mistakes and be realistic on what you can produce. Do not even imagine you will get a nintendo style triple AAA quality, hugely  polished title. Make it as fast as you can, make sure you have the energy to finish it, wrap it (i.e. showing the strong points of whatever you produce) and sell it. Most people aim for the moon, that's crazy, and a lot of unfinished titles are the evidence. Check out the gallery right here... and imagine what happened to a lot of those "great" games behind the pretty screenshots.<br><br> - Have a lot of luck, a lot of talent, or both. Yes there is nothing "amazing" technically speaking on some of the computer games industry best sellers. Testing and inventing concepts creates more "winners" when things work than writing the best implementation on a old idea (the bet of the games industry in the past 10 years or so). You can follow either road, rewrite whatever sells "plus some cherry on top", or invent something new (try, fail, retry, fail again, prototype, test concepts, and maybe, just maybe... you'll have the next Tetris, Lemmings, wolfenstein in your hands). <br><br> - Last but not least. Have fun. Make it a hobby you love. If it turns out that your hobby makes you (some or a lot) money it is great. You are a lot more likely to be a failure than a success as an indie. So you better love every project, make sure you have the energy stored for when things are not all that exciting, when code grows and starts to gain its own life and then comes back to haunt you... prototype, iterate, test stuff. Drop what does not work, or is not fun, pursue with a vengeance what does work in your prototype, forget everything else and focus on what is fun, different, and can makes your product stand out and a some sort of a chance to compete.<br><br> ... I have been writing unfinished games since 1991, some were released as shareware... TotalWar 1 &amp; 2 (Amiga), Universal wars (Amiga &amp; PC bbs doors, for Xenolink and pcboard) and now I *will* finish and release"Su Doku Live". A lot of other projects failed... they were no fun, or got to ambitious for me to handle them, or I just tired of the idea or got drained of the energy required to finish them. Loving it. As much as I did 15 years ago. And no, none of them sold anything worth mentioning, even when I thought they would.<br><br> Most people that I know that wrote games got nowhere and quitted just out of sheer disappointment with sales. Well, I think they forgot rule #1: love it and do it for the fun... add the remote chance of actually earning money as the salt we need in food and in our dreams.<br><br> PLS <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I thought y'all should know as I'm almost definitely putting the game on the shelf for the time being...<br><br>Quote:<br>============================================<br><br>Thanks for the honest and useful comments everyone. I really appreciate you taking your time to advise me.<br><br>I feel I should give some background to myself and this project...<br><br>I am a full-time, pro music producer and DJ, and have been in that industry for over ten years.<br><br>In my childhood, I was a very keen programmer, and released several titles for the Amiga in my teens. I began with simple freeware games, and moved on to what was my biggest project to date: a 2d point'n'click, Monkey-Island style game called 'Keith's Quest' (look it up if you like - it's available on some abandonware sites). The was classified Licenseware (the bracket slightly more expensive than shareware). It was a two year project, one of which was totally devoted to the game. I was lucky in that I had a spare year to devote to it, unlucky in that, by the time I released, the Amiga was on its last legs (c.1995), and sales were severely down.<br><br>Anyway, I'm mentioning this to show that I have the necessary in me to finish a large project (I have also finished a couple of music albums and a book - I tend to see things through once I have begun).<br><br>I know this is a risky genre, and producing a AAA platformer title is a very high aim for my first project, however, I would be prepared to put in the time if I really thought my idea had potential. Obviously the pre-alpha I have released is in no state to show off, but to even get it to the beta stage would require several more months of debugging / level-writing and playtesting. <br><br>I needed to know if it's even worth reaching that point. I perhaps did upload too early, however I don't know if I have the time in my life to commit unless I believed that, like me, the other indie developers thought I had something quite cool on my hands.<br><br>I am at a stage in my life where I would quite like a career change, and I know I have it in me to write some decent games, as it is my biggest love besides music, and I have the necessary experience and the technical knowledge (I have a degree in Comp. Science. from a decent uni.)<br><br>Now I am thinking I should follow the crowd and try a title with the scope of a match-3 (which by the way I am really fed-up with!) in order to make the funds available for a project I'd really like to do. I wouldn't make a match-3 itself, just a title with the same level of simplicity, as it [sadly] seems to be the only sure-fire way to make a living. I felt that this attitude was damaging the indie scene, as no-one was brave enough to attempt something different, but now I'm moving towards the opinion that - if you can't beat 'em up, join 'em up (sorry, bad joke). At least until I can fund a project like this. <br><br>I have several 'mini' game ideas, one of which has been in the works since about '92 and my brothers and I still play. This might be the kind of thing I need to get started on... Build up my company's profile to the point where I can get a team together for a bigger project like this.<br><br>So chances are, this will get shelved (something I really dislike to do) until such time as I can feel more secure in devoting two years to it (I had planned to take as much time as was needed - it took the best part of 4 months to get the game and tools to this point.)<br><br>Thanks everybody for getting back to me, I really appreciate your feedback. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The only real criticism would be that you maybe should have done a little more internal testing and ironed out a few more of the obvious bugs before releasing it for public consumption.<br><br>I think it would benefit hugely from getting some joypad support in their as soon as possible and just nailing a couple of the key things, such as ensuring the player can't fall through the floor etc.<br><br>I think it's great style wise and both my girlfriend and her 8 year old son loved the look of it. Callum asked when he could have it on his PC too..<br><br>Keep at it mate! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
