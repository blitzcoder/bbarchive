Pull it back and make the field of view wider so we can see more of the game world as we drive.<br><br>- It's silly that vehicles drive through water. I drove through a lake and saw 4 other vehicles driving along the bottom. Computer AI should avoid water; player vehicle should stall out and need to be "reset" if you crash into a lake.<br><br>- One of my favorite games in this genre was "Monster Truck Madness" by Microsoft back in the 90's. <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/games/monster/screenshots.htm" target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com/games/monster/screenshots.htm</a> You could pretty much free drive all over a large map in a big 4x4 truck. Climbing hills and catching air had a tangible feel of "weight" to the vehicle, something I don't sense in your game. Perhaps more impact and bounce upon landing after large jumps would help?<br><br>- Along the lines of physics, I would add weight to the front of vehicles...not much, but just enough to change the way the vehicle travels through the air. If you watch videos of vehicles jumping they almost ALWAYS tend to "nose down" in the air, at least in lower-velocity jumps. Your vehicles tend to jump more like motorcycles- nearly always landing on their rear wheels.<br><br>Just my 2 cents after a few minutes of play. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I just wanted to go and I had to change the control scheme more than 5 times before I gave up and started testing the other vehicles out.  It just doesn't really suit the game which has very intuitive controls in the other vehicles.  I just want to move around and up and down.  I guess you might have been going for a Battlefield thing but that game was very realistic so it felt right to make the copter somewhat complex.  With this game though it just felt frustrating with no real feeling that it would be worth getting better at.

This way you can move forward and back or strafe on the keys and then turn with the mouse.  Also you could use one mouse button to shoot and another to elevate.  That would be very easy especially for PC gamers who are used to these sort of controls.<br><br>I understand wanting to be different but different controls are a poor way to innovate.  You want to innovate with the theme of the game or the tactics behind the gameplay but not with the way that people interface with the game ... unless you're creating all new hardware like the Wii.  <br><br>If players are used to using a mouse and keyboard one way then there's already the expectation for it to work.  If it doesn't work then they get annoyed right off the bat.  When you're making a game there are enough challenges to make it fun and long lasting.  There's no reason to add that challenge as well.<br><br>Just detach yourself from the controls you're used to and also from any really young players (aka the 5 year old) because they don't have expectations.  You'll want to sell this to people who play PC games and have credit cards.<br><br>I think you've got a chance to make this a very popular game for the crowd that bought Think Tanks.  Their target audience was people who grew up playing the early 3D games but are now too busy to play the super hardcore games so they created a casual core game.  Something you can jump into quick and get a real gameplay experience.  This Polymaniacs is better though because it has more vehicles and character as well as the flat shaded polygon aesthetic which will ring true for anyone who played early 3D games like Virtua Fighter, Hard Drivin', Star Fox, etc...<br><br>Just keep your goal in mind, other people having fun (and paying you for it) ;)  Don't let anything get you down.  There's no way to make a game perfect without lots and lots of iteration and play testing.  It's been reported that Nintendo builds their games and upward of 3 times from scratch before releasing them.  It's not that Miyamoto is such a genius that he nails it the first time out, it's that he doesn't give up in the engineering process of the game.  Just keep plugging away until most people are giving you good feedback with no regrets. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I personally found the helicopter controls to be intuitive, perfectly satsifactory, and consistent with the rest of the game and/or vehicles.  It was because of this latter point that I found it so easy to work out which buttons to push, after playing the land-based vehicles.  Compared to a land-based vehicles, helicopters aren't meant to be as straightforward to control.  That being said, it's not at all difficult (my 5yr old son enjoyed very much blowing my poor lil Humvee away repeatedly) and the relative lack of control combined with supreme firepower helps make it fun.<br><br>If it adds at all to my credibility, I play PC games and have credit cards.  ;o) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The new analog controls are great.  The copter is now perfect.  It's manageable and yet still feels like you're on the verge of disaster.  It's just enough to be fun.  It reminds me of the warthog in Halo (on Xbox).  It's very fun to drive and it's controllable but it slips and slides like it has some real power.<br><br>I'm really looking forward to this game.  One thing you must do though is allow the menus to be navigated with the keyboard and mouse or the joystick without taking your hands off whatever input device you're using.    One great thing we came up with for Aerial Antics was the use of a letter dial that can be used to enter names etc... It works just as well on an analog pad as it does with a mouse and avoids having to use the keyboard although you could just as easily allow all 3 input devices to then enter text.<br><br>I still need to get my buddy over here to play but I just moved so maybe next week.
