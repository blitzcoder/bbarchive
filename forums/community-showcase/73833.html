I am uncertain if I will have quests of any sort yet. My ultimate goal, though, is to make several locations in the game, such as pubs or arenas, where other players connected to the internet will be there also. I think an arena would be very nice, with players given the ability to combat one another. I dream on though, with networking, aside from 3D coding and applying proper sound and music to my games, is the thing I am worst at. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
