It's still very basic but these new improvements make it quite fun.<br><br>DOWNLOAD IT HERE: <a href="http://www.greyaliengames.com/aotmg/aotmg045a.zip" target="_blank">http://www.greyaliengames.com/aotmg/aotmg045a.zip</a> (5.43Mb)<br><br>Intel Mac version here: <a href="http://www.greyaliengames.com/aotmg/AOTMG045.dmg" target="_blank">http://www.greyaliengames.com/aotmg/AOTMG045.dmg</a> (Double click the disk image to open it, then make a folder on your desktop and drag the contents of the disk image into it.  Then click AOTMG to run it).<br><br>Try to beat all 10 levels and score over 20,000.  I did so it's possible.<br><br>How can you tell that this game is Vista compatible?  Well it switches to the OpenAL Sound Driver (press D to bring up the Debug stats and check) because the FreeAudio one isn't so good.  Also, if you log onto Vista as another user the game profiles will still all be there and the high scores will be properly shared - many games do NOT have this capability in Vista due to User Account Control virtualising the file writes and reads.<br><br>If you have 98 or ME, the default FreeAudio isn't so good (it seems fine in most XP setups) so try bringing up the Debug stats and pressing H until you change to DirectSound or OpenAL Generic Software.  Then exit the game with Ctrl+X and reload to get the sounds back otherwise it may crash when it next tries to play a sound.<br><br>Enjoy!  (This isn't a "proper" game, it's a tech demo so I don't need any "playability" feedback ;-) but I do need to know about any errors or anomalies, thanks!)<br><br><img src="http://www.greyaliengames.com/aotmg/V045a.jpg"> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Just missed out on the 20,000 with a score of 19,110 on level 10.<br><br>For the Mac version you should really include all the data/media within the application bundle itself, as this is generally how it's done on that system.  Still keep high scores, etc, in the Shared User folder though (don't know if this is where you store save data, as I haven't tried the Mac version).  I've just figured out how to do this and it isn't too difficult.  Obviously no biggie here, as it's a demo of your framework.  I'll probably do a How To later on today for anyone else that wants to include the data within the bundle, as it will also be especially useful for those creating Universal Binaries.<br><br>Also, I noticed that you only had a 48x48 icon.  Vista really needs a larger 256x256 icon to be included as well.  Again, probably doesn't really matter in this case.<br><br>Overall, good job and everything appears to be working as it should.

To be honest, I'm not bothered about allowing the user to change sound driver MID-GAME, that's just over the top (congrats if your games do!).  I'm content that they have to reload the game.  I've got dynamic graphics driver changing and screen mode changing as Bmax handles that automatically which is cool.<br><br>Oh btw, the Mac version above should exhibit a current BMax bug where changing to and from windowed mode screws up all the graphics completely!

Running from the HD or desktop works fine. However, *usually* most games will run directly from the disk image itself without requiring it to be put into the applications folder or whatever. Your game does `run` but it comes up with a message saying it can't write an ini file. The path it's trying to write to is presumably within the DMG disk and not on the real harddrive. Just something to consider. Also you probably should not have a data folder alongside the .app unless you're going to put both of them into an enclosing folder, otherwise the user has to create a folder to keep both in the same place.<br><br>As to your framework itself, you have improved and tweaked it nicely. The game is more impressive with lots more objects onscreen and your explosions and sound effects are much better. Everything worked correctly and once I figured out to hold down the Z key instead of pressing it many times suddenly proved to make it very easy to progress; -D<br><br>Everything seemed to work fine with regards to prefs and options, except for when switching to or from windowed mode. This *TOTALLY* screwed with your graphics. I can't even begin to describe what happens to your visuals when switching between those modes. ... Well, to give some idea, many image textures are lost, resulting in various pieces of the GUI etc becoming white instead of textured. There is some kind of crazy thing which goes on with the buffers, etc. Changing between screens within the game while remaining in windowed mode seems to for the most part restore most of the images but not all of them. It's pretty wierd.<br><br>I am not sure whether you can trust that when you switch between full and windowed modes the graphics will all be retained. It was my understanding at some point in BlitzMax's past that it was not able to retain any images in videoram when you close the screen or window, because it loses the OpenGL context and thus all textures. This *seems* to be what is happening, because switching between modes seems to give you `leftover` graphics and missing image data, as if you were accidentally referencing parts of video ram which are now partly overwritten or whatever. Unless someone can say for sure that Max is supposed to be able to retain all image data after an EndGraphics(), I think I would personally re-upload all texture data (images) upon opening a new display.<br><br>See below 9 screens which occurred after swapping between full and windowed and back. You get different corruption each time. As you can in some of the shots the mouse pointer graphic is actually taking the place of the backdrop image in the menu! This is not a bug in your code, I think it is more likely the effect of texture references getting lost and confused and using old references which are disassociated from their proper texture data.<br><br><img src="http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y42/Angeldaniel/AOTMG-Screens.jpg"> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You used to be able to swap screens in BMax 1.24 no probs but BRL has broken it in 1.26 and as JazzieB says, I'm just waiting for the update.  If it's not soon, then I'll apply the fix myself. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
