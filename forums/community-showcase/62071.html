There aren't any "noob users" on Win2k as you won't be able to use it that good if you came from Win98 because it works differently with right management etc. (that was quite simplified for WinXP or just removed in Home).<br>And to me, an officially abandoned OS which does not get any support anymore is dead. Why? Systems that use those because they don't meet the min. req for XP don't qualify as target platform for BM anyway as their GPU just is too weak. BM does not optionally need 3D hardware support, it is the most important must have part (unlike the old Blitz)<br><br>Neuro: Yes you are right, there are gov etc that use old Windows version. But sorry, those aren't the regular target market for anything created with Blitz, are they?<br>Just because there is something, this does not mean much to "will they be interested". The same goes for BM games ... either you use OpenGL in which case most are out anyway or you use DX7 in which case most users that were forced to Win98 are out again as well as their GPU is too crappy for real 3D. So no mather how you see it, they are out until you switch back to Blitz Plus / Blitz3D. There is no way around and one of the major things BM users should perhaps start to realize.<br><br>Their games NEED a 3D cards, its no optional requirement as with BlitzPlus and Blitz3D. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
