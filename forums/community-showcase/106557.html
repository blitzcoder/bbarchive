The game at the moment has poor artwork just passable, and game scenarios could be setup.<br><br>It does have problems its confined to 800x600 pixels , but stretched to fit screen is just passable, its not possible to change this, the program is hard coded to 800x600 and the chits are only 25x25 pixels also hard coded( the art is more challenging with low def, you can see other game with good art desigh like TacOps by battlefront) the game has 27 boards and 30 unit artwork per board but can have many more copies of chits on one board.<br><br>I would be happy to share this project with you? its on gamejolt.com   at   <a href="http://gamejolt.com/profile/gameleaper/1574540/games" target="_blank">http://gamejolt.com/profile/gameleaper/1574540/games</a>   its called WarTac. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I was learning blitz when I programed it and it went through many redo's believe me you will look at it and think how does it work, but I got away with it and it runs, eg I started with the idea of a chit on the screen with no info about the chit, then after working I needed more info so I created another 800x600 invisible screen, then needed more info and I think I did 7 virtual screens it became to late to change, and you will hate the code, but if you can withstand the shock it worked, and you can just about figure it out. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you are able to find out what a code is doing, then you surely rewrite it in a way that it follows the coders style/thinking.<br><br>Ok, if the function is doing 10 different things and quirks like "fixing" flaws of another function, then it might be more a "reusing a function" and "rewriting it later".<br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
