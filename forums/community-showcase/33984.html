So far, four of the six are complex. I've made some minor changes to the environments, but I've also completely redone the lighting of all the levels, including optimized lightmapping. Higher Quaity, less wasteful textures, etc.<br><br>Just got character shadows working properly now. Thanks to SSwift for helping me out with a couple of issues there. I've a few ideas to make shadows even faster, but I'll leave that for now. Soft shadows work too, but I like the crisp shadows in this game.<br><br>Six full length music tracks are being completed for the game, two of which are already complete. Either this is going to be cd only or there will be a deluxe version, because six music tracks in .ogg format is going to be too big for download-only.<br><br>I've also been working on a beta multiplayer. Hard to test because my own PC crashes when trying to test multiplayer, but my girlfriend's PC runs them perfectly. Not sure if that's the fault of my code or something screwy with Windows. Mutliplayer was never an intended feature, and most bowling games don't seem to have it, but I expect to add it as a free patch after the initial release. Better to release the multiplayer as a bonus freebie than to detract from the main game with buggy multiplayer which wasn't really part of the design anyway. Still, it does seem quite reliable on my gf's PC, so it should be fun.<br><br>I've also ID'd the slowdowns on sub 1Ghz PC's. It's simply that Blitz is having trouble with a 6,000 poly model with skeletal animation. I've a few ideas to "mask" the problem, but fortunately the new character models are lower detail anyway. Between 3,000 and 4,500 polys mostly, so that should help a bit.<br><br>Enough waffle ( too much, you say? ) <br><br>Quick Render showing all 6 characters.

It seems silly to cut out detail when there's only going to be one character on screen at a time. Also, since it's likely to end up being CD only, the minimum requirements need not be so low.<br><br>I think I can optimize in other areas without compromising on the models.

The second shot is artificially light at the moment, because that scene has very little light. It's like when they use huge spotlights on actors in night scenes in films. It might not look natural, but you wouldn't see anything if it was. I've tried playing with grey and blue-grey lights to match the environment a little more, but it doesn't look good. I will play with the lights more, but I don't think it's unreasonable to have the characters lit up in an after dark sport.<br><br>There is a fault line. Not particularly distinct, but since you're not directly controlling the player, you don't have to manually avoid it.<br><br>More life, eh? I've been trying for a very quiet atmosphere for all the alleys. Sort of like a private alley, deserted car park, abandoned building site, things like that. It's a casual game. People don't generally bowl to a crowd of hooting onlookers. I'm not trying to create a tournament bowling game, very much a relaxed game. And Blitz isn't going to let me add any more animated characters anyway.<br><br>Plants are a good idea though. If I could model plants, they'd look good in the first alley. Have to see what I can find on the cheap, since my budget is running low. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Certainly it would be appealing to a certain market, but it's putting myself in a bit of a niche market to go that far. I was really aiming for something along the lines of Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball, not really heavily stylized. Plus I'm not a manga fan, so I would probably end up making a bad job of it, alienating the only market it would appeal to. I do think some particle effects are necessary to give it a less realistic feel and I'll be working on those soon.<br><br>I do agree with you about the problems of these type of sports games. I can't go as overboard on the physics as I would like, because Tokamak is biased heavily towards realism over fun physics. I've already had to make a lot of additions myself to make the physics more fun and a little less realistic. Still the physics have to be consistent and the collisions need to be realistic and accurate.<br><br>One of the alleys does have a couple of jumps and one is slightly pipe shaped, allowing the ball to roll up the sides somewhat. Whether my already-modified Tokamak physics will stretch to flying balls and explosions, I really don't know. They're a good jumping off point though, and I have some ideas I can add for challenge/arcade modes. They will be player-controlled only though, as they wouldn't really suit the AI I'm working on.<br><br>I'm adding some learning AI so that the CPU players actually learn to play better by watching you ( or other CPU players ) play and learning the techniques. They don't just copy the shots outright, but they will attempt to emulate your technique and the results will vary according to their skill level.<br><br>As a lil test, I played a game against the CPU last night on easy mode. I score 197 and the CPU on the easiest difficulty scored 93. Even allowing for the fact that I've played the game quite a lot, I probably need to make the AI slightly harder and the player controls slightly more difficult. Still, it's coming along nicely and learning AI will make it more fun, I think. That way it will be playing slightly differently on every computer.<br><br><br>Sinu: Yup. Exactly what I was thinking. Been running through some ideas while I took a walk down by the river this afternoon. I'm keen to start working on them now. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
