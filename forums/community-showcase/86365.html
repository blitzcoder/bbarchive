The engine will just become more refined from version to<br>version. Several of the bugs from the first version were removed in this<br>one, and in the third version(Hopefully), all the bugs from this one will<br>be removed as well.<br><br>Also I found out whats wrong with the story, lol.<br>My story ends on line 24.<br>There is a 3 second delay in between each line.<br>Even though the story <i> ends </i> on line 24, the program still passes<br>through the next 6 lines before you reach the Wait key that lets you<br>end the story. So thats several seconds that you have to wait before<br>you can do anything.<br>Also the waitkey itself is faulty, and the only way to pass it is to hold<br>down spacebar AND hit any key WHILE holding down spacebar.<br>Although you can skip the story entirely if you just hold spacebar to<br>begin with. So this definitely needs to be fixed, and I think I'll just<br>upload a new 'fixed' version tomorrow :)<br><br>WERDNA <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So I made a<br>lot of board games using cardboard, and colored pencils.<br> All of my games were very unique, and as can be expected more<br>resembled video games.(In the way they were played)<br>Out of all of these, the one that I like very best, and to this day view<br>as the best board game I've ever played, is one called Across the Land.<br>It was one of the few good one player board games I've ever played,<br>and that is because it resembles very heavily your typical Dragon Warrior\Final Fantasy video game.<br> Using some rather clever ideas, I managed to make a board game that<br>had turn based battles, random enemy encounters, a shop, different<br>status ailments such as confusion, poison, paralysis, sleep, etc, and <br>took about 2 hours to win :)<br>I use to wake up 2 hours early sometimes just so I had time to play it.<br><br>And several months ago, I decided to recreate it on the computer.<br>So as you can see above, I scanned in the original board.<br>Along with all of the monsters which I used Yu-Gi-Oh cards to represent.<br>But I can't upload it to filefront, since it <i> does </i> use Yu-Gi-Oh cards<br>for the monster images.(Copy right infringement:)<br><br>So the game has sat in a near state of completion for months, because<br>I've been to busy(And inept in the art department) to make my own<br>monsters.<br><br>Well I finally decided to get around to it, and have 3 done so far, so<br>hopefully I'll be able to upload the game soon.<br><br>Until then, I won't be able to offer any kind of demo unfortunately :(<br>(On a side note, if you think the code in P.U.K.I is bad, you should see<br>the horror of across the land. The code file is nearly 400K.)<br><br><br>And finally as previously stated, I'll upload a new, 'fixed' version of P.U.K.I<br>at some point today :)<br><br><br>Glad everyones enjoying it!<br><br>WERDNA <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
