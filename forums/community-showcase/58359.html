But we arn't static, the most static state would be death. :D<br>And even then, there are states after death (consumption of our corpse! ;) )<br><br>I don't really define it as "human" intelligence, more likely I just define it as intelligence, which would in this context, be an entity that can predict the future based on learned patterns of the past. Human intelligence is a much more broad and complex subject which has even higher level than the internals of intelligence itself (I would call it an art :D ). Though ofcoarse, there are many other parts of the brain that deal with "human" intelligence!<br><br>Check that book out if you can, a relaxing read! :)<br>Not made to be complex, and he gives great real world examples of his framework and theory. :D<br><br>I don't really like to look at intelligence from a programmers perspective, a programmer defines intelligence by its behavior, input goes into &lt;black box&gt;, output comes out of &lt;black box&gt;. Programmers are missing a very important part of the intelligence theory, in that we are still intelligent without showing any behavior, we are still thinking in a dark quiet room.<br><br>But thanks for the comment Mike :D , in theory you can define any state in the universe with a program. I even feel that the universe is a computer processing states. (I'm a finite state/cellular automata fan :D) And as such, I feel that anything in this universe, could in itself be calculated with a Turing Complete system. So I'm not saying your ideas are impossible, as is, anything is possible with an open-mind. :)<br><br>Another good book to read, that's based on your ideas is by Ray Kurzweil, - The Singularity Is Near : When Humans Transcend Biology, some people call him a nut, but I enjoy his ideas. He believes we are just in a universal computer, and our goal is to propagate towards building our own universal computer.<br><br>Anyway, I just really want to see intelligence in computers. :( <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
