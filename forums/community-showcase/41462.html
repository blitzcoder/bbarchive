It was a platformer where you could aim with the mouse and move with the keys. I can't remember exactly how complete it was, but it was really cool. I think it was called "Abuse" or something. Maybe that was a similar commercial game.<br><br>Another one is a 2D overhead shooter that wasn't fully developed when I played it. It was multiplayer, set in a warehouse, where you could explode barrels and stuff. Kinda vague, yeah, but some people might remember.<br><br>Any suggestions for games similar to this or anything else in 2D is helpful. I remember there was a game called "platypus" with really good art that was cool too. I am checking out Alien Breed right now. I've checked out blitzcoder, but there's so much content that it's hard to sort out what's good and what isn't. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's great seeing games like Donkey Kong and Dig Dug; they were some of the first I ever remember playing.<br><br>However, one of the reasons I'm asking for Blitz games in particular is because I also wanted to look into the 2D vs. 2D-in-3D issue. Everything I've programmed so far is in 2D, but I'm considering scrapping everything and reprogramming it with 3D sprites. I'll have to search the boards for more about this, since I've never used this technique (and don't know it's advantages/disadvantages), but any advice would help.<br><br>IPete: I didn't know Platypus was so highly regarded. I stopped frequenting the site several years ago, but visit occasionally for news about BlitzMax and such. I'll have to load it up again.... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This is first time I've been back to the board in quite some time. Nice to know people still remember it. <br><br>I've been on an extended break from programming.

I'm no expert at the low level stuff but I'd assume this down to both the CPU cache and the way that once the graphics card has drawn one image, it seems to find it very easy to repeat the same image many times over. (I assume this is what Bouncer refer's to as single surface)<br><br>But it's definitley the graphics drivers (I know for a fact fellow Blitzer Quicksilva has also had this problem). I've tested it extensively in WinME and XP. After the 30.81 drivers it goes from 2000+ shapes to about 400. Now 400 is more than adequate to write a game, but it cuts out a lot of the special effects I had worked so hard on. Copyrects, which I used extensively also suffers badly under the new drivers. <br><br>It was all extremely disheartening and took me so long to identify the problem that I was sick of Blitz and programming in general.<br><br>But if anyone's written a system that pushes thousands of differetly textured sprites in 3D I'd definitely be keen to see it, just to know it can be done.<br><br>Anyway, I learned my lesson about writing games that push the hardware. I'll definitely be writing much simpler things in future.<br><br>P.S. Isn't the 9600XT an ATI card, I've found no problems with the ATI cards, they seem to be great for 2D and IBM runs a treat on them. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
