When users non-commercially redistribute the binaries they received from you, they must pass along a copy of this written offer. This means that people who did not get the binaries directly from you can still receive copies of the source code, along with the written offer. <br></div><br><br>I understand this to mean that I have to offer to disclose my source if I use something that is GPL'd in my program.  As I then become the third party referred to in that relevant section.<br><br><div class="quote">  Does the GPL allow me to sell copies of the program for money?<br><br>    Yes, the GPL allows everyone to do this. The right to sell copies is part of the definition of free software. Except in one special situation, there is no limit on what price you can charge. (The one exception is the required written offer to provide source code that must accompany binary-only release.)<br><br>Does the GPL allow me to charge a fee for downloading the program from my site?<br><br>    Yes. You can charge any fee you wish for distributing a copy of the program. If you distribute binaries by download, you must provide "equivalent access" to download the source--therefore, the fee to download source may not be greater than the fee to download the binary.<br><br>Does the GPL allow me to require that anyone who receives the software must pay me a fee and/or notify me?<br><br>    No. In fact, a requirement like that would make the program non-free. If people have to pay when they get a copy of a program, or if they have to notify anyone in particular, then the program is not free. See the definition of free software.<br><br>    The GPL is a free software license, and therefore it permits people to use and even redistribute the software without being required to pay anyone a fee for doing so. <br>If I distribute GPL'd software for a fee, am I required to also make it available to the public without a charge?<br><br>    No. However, if someone pays your fee and gets a copy, the GPL gives them the freedom to release it to the public, with or without a fee. For example, someone could pay your fee, and then put her copy on a web site for the general public. <br></div><br><br>Those Q&amp;A seem to me that if I write a program with your GPL'd gui, my work becomes a derivative of it and must be GPL'd itself, and subject to the above.  Which states that someone can buy my "for sale" work and simply turn around and put it up on download.com for download by anyone.<br><br>which seems to be verified by:<br><br><div class="quote"> If I use a piece of software that has been obtained under the GNU GPL, am I allowed to modify the original code into a new program, then distribute and sell that new program commercially?<br><br>    You are allowed to sell copies of the modified program commercially, but only under the terms of the GNU GPL. Thus, for instance, you must make the source code available to the users of the program as described in the GPL, and they must be allowed to redistribute and modify it as described in the GPL.<br><br>    These requirements are the condition for including the GPL-covered code you received in a program of your own.  <br></div><br><br>Maybe I'm reading it wrong?
