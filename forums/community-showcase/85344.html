Wow.<br><br>Spectacular crashing. :-?<br><br>First of all: Installer in Spanish/Portugese (?) no biggie, but you probably should have an English language installer available as well.<br><br>- When launching the game:main menu looks nice.<br>- Picked the 'quick race' option<br>- when the race track popped up, the camera was going completely crazy spinning around. Then all of a sudden the cars got launched extremely high straight into the air, and fell down again. the world kept spinning uncontrollably, other than the short time when the camera was looking at the cars launching themselves in the sky. (The cars jumped so high the camera almost couldn't see them anymore before they fell down again)<br>- I hit ESC to go back to the menu -- that worked, although there was no longer a car in the center of the circle (not sure if that was intentional or not)<br>- Tried to start another game. This time the camera stayed steady at first, but the cars were 'hobbling' and very unsteady bouncing around like they were driving on cobble stones. I was able to drive a carlength or two, when the screen started spinning around again instead of following the car, and the executable crashed (Windows vista 'application stopped responding' dialog box, with the 'wait' and 'close the program' options.)<br><br>Some info about my system:<br><br>- running windows Vista 64 , Servicepack 2<br>- Core 2 Duo 2.4GHz<br>- 6GB RAM<br>- Game was installed to z:\games instead of the default folder<br>- ATI Radeon 4670<br>- Only mouse/keyboard connected, no joystick or other controllers present<br><br>And a final thought: 'simple race' does sound like a somewhat underwhelming name for a game like this... Of course you're are free to pick whatever name you want, but I have a feeling that you're hurting yourself a bit when it comes to trying to sell it, since a lot of your customers may skip over it because of the 'simple' -- flashy eyecandy helps sales, and purposefully calling it 'simple' insinuates the opposite of that. In my opinion you're selling yourself short with it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Maybe your giving the physics engine too much time on faster computers???<br><br>----------------------<br>Possible improvements:<br>----------------------<br><br>Better textures for the road part of the track.

Lovely artwork and design there (expect the cursor)<br>The racing felt pretty good, so nice use of physics (i assume your using them)<br><br>The other cars seemed to race pretty well. Was too slow moving on this PC to really tell.<br><br>The track seemed to have quite a few, nice looking props (the trees looked a bit flimsy), but overall nice :)<br><br>-------------------------------<br>Things that i noticed the most:<br>-------------------------------<br><br>Definatly the Track textures low and stretched resolution, and the cursor.<br><br>Finally, good luck with this, it looks like a pretty decent racer and you look to have pushed blitz3d quite a bit with this :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The stands especially could do with a few people rather than being empty.<br><br>Major problem I found was the lack of a map showing the circuit, or even any signs around the circuit showing what turns are coming.

I like this a lot, and I think it has a LOT of potential. Just for starters, it's graphically beautiful.<br><br>That said, I think there are a lot of issues to be fixed before it's market-ready. Here are some of the ones I found by playing a race:<br><br>- MAJOR BUG: When I finished the race - in 6th place - the game crashed. Completely. The error message said "Userlib not found."<br><br>- The car steers like a tank. Literally. The steering is way too unresponsive, until the car hits something, at which point, "FWING," it spins as though it's on ice.<br><br>- The camera needs to be behind the player BEFORE the race starts, not after. My suggestion: after a brief "into" period of the camera turning around the player, center it behind the player &amp; use an onscreen "3...2...1... GO!" counter.<br><br>- The main menu's cursor needs to be more obvious, perhaps with an image of some kind. And never, NEVER let your game start with the cursor in the top-right corner. Just use <b>MoveMouse GraphicsWidth() / 2,GraphicsHeight() / 2</b> to solve that issue.<br><br>- This is probably more an issue with my computer, but you should still hear about it. These are my system specs:<br><br>2 P4's at 3GHz<br>1 GB DDR RAM<br>ATI Radeon X300 SE 128MB DDR, PCI-E<br><br>Generally, the game ran at 45 FPS or higher. However, every time there were any dust clouds onscreen, the framerate immediately dropped to 15 or less. A subtle effect like dust shouldn't cause such a major frame loss; you should look into it.<br><br><br>With all that said, I must reiterate that I love the concept of this game. Love it. Your menu is gorgeous, and so are the levels. I also think you were very clever in your use of textures; the way you "stretched" the texture on the road makes it feel like you're going much faster than you actually are. I really want to see this project finished! :D <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I really like it<br><br>May I comment and show a couple of bugs for you to fix, which wasn't mention before.<br><br>About joysticks and wheels. It works OK for a simple game pad, although using one thumb for steering and accelerate/break is a bit of a stretch, wheel didn't work by default because most wheels use "Z" and "R" axis for accelerate/break and don't have "Y" axis, unless player specially combine axis (Logitech wheels can do this). Anyway, it will be good to have some sort of joystick setup menu. And it is sad there is no FFB. :(<br><br>There is one very disturbing bug. If a player, instead of 'racing', just drive back a bit and when he/she clears pit stop entrance and then move forward, then "Ta-da!" player finish first lap. It seems to me that there is some sort of "check point" near pit stop entrance. I think, you need more than one check points, else you will have whole lot of cheaters.<br><br>I think rest of the easy-to-catch bugs with a camera, disappearing engines and wheels, particles causing fps drop you can easily fix and we will play a very good game.<br><br>Keep it up!<br><br>BTW anaglyph 3D is when you need to wear different color glasses to view what is on the screen. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

And doing this I ended up starting in lap -1, but it got reset to 0 after a short while.<br><br>- I drove into a barrier at very high speed, and I ended up below the track, and gravity just pulled me faster and faster down to infinity, my speed reached more than 2000 mph :-)<br><br>- When you press esc and pause the game, and then click no to resume the game the game timing seems to jump, it needs to be reset so that game doesn't think that time has elapsed this much.<br><br>That was just what I just found trying it out, keep up the good work :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
