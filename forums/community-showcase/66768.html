I've been busy for a while, creating an editor for my game. But since it's going to be pretty multi-purpose, i decided why not let everyone use it. So, this is just a test to see what you guys think so far. It's going to be a fairly straight forward, yet functional editor.<br><br><img src="http://www.rosscrooks.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/expscreen.jpg"><br><br>DOWNLOAD - www.rosscrooks.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/editor_exp.zip<br><br>CONTROLS:<br><br>HOLD LEFT control key + LEFT mouse button  =  Camera move X and Z axis<br>Hold LEFT control key + RIGHT mouse button = Camera move Y axis<br><br>You can load meshes via the load mesh icon at the top.<br><br>Click on mesh to select it<br>Holding LEFT SHIFT key whilst clicking to multiple select.<br>Clicking and dragging the AXIS gadget moves it. Again, left mouse button control X and Z axis. Right mouse button controls the Y axis.<br>You can choose a transform mode. Your best with GLOBAL. This dicates the way the entity moves. Not finished completely.<br>You can choose an editor mode. MOVE, ROTATE or SCALE<br><br>Once in these modes, again, the left mouse button controls X and Z axis's, and the right button controls the Y axis.<br><br>The purpose of the Axis Gadget: If you are rotating, for instance, multiple meshes, the gadget will centre itself between the meshes. But you can move it manually, by clicking and dragging it.<br><br>The gadget acts as the centre of rotation. Also acts as the centre of scaling.<br><br>I know them instructions are alot to read, but you need to know how to work it :o)<br><br>Please let me know how it handles. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Forcing the user to switch between move and rotate mode will produce a lot of clicks for no good reason IMHO. You may have to rethink your current GUI concept. In the same time you should prevent too much multi-key functions (eg. press shift-ctrl-mouse-coffemachine) because people tend to forget them soon.<br><br>3rd: Add a settings window that allows to set the entity properties: entityFX, entityAlpha, etc. I suggest to work systematicly, by parsing the command reference (online version is rather complete) and use everything in the entity section that may be set by the user. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'm basing my camera controls on other modellers, editors out there. I'm afraid i can't agree on the holding down control key and mouse buttons to move the camera, but i will look into that regardless :o)<br><br>I will also try and rethink the Mode switching, possibly with a keypress? 1 = move, 2 = rotate, 3 = scale ... etc?<br><br>Thanks for taking the time to have a look. Have you ran it yet btw? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I also had 2 mouse pointers on screen which didn't help  - there was a second mouse pointer that would float in the middle of the screen over the gizmo. If you're using a custom mouse pointer then you can hide the windows one.<br>I found trying to manipulate objects a little difficult. When you are moving objects they can sometimes be off screen because the camera seems to keep focus on the gizmo, which seems to stay centered, rather than the object The "Scale" tool also seemed to move the object rather than scaling.<br>It could be that I just havent spent enough time with the interface and I'm using the wrong camera mode so I'll give it another whirl later - keep up the good work. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

When you click an object, The gizmo centre's itself in the middle of that mesh. When you select two meshes, it centres between the multiple selections. You can move the gizmo, by clicking and dragging on it.<br><br>I forgot to put in hideMousePointer in that :S Working in full screen too much.<br><br>As with moving the meshes, i wanted to keep the mesh on screen, so you didn't need to move the camera, move the mesh... etc. I guess that does need some work though.<br><br>What happens is the selections are held within a type list. Upon moving/scaling/rotating, they are all temporarily parented to the gizmo, which moves everything, scales everything... etc. You can manually move the gizmo though.<br><br>Thanks for the feedback though. I appreciate it. Alot of the code is written, just not enabled, as i want to get the basic controls right before anything else. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I only wanted to give some useful ideas from somebody who created several levels and started to optimize the user interface in the millisecs range. It's a fact, chanching the modes for example to switch between camera motion and object motion is a nightmare.<br>In my editor I am using virtual gadgets, so you only have to click for example the X-Position button, drag the mouse on a thought scrollbar to alter the X-Position. So it's one click only. Of course there are more ways to achieve the same.<br><br>At the other hand, if you use a well known interface of a popular app, a lot of people will like it and my suggestions my be useless here. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
