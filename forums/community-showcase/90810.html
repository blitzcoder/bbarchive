If I can point out a couple of immediately obvious (to me) problems:<br><br>1. Some of the tiles - most notably the North and West ones, and the green dragon - are very pixelated compared to the others.<br><br>2. The tiles themselves are too square and sharp.  I'd like to see them with chipped, raggedy edges for a less sterile look.<br><br>3. Make the shadows more shallow and with softer edges.<br><br>4. I'd like to see more background images for variety.

But you know... you are actually the one who inspires me to push on and write code even when I don't feel like it. I read your blog and it always gets me anxious about completing my games. I actually would like to publish this game on Bigfish but I haven't heard anything from them yet. <br></div>Yeah Xmas Bonus was pretty primitive, but it's also 5 years old and the visual quality of casual games has moved on since then.  In order to compete on a portal you need a great looking game.  Glad you find my blog useful, thanks for letting me know.  It's great you've completed a game, hopefully the first of many.  You can put what you've learned in this one to good use in the next one.  Good luck. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
