It seems like we will be seeing a flight game project going gold after all.  However, it is called "DodgeFlight."  Why such a name as DodgeFlight?  Well, I was trying to come up with a concept that took elements of a dogfight, as well as elements of Dodgeball as well, and you were in flight with fighter jets, so it all came together with that clever name.  <br><br>It is actually a tournament-based flight battle that pits you in a F-22 Raptor vs. a Mig-29 Fulcrum in a one-on-one battle.  The goal is to avoid the enemy plane from crashing into you, or else he scores a point.  If you knock him down with a missile or a machine gun bullet, you score a point.  The first point to hit the frag limit of 20 wins, and the game is then over.  This takes place in the Middle East, and it seems to be worth the effort of coming up with that theme (trying to stick with current events, you know).  It should be gold, and on an FTP sometime around Valentine's Day or President's Day (somewhere in Mid-February in Lehman's terms).  Here is a quick screenie from the game itself.  Should be fun.  The way I programmed it, I was hoping to port it to a console eventually, but I don't think that's gonna happen, not with Blitz 3D (I wish they'd make it easier to port to a PSP or an XBox, or something).  Here's your screenshot:  <br><br><img src="http://forums.3drealms.com/ubbthreads/attachments/1033894-dodgeflight.jpg"><br><br>It'll be released when it's done, but that should be within the next couple of weeks at most.  It's one of the first flight games to be used as a tournament battle, but I sort of took that idea from Quake 3 Arena (give or take), as well as some flight games like Crimson Skies (I believe that's the flight game for XBox), and Captain Skyhawk (remember that from the NES from a long time ago?).  It should be a great game to release for those who like top-down flight combat games.  I won't disappoint this time, not like that project that I recently dumped. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Also, the ground below, I wanted to make it look a little desert-like, like you were really in the Middle East.  To me, designing a desert fighter seemed to be a little easier than a WWII fighter.  There's too many WWII games out there, I felt that having a flight game with a more current theme would probably change the trend of war gaming. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Are you asking me not to make this game go gold after a month's worth of effort?  Well, maybe I may go 3D on this one, give it that "XBox" look to it.  <br><br>Off topic:  I wonder if Crimson Skies is available for PC as well as XBox, that was an awesome game demo at EB Games that I played about a year ago. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Dude, I'm not trying to get down on your idea here, but your talking about this thing like it's the next Halo....going gold? Ports to Xbox? You have a top-down 2D shooter that was drawn in MS paint. Spend a couple years studying programming, color theory, marketing trends, and have a couple games that have been proven to be accepted by a wide audience in the gaming industry before you try to 'go gold' with stuff that looks like it was made pre-1982. Not trying to be an ass here, I just really think this thing may not go the way your expecting it to. Good luck either way though, the idea itself sounds cool. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

All in all, it does have that desert look.  Well, some of it was done in MS Paint, but the majority was snapshots from the Internet, and enhanced in PSP.  I sort of do some "tag team" graphics development with different programs coming together.  Pretty soon, I'll be looking into doing Maya with another version, and using this code format on 3D-style gameplay.  As I said, hope that some versions of Maya won't be that bad of price as it's made out to be.  I'm not about to spend $600 on that, as some budgets don't allow for those high price tags for a graphics enhancement program.  I don't even think Maya's really available to the general public, either, except for their demo programs, which are very limited in features as opposed to the "big game company" versions. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I notice that Wacom's a great tablet, no matter what they say.  Guess I'll be using this tablet for future versions.
