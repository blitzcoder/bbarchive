Took the upper route to the locked door. Back to flare, down passage some way and it locked up solid. Repeating sound no keyboard response.

It was the options screens where the slowdown occurs.<br><br>Played again right through the tutorial level, this time no glitches or problems of anysort during gameplay.<br>First person games are not my thing at all (I suffer from motion sickness with most of them), but this did look to be quite a fun puzzler, with some nice touches. One annoyance was the 'grunt' on jumping, especially on a flight of 'stairs'. Perhaps a few different grunts at random, with the occasional no grunt at all, or none to start with but bring them in after a number of consecutive jumps i.e. you are a bit tired...<br><br>Had a quick fling with the editor too, but had lots of problems there. Got a red cube (I think) rotating up from the bottom which would dissapear then start again. No buttons appeared to do anything, although I was taken out to the help screen when that button was clicked. The only problem was that exiting the help, and going back to the editor, only flashed the editor briefly before reloading the help pages again. This carried on ad infinitum and I had to end it with task manager. It was as though the last mouse click was repeating over and over.<br><br>Oh and I was a bit dissappointed when I found the decryption terminal or whatever. I was under the impression I would have to do something to decrypt something or have an extra code breaking puzzle to solve but it just did it itself :-( <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

We have tracked down a possible cause for the slowdown.  It's to do with 'too many' Sprite Candy effects running at the same time.  The next version will not have this problem!  Thanks for reporting it.<br><br>2.  We will action your idea of the grunt option.  It's a good idea.  Thanks.  It will be in the next version.<br><br>3.  The editor is not written for performance in mind - in fact it stinks, it's slow and very user unfriendly.  We wrote it so we could design the worlds and figured hey why not give it away with the game.  Perhaps we need to add a little note in the docs to warn about it.  Thanks.<br><br>4.  Regards the decryption terminal.  Just yesterday we have a brain storming session about it.  We are planning on sticking it all sorts of logic puzzles all over the place that you need to complete to progress.  The current idea for the terminal is this.  Dotted around the world there will be "1"s and "0"s.  You will have to find the correct number of "1"s and "0"s, plus the sequence to plug into the terminal to start the decryption sequence.  <br><br>If you have any other cunning thoughts please let us know.<br><br>Thanks for trying qoob.  v0.10 coming soon.<br><br>Follow our progress here - <a href="http://dev.boiledsweets.com/flyspray/index.php?tasks=all&amp;project=5" target="_blank">http://dev.boiledsweets.com/flyspray/index.php?tasks=all&amp;project=5</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
