I've just bought BlitzMAX a little over two weeks ago and dove into it right away. When I saw the sample code's "breakout" I couldn't resist making it a bit more playable. Just a few hours later I had the first draft for my very first game ever! (I mean, i did write a few little things on the c-16 and later c-64, besides a whole bunch of intros and demos on the Amiga, but all of that is like...eh... 20 years ago?)<br><br>I'd love to get some feedback, since I don't even know how a 2d breakout/arkanoid type game is received nowadays anyway, but I still love that stuff. I still can't believe I'm allowed to go crazy and try to put in everything I'd always wanted...or so...hehe. Makes me feel like a kid again.<br><br><a href="http://www.taron.de/Storage/blitzmax/taronoid/Taronoid.exe" target="_blank">TARONOID LATEST BETA</a> (i'll keep updating this one here!)<br><br>INSTRUCTIONS:<br>- left mousebutton = attract balls (magnet force)<br>- right mousebutton = slowdown balls (brake force)<br><br>Each force has only limited amount of energy. Replenish them by collecting falling energy resedue from destroyed bricks. Special containers have extra energy:<br>- magenta brick = magnet force energy (debris needs to be collected)<br>- cyan brick = brake force energy (debris needs to be collected)<br><br><br>Here are some screenshots...<br><img src="http://www.taron.de/Storage/blitzmax/taronoid/snapshots/taronoid_snp01.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.taron.de/Storage/blitzmax/taronoid/snapshots/taronoid_snp02.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.taron.de/Storage/blitzmax/taronoid/snapshots/taronoid_snp03.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.taron.de/Storage/blitzmax/taronoid/snapshots/taronoid_snp04.jpg"><br><br>A little bit about me:<br>I'm a developer on messiah:Studio, an animation and rendering tool. My focus is rendering/shading/particles and some animating tools. I've been mostly a visual effects artist for almost two decades, but started programming again about 7 years ago. That was all C, though, and I havn't touched any other language ever since. BlitzMax is really fun already, while I still know only very little. I'm hoping that this little showcase makes it at least a little bit interesting to help me out with one or two tips'n'tricks every now or then.<br><br>What the game still needs:<br>AUDIO! - i have not much of clue yet, within blitzMAX...just a tiny bit.<br><br>Highscore - creating/saving/loading (I wished I could embedd it into the mainfile, too, but that scares the living crap out of me!)<br><br>improved collisions - have some troubles with over 30 balls hitting a thin pipe, hehe. I'm using image collision and wrote a code that checks traces back the entry into the image, but somehow it doesn't always help.<br><br>level codes - I want to write password access to levels. I believe it'll need it<br><br>What I still want in the game:<br>Loads of features/tricks/surprises and potentially some moving opponents, hehe! <br><br><br>So, yeah, check it out, it's still early alpha, but I just want to know if it's any likable already or even at all.

I'm running a widescreen monitor and I don't want it to stretch in fullscreen. There are a lot of things I still need to learn! The big advantage, however, designing is very easy, haha! Small res...no efforts! ;)<br><br>Is there an easy way to make the viewport at....I'll look into it, I think I know how I could make it!<br><br>I really don't know much about anything in BM, yet. My brain's cooking from everything I've learned in the last 15 days, but I'm also addicted to the process! <br><br>Can't download your zip, though... :{<br><br>HAHA, I have only a tiny bit different level design solution, using a two dimensional array only for having level index first and then the whole level as one array after with a tiny header to tell how many rows the level has. I design in within REM section and then just truncate it manually to fit in a one dimensional array... not really that tedious, but a level designer would be neat. I might try writing one... (dear god).<br><br>so far it would look like that:<br><br>level[num]=[header,pieces....]<br><br>rem level 1<br>[header,<br>piece, piece, piece, piece, piece<br>piece, piece, piece, piece, piece<br>piece, piece, piece, piece, piece<br>piece, piece, piece, piece, piece]<br>endrem<br> <br>...or more realistically:<br> <br>level[1]=[10,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]<br>rem level 1<br>[10,<br>0,0,0,0,0,<br>0,1,1,1,0,<br>0,0,2,0,0,<br>0,0,1,0,0]<br>endrem<br><br>My code is a mild battlefield, that's for sure. I need to somehow defractment it a little at some point, hahaha! DOH! But it still kinda works... I mean, I'm not lost in it yet...completely.<br><br>OH, by the way, I've invented a little spring system in it as well, which will be of significance later! I'll try to find some very neat ways of making use of it in the game. Initially I just wanted some balls dangle down from the top as targets, but during testing I just connected it to the paddle. Now I'm thinking it could really make a bizarre feature for later in the game. I'll keep it a surprise! :o)<br>(It's still jittery, though, but the line drawing from spring to spring hides it a little, hehe) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If I could figure out a more efficient way to use rather the velocity of the balls for collision detection, I could avoid the trouble of fast balls skipping over them. I have already reduced the ballspeed, but I'm not sure if it's still fun, when it gets "too slow"...hmmm<br><br>Uh, libraries...hmmm...I could look into that. I'm always a little afraid that physics simulations are too slow by their nature. I'm trying to reduce the computations to exactly what I need, normally. That's why I'm often having to reinvent the wheel, so to say, haha. I have no real comparison for my springs over any other, since I have never looked at any in depth. That's partially just because I was too lazy to search any deeper... tisk. :}<br><br>I'm very happy you like the magnet and brake thing, too! I think it makes the game far more interactive, but it's an interesting challenge to keep it suspenseful with it, you know. I'm in the process of designing levels that would take more advantage of them. In order to master those levels, you'd have to load up on energy and economize the use then as well. I'm also thinking about putting in a self-destruct feature...or rather ball exploder. It might become yet another strategic tool to deal with certain levels. ...it's just all too damn much fun! <br><br>By the way, does anyone know a way how to zoom an entire buffer efficiently for possible window resizing?  ...just curious... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Not sure how well that'll do, but I'm too time-greedy for the rotation calculation somehow... normalize motion vector, get radience and transform to degree...narf.

In my code i put the remark:<br>'----son of a bitch collision crap------<br>I could, however, disable the collisions with level items, that's right! Thought about it already, but you brought it home! Thanks! ;) <br><br><br>#2 There are some odd things happening with the paddle (-rod-), particularely after having used brake all the way (balls coming to a stop and going again afterwards). I can't figure out why that makes them pass through the paddle sometimes. But I also havn't used the collision image method on the paddle, only on ball against level items. So, yeah, definitely needs fixing. For a while I thought I'd pretend that the paddle is merely an energy field that repells the balls, occasionally letting them pass... LOL!<br><br>#3 When I revisited the rountines for speed I eliminated a square root call, noticing that it could be redundant. I had it there to normalize only the X vector for the paddle to ball velocity transfer, to keep it easier to control. I think I might put it back in, because I can only confirm, it feels really tricky. Mouse is tough to control and the occasional fps slowdown hits don't make it any easier.<br><br>That was some fantastic feedback, Xip, I really enjoy and appreciate it very much! I have no idea where I am at with all of this, since it is truely my first adventure into game development. Pure joy and a great learning experience already!<br><br>PS: I can't wait to put the rope into action!!! I have plans! ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
