Maybe your unzipper messed up the files? (cfg files etc.) The first video is the one with the chrome pharao head (game intro movie). The second one is the<br>green one with the mission briefing (level intro  movie). The second video is a mpeg, encoded with the TMPG encoder beta1.2 (patched japanese version). AFAIK it should play ok on any puter since Win98. Strange, since the first Movie is an Mpeg too, but it was encoded with bbpeg.<br><br>Red - of course Halo has a point, but saying I am no artist is more scaring than anything. It's one of those BTW-phrases I ask my self if the scaring part was intention. as for Bush I have to say Yes, it IS a political statement. Probably it's also a game engine, but these days there is a need for political statements IMHO. If anybody really wants to use the engine, he surely can ignore this demo graphics. At the other hand I doubt that I will make a lot of money with it, no matter how much bush is inside. So it won't hurt if somebody decides not to buy a license because of this statement.<br>If Charly Chaplin thought he should remove political statements from "the great dictator", what would it be today.<br><br>ROOK - yes, the destructable objects can kill chars if they are close enough. You can try this in the room where the two mutant ants are, the pool hall. Go to the door in the right hand corner and wait until the ant passes the nitro box, then shot the box.<br>The destructable objects also support chain reactions, when you place a row of such objects with the editor and then shoot the first, the all go boom. That is a recursive function. I agree, it's really silly, all the nitro glycerin Boxes all over the place. However, that was only to demonstrate it. BTW the c4 timebombs can kill too, but it's hard to time them right. BTW c4 and nitro can kill yourself too, when you are standing too close to the explosion.<br>I didn't understand the second question, PUSH the barrel and blow something up without a bomb? are you referring to the c4 timebomb?<br><br>Yavin - I know, it's not very fast. No VIS, no BSP Trees etc. The performence of this engine cannot compare with things like the old scool FPS engines that were capable to run smoothly on a 80486 with 100MHz etc. It is thought for todays 3D Cards, also the cheap ones, Radeon 9200, Geforce 5200 and better. I'd say everything less than a Geforce 2 may be too slow. <br><br>It will definitively not be for free. Everyone is trying to sell something these days, I surely won't give it away for free. Call it selfish if you want. i released a lot of Tools and Code snippets for free, but this will will cost a little.<br><br>As I said before, I plan to sell per-game licenses. I am not sure about the price yet, but I think it will be around 50$<br><br>Maybe there are better engines even for free. Feel free to choose them, fine, no problem.<br>It's just the way that this engine can be used without to edit one line of code. However. BTW. the mouse may feel sluggish due to the mouse-smoothing. In the options you can deactivate this. <br><br>Bob - thanks a lot, good to see an artist likes it. :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Personally I have seen many rough crashes like this, not only with my game, but also with any directx app, including non-blitz stuff. I think directX is still a patchwork that was never completely debugged. Sometimes it crashes and wipes out my desktop settings, setting it back to 640 pixels... Also the crashes are not reproducable. Oftenly they happen only the first time something runs.

Second, going down slopes isn't quite smooth as it could be. I also want to point out that the auto-crouching for vents is annoying, most obvious when underwater and instead of going into the hole you have to head towards the wall above it.<br><br>The engine still needs a bit of polishing before I can say it's really done. You might want to call this another beta and keep improving it.
