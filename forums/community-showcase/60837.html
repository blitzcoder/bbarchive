Seems well put together good luck with this.  Nice art style too.<br><br>Some observations:<br><br>- I know it's a keyboard game, but it might be better if the mouse worked on the menu and if there was a menu button in game that could be clicked (as well as the Escape button)<br>- No windowed mode!<br>- When you make a match, there is an annoying delay before the next pieces fall down, why is this?<br>- Why didn't you anti-alias the edges of your graphics (characters/shapes/bonuses)?  This is one of the major advantages of BlitzMax in my opinion.<br>- How do I know how far the next level is?  I got to level 2, but I just seemed to happen after a certain time, there was no indication.<br><br>That's it for now. Anyway good one and I hope it does well for you. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

We should have made that clearer though. <br><br>Regarding the anti-aliasing...we had to cut out a lot of features to get the RAM consumption as low as possible. We'll try and fix that up in future revisions.<br><br>About the levels, it goes by point value. After you have a certain amount of points, the difficulty incements (i.e. the speed increases, you have to contend with more block pieces, etc.) I agree that a counter would have worked here as well.<br><br>Thanks again!<br><br>-Dmitry <br>Apricot Games Inc. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
