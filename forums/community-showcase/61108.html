We also won't be staying with rooms and corridors as tight as this for some of the game.  <br><br>Some of the features of the 'engine' behind this game that are not shown in this small demo are that it is possible to have sections of the pre rendered map animated - which includes animating the collision map &amp; the 'z maps' if desired so that we can have things like doors being opened/closed/destroyed, blinking lights.  Because all the units' image data is stored in system memory not video memory that leaves a lot more to play with in most cases for units and it means that the level images, which are stored in video memory, are left with a bit more space to work with.   Unlike most of my earlier games the pathfinding is not precalculated but is done in real time using 'steering' methods.  Although they work better in open environments with the right weightings they can work okay in environments like this. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
