The difference this time is that the game is a more complete all-in-one package, and it is far more competitive - for example, when you do reach the Premiership and win the title, there is something beyond that (Champions League/World Club), where as before there wasn't much else to do once you reached the top flight; the World cup is much tougher, too with qualification rounds.  I personally felt it was a giant leap forward rather than a small hop as far as the updates go, plus I added a couple of new wildcards.  Hopefully you will enjoy it more as you get into it :)<br><br>Thanks again for your feedback. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Took a bit of effort for you third time around, hey!<br><br>During my testing period I took Peterborough up to the Premiership in consecutive years, then acciedently erased the game save with another one for a different team - which prompted me to add a the request prompt before proceeding to overwrite an old game.<br><br>I haven't had much success in the FA Cup; I get the odd burst into Round Two, and on rare occasions I have reached the Quarters, but not very often do I progress beyond that - I certainly haven't reached the final ... yet - and I programmed the thing!!! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
