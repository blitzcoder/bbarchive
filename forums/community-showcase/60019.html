That really ended up being too much work while I try to concentrate on our main products, and that is the Arcade-In-A-Box.  However, the new www.iRetroGames.com is going to be all about content for home arcade enthusiasts.  We are looking for games that can work with the home arcade setup and will be posting them on the site with reviews.  Our readers can download the demo or purchase directly from our site if they wish.  So if you have an affiliate program you use (bmtmicro, regnow, etc) we will become a partner through that service and add the buy button.  If you would prefer us to just link directly to your sales page, that's fine too.  We are not here to make money off the hard work of developers.  The affiliate programs are just an easy way for us to add the demo and buy it now links.<br><br>With that said, hope you like the new site, and take note that we are looking for help with it.<br><br>And we encourage developers to continue to register at www.aiabgames.com.  It's just a way we can keep in touch with everyone that is registered with mailings and so forth.<br><br>So the dev backend/portal will be coming down shortly.  Simply because it no longer links to the database used for the site.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Ed Farias<br>Arcade-In-A-Box, LLC<br>----------------------------------------------------------<br>It was suggested I start up a new thread, so I'm going to summarize the old thread a bit first.<br><br>We are looking for developers to create arcade style games that will work with the home arcade setup.  This does not only mean the Arcade-In-A-Box system, but the thousands of home arcade cabinets out there.<br><br>If you are interested in developing for this type of market you can register at www.aiabgames.com.<br><br>These systems take some pretty specific keyboard inputs, here is a tech sheet giving some guidelines.<br><br>www.aiabgames.com/downloads/AiabTechSheet.pdf<br><br>www.iRetroGames.com released it's first press release today thanks to IndiePath and IndieGameBusiness.com.  I'll keep you all updated on the results from this.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Ed Farias, www.arcadeinabox.com <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I beat it to death so much, that I couldn't even concentrate, so now I'll just stick to what I knew beforehand in helping other developers behind the scenes, who knows?
