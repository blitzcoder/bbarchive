I believe that it's really good fun to play and customers seem to agree based on early sales figures.<br><br>It's entered the BFG top 100 at 21 and hasn't had any special promotion yet.  It should catapult into the top 10 over the weekend and then I'll see how high it goes.  Naturally I'd love it to be my first no.1 game but as we know the top of the top 10 is normally ruled by Hidden Object/Adventure games, although the occasional Time Management can hit the top spot if it really excels.  The best match-3 of recent times, Fishdom, got to no. 3.<br><br>You can read about how long it took and related stuff in this blog post: <a href="http://greyaliengames.com/blog/just-finished-programming-my-latest-game/" target="_blank">http://greyaliengames.com/blog/just-finished-programming-my-latest-game/</a><br><br>Why did we make a match-3 game?  Well John Cutter ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cutter" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cutter</a> ), a senior designer/producer at BFG and veteran game designer/programmer from the Amiga days, has made loads of great games for the BFG online community site: <a href="http://atlantis.bigfishgames.com/" target="_blank">http://atlantis.bigfishgames.com/</a> , and BFG thought it would be a good idea to convert the most popular ones to download versions.  So first I converted Fairway Solitaire (and added loads of extra stuff in with John + polished it) - it was a big hit.  So then they renewed my contract and we decided to convert Unwell Mel because a) it was popular b) it had a unique theme and would stand out c) I already had a match-3 engine that I could adapt and d) we thought it would be quick.  Well d) turned out to be false due to the complexity of some of the game elements (bug interaction, different game mods, powerups etc), meta game, and polishing - and also delays caused by myself if I'm honest.  Anyway, finally it's launched and I'm very proud of the end result.  I was involved in a lot of the design for this one which is why I'm credited as a designer too (check out the credits screen, it's neat :-))<br><br>A little polite request: if you don't like match-3s, please don't come here to troll.  At least try to see the good points in how the game is made and enjoy the fact that it's made in BlitzMax, which rocks (I 100% recommend it if you haven't bought it yet).<br><br><img src="http://www.greyaliengames.com/unwellmel/MelTitle.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.greyaliengames.com/unwellmel/BugZapper.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.greyaliengames.com/unwellmel/MegaPill.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.greyaliengames.com/unwellmel/Scanner.jpg"> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Given the gameplay's always pretty much the same, does the amount of 'polish' factor in, or do people buy games based on themes that interest them, like this medical one? It's an interesting question given that most programmers tend to only think of the actual gameplay as the important part in determining how good a game is, and I thought you'd know a thing or two having seen sales stats.<br><br><br>The BFG stub app won't install on 64-bit windows 7, so I can't try the game, sorry! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This game is an achievement for me in many ways though, in the details, the addictiveness, the quality, and the original elements.  Despite people saying that "match-3s" were dead a while back, I'm here to prove them wrong.  There's a huge number of people that still love them and will buy good quality ones.<br><br>@Warpy: The basic match-3 gameplay mechanic is the same, but many introduce different elements such as powerups (purchasable and on-board) and other game-board pieces that do different stuff.  They also have different Goals: some games make you just make a certain number of matches to win (I find those a bit boring), others make you remove tiles (see gunk in Unwell Mel), others make you match a target number of a certain shape (see bugs in Unwell Mel), or make you have to drop special shapes off the bottom, or clear a path for an explorer to walk along etc.  Plus there are the time management/match-3 combo games where you make matches quickly just to serve customers, they normally have a fairly basic match-3 component but it's tied to the restaurant or whatever meta game.<br><br>Some don't even use the traditional match-3 mechanic, they do sliding rows (like Chuzzle) or clicking bunches of matching shapes, or dragging the mouse over paths of matching shapes (like Magic Match).<br><br>Also many match-3 games have different mini games, some even have hidden object mini-games.  There are loads of different themes, often centring around ancient times, so Mel is different because it's medical and it's funny.  Also some have stronger stories and collecting trophies or building something meta games (Cradle of Rome for example) and those meta games really hook the player in.  Then of course you've got hugely varying polish levels from game to game and polish helps to sell for sure, but it must be added to an already solid theme and game with some original elements.<br><br>So in summary, despite there being tons of match-3s, they are not all the same at all - they share the same basic mechanic in the way that a sidescrolling shoot 'em up does, but vary in many other factors and this is enough to keep customers downloading them and buying them like they do with Time Management games, Hidden Object games, and indeed FPS and Racing and Sports games, and movies, and music - familiar (and fun) yet different.  Hope this makes sense.  I should blog that... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Are you able to duplicate that bug on a particular level as I can't?<br><br>@skn3[ac]: Yeah I know about the widescreen issue, it's the same for most games.  I asked them if they wanted proper support and they weren't too bothered (most customers don't care believe it or not, only developers do).  But I'll most likely add it to the next game anyway.<br><br>@therevills (again): It's an error that I spotted as soon as the page went live. I've asked them to change it.  The online version had an operation mini-game.  This one doesn't have any mini-games unless you count the collecting 10 coins micro-game and the use of the ice-cube to go into slide mode.  Yes I'm very proud of that zoom in and slo-mo effect.  You now know how to make the slo-mo effect with the framework and the zoom in was using the projection matrix - still it takes an expert eye to use it + apply sounds in the way I did ;-p [/blow own trumpet mode off].  Yep adding diagonal moves was hard (to avoid bugs).  Note that they only go diagonally if there is no possible vertical movement, I felt this was more realistic than most games where the items slide diagonally too much just in order to show off the effect.

Yeah I'd still love to make a platformer or shooter in my spare time (what spare time!?).  I'm making a template game system at the moment with the framework that I could use for such a project.<br><br>Btw, a lot of the polish in Unwell Mel is influenced by console games, for example the Mega Pill on level 7 basically does bullet time and the level end scores appear in a very arcade-like manner, and even the fireworks on the level end were influenced by Geometry Wars Evolved, oh and the way he ailments on Mel flash then fade came from me watching a super weapon build piece by piece in a shooter.  There's even a picking up coins challenge which is pretty hard to get all 10.  Check out the way the scanner slides out piece by piece and clunks and whirs + the way the hot spots appear  - very arcade style.  The fireball explosions feel really satisfying and some players have commented that the game feels like a fruit machine or something (that's because of the raising pitch of the match noises).<br><br>Basically it's all in the details which is why it took so long.  I used my retro heritage/knowledge to put in effects that I know work well and will look cool.  It's tempting to say "oh it's just a match 3, they are easy to make", and that's true for the basic mechanic, but then adding in new mechanics (like the 4 interacting bugs and 8 powerups) takes more time then polishing it all takes ages, then you have to add on multiple non-game screens which takes months to get right.  That's the reality of making a top level casual game, which people who've never finished one don't quite understand. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Yeah after Xmas Bonus I realised that programmer art was not the way forward (in order to make sales), so I hired a pixel artist for Easter Bonus who made some great art but then I realised that pixel art wouldn't cut it either when compared to the modern casual games at the time, which were using 3D rendered shapes and fantastic hand-painted backgrounds (or 3D rendered ones) etc.  So Oz and Holiday Bonus had much better graphics in order to compete, plus made use of BMax's 2D effects (scaling, rotation, alpha-blending).  Fairway and Unwell Mel both use cartoony art which is a different style again.  I get a feeling thought that 3D rendered and/or hand-painted quality stuff is the most popular style which sells most copies (Azada2, Ravenhearst 2 etc) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'm not much for casual games, but I know they garner huge market share, and I have enjoyed my share of them over the years.  Kudo's on your partnership/work with BFG.  I played the demo a bit, and I wanted to chime in with my opinion on the art.  I love it.  I spent at least half of my 15 years in the commercial game industry generating 3D assets, and the other half sketching, painting in photoshop, or pixeling.  They all have a place, and help set the the flavor of a game.  I don't know if it was your choice or a management decision/support guidance from BFG, but that kind of cartoony loose style of illustration is exactly what the doctor ordered for Unwell Mel.  The retro references to the 50's and 60's are awesome too.<br>Beautiful.<br><br>Bringing Joy to the world one pixel at a time...<br>   <a href="http://www.BenFischer.com" target="_blank">http://www.BenFischer.com</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Every time anyone said that over the last year or so I was sniggering but couldn't say anything.  There have been a few match-3s in the last year that have really been excellent and that got into the top 10 and made pretty good sales (they will never sell as many as a good HO game).  BFG wouldn't have entertained the idea if match-3s were really dead.  They are not dead although now they are a bit rarer due to everyone making HO games, so when a good one comes along match-3 fans love it, and there's a lot of them out there...Mine didn't even have any mini-games or many meta-games, but it still did well.  The key is just making sure the actual game rocks and is polished, then making sure any other screens you are also well made.  Oh plus I guess an unusual theme helps too. And Marketing.
