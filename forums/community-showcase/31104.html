There's been a number of good quality (better than Darkbasic that's for sure) smallish games, but no professional quality epics so far (at least not to my knowledge). I guess that's due to the time it takes to develop even a medium size game, the part time nature of most developers, and the many different hats a home developer (or is that 'bedroom coder'?) has to wear.<br><br>But I'm encouraged by the news that Blitz is getting exposure on magazine cover disks. Also, browsing the web, there seems to be a spreading indie scene, with new opportunities for selling games through the web opening up.  I recently downloaded Iron Tide, a 3d submarine action game from Trygames.com, 45mb download , full game, which after I’d tried I unlocked with my credit card ($25 US dollars) and it was all pretty painless. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

They get sick, hungry, angry, sad, etc. They walk, run, observe, hunt, eat, fight, talk, poo, sleep, create relations, enemies, etc. and basically have life's of their own - wich the player can interact with ofcourse. <br>From a design point of view the idea is that I ""simply"" define their character, and they do the 'playing' by themselves. The same counts for the player. The game itself has not one of those linear storylines, but basically creates a situation / world if you like. The player creates the stories and intrigues him/herself by interacting with that world...<br>The last year I've just been working on the 'emotional engines'.

I guess the issue with that kind of challenge is setting up complimentary rules that work well together and don't lead to odd and inexplicable results.<br><br>Before I started TU I was kicking around a somewhat similar idea for an adventure game; model a small community - personalities and day by day actions using emotions/needs- but I also had the hazy idea of overarching 'cycles within cycles'. Night and day cycles obviously, but more mysterious and subtle (occult/spiritual?)'cycles' that had odd effects on the townsfolk. <br><br>I thought it'd be great to have an adventure game that covered one night, in realtime, with the player racing to solve a disappearance before dawn, and the game played differently each time.<br><br><br>Any chance of a demo soon? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The 'time of day' is a perfect example. If you start on 'A', you need to do 'B' as well; but not before you've done 'G...X', etc.<br><br>So meanwhile, besides 20 include files just for emotions, I've had to create systems for (short term and long term) events, user interface, level editors, object editors, blah blah, etc. And before you know it it all clogs up and have to start over again. Currently my source is so extremely modular that it would suck the life out of a lego-brick ;) wich alows me to completely drop certain mechanism and re-do them. I'm keeping everything as simple as possible, but overall everything is so complex, that I can't even think about predicting what's gonna happen. <br><br>The cool thing about blitz is that actual '3d programming' is not so much of an issue anymore. <br><br>Besides npc's acting on impulses only, I'm also trying to implement 'daily routines' as you mentioned yourself. So that common people stick to common actions. I'd hate to see every farmer in town deciding go out adventuring, resulting in the city dying of starvation ;)<br><br>I'm doing my best for a demo, but I don't expect anything presentable for a few months :(<br><br>I'm eager to release a demo, not to show off, but as my (first) contribution back to the Blitz community. Obviously my routines are heavily inspired by other people's work and the help I got from the forums...<br>The only problem I see is that it would be so complex, only a few could make sense of it :)<br><br>we'll see...<br><br>cheers,<br><br>-Danny<br>p.s.

A profile gives it a set of 'emotions' and base scores to begin with (Some get more hungry quicker than others, some move faster than otehrs, etc). 'Emotions' is perhaps slightly misleading since it's a general term I use (lack of english) to indicate things as happyness/sadness, anger, fear, as well as hunger, energy, intimidation, confidence, etc. <br><br>Each 'emotion' is constantly shifting because of internal/external influences. Weights are applied to indicate the 'seriousness' of an emotion. Then all emotions are weighed to determine wich should be served (causing life-threatening situations to be dealt with first). Each possibility has a cost and a gain wich again are weighed to make a decision. The decision launches a 'task' to perform ('go bash his head in'), wich in turn consists of seveal actions ('move to table', 'pick up hammer', 'move to burglar', 'bash his head in'), etc. Swinging a hammer will cost him energy, but bashing someone's head in gives him satisfaction in return, that sort of thing. (hope this makes sense?! - not easy to explain 'quickly')..<br><br>I design these tasks and actions using a graphical editor (sort of flow-design) to make it simple and managable.<br><br>I'm about a month away to see if all this blah blah actually works.

I hope to create that pipe dream constantly found in rambling game design articles called emergent gameplay. Lifeforms will act based on rules that take into account their randomly generated statistics and "emotions". There is another part to this as well but I won't spread that idea until much later, if I havn't already. But you've got a huge head start already, which is a bit depressing. How much have you been working on this over the 6 years? Occasionally or has it been a big focus? I've been kicking around this idea in my head for a long time and only recently started some of the design document and concept art. I decided to use a pretty small area to make the whole thing as a feasible experiment. I have a pretty good vision of how the game should look and play like, but right now I'm still trying to comprehend how to code some of the systems.<br><br>The last few weeks I've been trying to think about how to code AI and AI networking much like what you have described. It really is a monster to comprehend isn't it? The balance testing I'm sure will be extensive. <br><br>Good luck on getting it work. I'm sure what I'm thinking of is quite different; I'm still going to attempt it. I'll be interested to see your demo when you release it! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I've been paying with the 'concept' in my head for years, doing all kinds of research and experiments here and there. Only the last year or two I can say I've actually been spending serious time on something that could really work.<br><br>The overal thing could be quite overwhelming when you first look at it. Let alone trying to explain it in a 'forum post'. That's one of the reasons why it's broken down in so 'bite sized chunks' - each of wich are actually pretty simple and very straight forward. Once the mechanism is in place, everybody should be able to create or add 'their own intelligence' to it - relatively simple.<br><br>I've also spend most of my time to prevent exactly that 'balance testing' you mention - Because I realise this is a cliche pitfall and could be an absolute show-stopper. But again, so far I'm still full of air, and still need to proof that all this bla bla will work :)<br><br>Game wise, I'm actually more of a techy. I'd love to be able to design my own characters, etc. But unfortunately I lack some serious skills in that area ;) <br>That's one of the reasons I'm developing something so 'generic' wich can be used for any type of game. In normal-life it would make more sense to code exactly what you need for the game you designed - saving you tons of time / money to develop ;)<br><br>I do feel the need to caution you though when starting on (what we call) 'game AI'. Quake style bots, etc. shouldn't be much of a problem - it's been done a 100 times. But something as over-ambitious as what I'm trying to explain will cost you an arm and a leg!<br><br>"emergent gameplay" is exactly what this is all about. (altough I must admit I had to look up the term to know what it was ;) I'd be interested what you mean with 'the other part' you mentioned.
