You've got runtime errors in your functions, may I suggest that these are not ideal as it will bomb a game out if someone gets their AI script wrong.

You can check it out above.<br><br>I've updated the code files above.  I will probably try to update the .zip file within the next few days so that you all can check out how it works/looks in the game.<br><br>I've had some thoughts on few more things over the past few days.  After adding the DrawText code, I've realized that we should put a limit on the number of bots that can compete in a competition.  Partly due to the lack of space on screen for displaying bot data, but also just for performance reasons.  Eight bots for now seems to be a good place to start.<br><br>Also, we need to come up with a way for each bot to start.  For instance, if only two bots start, we could have them start on opposite sides of the arena, no problem.  If four bots start, they could start on (equally spaced) 4 sides of the arena.  However, what should we do if three bots start or five bots?  We could equally space them, say in a circle, but that wouldn't necessarily start each one out in an <i>equal and fair</i> place once you consider that the arena is square, and that most arenas will have obstacles in them.<br>So, what are your thoughts on this?  Do we create a seperate arena for each number of starting bots (each arena giving each bot an equally advantaged starting position)?  Do we create our arenas to allow any combination of, say, two to eight starting bots?<br><br>Let me hear your thoughts... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Why not just make all positions same like for 8 bots and if theres 2 use only 1 and 2 it doesnt matter that they are not facing eachother or are not symetrical. I think the Arena.dat and arena.bb are needlessly complex and might also make for creating arenas pretty tedious if you are trying to make any walls because you might make walls over starting positions. I think they should be predefined, quite simply as stated, so each new bot is created one 8th clockwise from the number 1 bot. Possibly also using random numbers to place bots. <br><br>Now i see someone already suggested it, and i totally agree of course.<br><br>I don't see what ArenaUpdate() could be used for, unless you want to have dynamic arenas which i think is impractical. The arena should be static in all 3 states, and therefore i think we may as well loose that function. <br><br>So the new ArenaStart() should just read the clock, and winning condition from the file, but even that seems unneeded because you mentioned before that each arena will be a different goal so why not have that static and coded?

Every bot gets an equal chance to execute it's AI, irrelevant of the actual time that it takes the computer to process it.<br>We DONT NEED MilliSecs().  The clock is based on a sort of turn-based gameplay.  This isn't a real-time program.  Basing our clock function on real time would mess it up.  Not every computer executes code, or renders the screen at the same speed.<br><br><div class="quote"> Looking at the DrawText function, would I just have to replace <br> <br></div>You can use the DrawText command like so:<pre class=code>	thisText.TypeText = DrawText("P r e s e n t i n g   t h e   c o m p e t i t o r s . . .", 0, 0)
	thisText\TextID = StandardText</pre>The reason the return value is saved in a TypeText variable is so that we can assign it an ID, like you see in the example above.  The reason for the ID, is so that if we run through the TypeText Type list using a For Each loop, we can identify which texts are solo (StandardText), or part of the bots banner (BotBanner) or stats display(BotStat).  This way, if we, say, wanted to erase all texts on the screen, we could do so without upsetting any of the texts that are associated with the bots.<br>EDIT:You know, looking back on this, I should have just set StandardText to 0.  That would eliminate the step of having to assign the ID to at least the standard texts.  I may make that change...<br>Also, if we wanted to Show/Hide the text, or change it's ID, or just delete it entirely, we can do so through that variable.<br><br>Unlike the normal Text command though, these texts stay visible on the screen even after screen refresh (since they are 3D objects), so you don't have to keep 'redrawing' them to the sceen every game loop.  Your code (or SOME code somewhere) will have to delete them when they are no longer needed.<br><br><div class="quote"> the coding conventions...I personally think they can cripple the flow of the project if adhered to strictly  <br></div><br><div class="quote"> having the convention will help make writing the documentation easier <br></div>They do more than just help write the documentation...<br><br>They also help people to understand the code that's already been written since all the code in every file is written in the same style.<br><br>For instance, in the coding convention, it states that all Constants, Globals, Arrays, Types, Functions, and Labels (basically everything that's globally accessible) is Capitalized.  All local variables start with a lowercase character.<br><br>This one convention alone, helps people to quickly see which identifiers used in the code are Global or Local (which quickly tells them where they can find those identifiers elsewhere, meaning either within the same function or outside of the function).<br><br><div class="quote"> I'll correct any inconsistencies later on. <br></div>Trust me, that will never happen...<br>Do it from the start, so it's done.<br><br><br>BTW, you aren't really serious about a few of those sounds are you?

With obstacles you can get hiding behaviour, and wall guarding.  It also minimizes SnS victories (Sit 'n spinners) which just spin in circles, stop when they see an enemy and shoot.<br><br>The goal of the game, imho, should be to promote complex strategy, rather than tricks around the engine as has occured in other robot games (there's this one where if you use a certain movement command you can rotate while still moving, setting you up for the next movement - basically very agile bots).  The right screenshot looks very similar to that game actually, although 3d rather than 2d.  Some very simple physics could also be implemented for hover wars.<br><br>Output stuff will depend on methods.  You could have a modular weapon system (I suggest this for stratagy variation), or a universal weapon (most do this).  Same for sensors, but there is even more variation on top of this.  You could have queries to teh sensors that immediatly returns results.  This is probably most natural to a programmer, but in order to make it more realistic, and make scans more sparse, the sensor should be oriented or range set and on the next frame or even longer recieve results.  Either a callback or a query.<br><br>Modular Weapons example:<br>Rocker=CreateRocketLauncher(0,0) ;creation - slot 0, oriented forward<br>Fire(Rocker)<br>Mgun=CreateMachineGun(2,1) ;creation - slot 2, oriented right<br>Fire(Mgun)<br><br>Modular Sensors Example:<br>Sonar=CreateSonar(1,0) ;creation - slot 1, forward<br>Ping(Sonar)<br>Print Query(Sonar) ;Returns the distance from last frame<br><br>Creation commands can only be used in the beginning.<br><br>Oh, and here's how I prefer my driving:<br><br>LeftMotor(blah)<br>RightMotor(blah) ;blah=-100 to 100<br><br>Quick, concise and to the point.
