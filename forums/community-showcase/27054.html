(remember I am extremely picky about games)<br><br>Its a fun game, the gameplay graphics style is cool, and give the game a friendly family fealin. <br><br>I found that your controls were frustratingly bad. Especialy with the mouse, it was almost impossible to tell what direction the jets were aiming, and in times when this was essential for gameplay, it was dampening the fun.<br><br>I found the mouse the best out of the three control options, but even still your Rotate on Y axis with the mouse was very "jerky" and could have done with a smooth transition.<br><br>My other criticism is the gui, it seems lacking and as if "slapped together" compared to the to the rest of the game. At the end of my first round, I was bashing the keys wondering why it wouldn't advance screen, then I noticed I was meant to enter my name. This seemed a bit "frustrating", especialy having to do it absolutly every round.<br><br>Some more good things; The sound was very nice, gave a relaxed feel to the game, perhaps there could have been some more rewarding "STAGE COMPLETE" sound effects, but this was not really noticable.<br><br>Over-all, this game is fun, but personally I would have got some more people to beta it before you started the release process.<br><br>Anyway, good luck and I hope my notes are not too 'bad', but I was only giving my oppinions of the game.<br><br>Good luck :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Perhaps initially we should set up the best times to not be always beaten.<br><br>As for the control I also prefer the mouse due to it's responsiveness.  However, the other control schemes are basically molded right from Pilotwings (how the jets pitch when you press on the d-pad and automatically return to normal when you let off).  I felt that was a good game and control scheme and didn't want to ditch it.  <br><br>From my fairly decent beta test, I found there are some people who can play this sort of game and some who cannot come to grips with it's gameplay style.  I offered 3 different inputs to try and run the gamut, but the concept of controlling one's momentum in the air is what eludes the people who have a hard time.<br><br>Anyway, this sort of thing is good.  Before we launch to a larger audience I wanted the feedback of the community. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I ended up all over the place.<br><br>The presentation of the game is lacking somewhat I feel. Considering the rest of the game looks so good, it's a shame a similar effort hasn't been put into the frontend. To improve it, I would ditch the Comic Sans font for starters, and make the instructions font bigger - it is virtually unreadable in 640x480.<br><br>But with that out the way, I have to say the game is brilliant fun.

We are going to be making the GUI more user friendly as that's been the biggest complaint.  The other big thing is that the controls can be mapped to the same buttons for mouse (you need some buttons on the keyboard, since mouse can't support all controls) and keyboard.  So people will experience for instance a problem if they only switch the camera button on the keys, and assign another control to the down arrow, but don't do the same for the mouse.  Thus pushing the down arrow will do two actions.  I'm going to come up with a good solution for that though.  Just wanted people to be alert to that.<br><br>Another problem that's been reported is problems actually mapping controls like if you press the cursor apparently Left shift comes up under the customize keys menu?  This has only been experienced by one user so far and neither my partner not I can't replicate this.<br><br>Anyway, thank you community once again.  We're going to be shareware professionals and improve this product with free updates until it's loved. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Controlling the guy is tougher than it really should be.  I seem to have to let off the thruster before I can change the pitch of the jets sometimes ... this is pretty annoying.  I'd like to be able to make quick adjustments to the jets as I fly, ala Lunar Lander, but it doesn't seem to work that way.  Pity.<br><br>It's a neat game though.

The mouse is actually a pretty complicated beast for this sort of thing because everyone thinks a little different.

Um, pretty much the game would be unplayable with a digital pad if you had to manually set the thrusters all the time.  With the mouse you can do it because it can be fast or slow, but with a D-Pad it has to be one value and it would be horrendous to have to swing them constantly back forth manually.  If you want that kind of control the mouse works fast though.  I mean with this game you either boost up, let off, boost back, or boost forward, with short controlled bursts. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Nothing wrong with that I guess.<br><br>Never played pilotwings so I dunno about that. I'm pretty good with controlling inertia, generally, but this game did annoy me I'm afraid. I guess I'm playing it "wrong"... usually with this sort of thing, I like to set the thruster down and slightly back, so I can use controlled bursts to maintain height and move forward too. But with aerial antics, I always end up just shooting straight up in the air on account of the, what is it, "stabilising"? Maybe more practice and it will seem natural.
