When I saw BlitMax the first time a couple of months ago, I thought that that might be a good way to get back into the saddle, and I was not disappointed, what a pleasure to program in. <br><br>At any rate, back to the game.<br><br>Years and years ago, I played this game where you're supposed to direct a laser beam into a target by way of mirrors and prisms. I liked that game, and since I can't remember seeing or hearing of a current game by that principle (at least not beyond some simple java or flash versions here and there), I decided to make something like that.<br><br>It was for the longest time mostly a learning experience, and I used stuff like Timeline FX, Nitrous GUI and the Ignition framework extensively to help me get it done, but I never quite felt like it was my own thing. <br><br>But by this version, I have removed all these "crutches" and programmed my own frameworks, particle systems and menu systems. Now I feel more comfortable actually showing my face with it here. ;)<br><br>Of course, the particle system isn't as pretty as timeline fx, but maybe it will get there eventually.<br><br>I've done everything on this project, up from the code, over music to sound and graphics. I like being a jack of all trades, really, and in that this project was mighty fun working on.<br><br>It's not quite done, yet, of course, it's still only a demo... But most of the programming is done, I just need to add much more levels and a few more gameplay elements to make it more interesting. (Switches, doors, destructibles, moving elements, etc.)<br><br>It has a small story going on too, which I thought would be a nice gimmick.<br><br>Long story short, I hope you guys like it so far. :)<br><br><img src="http://www.kittomer.com/temp/lw15screen0.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.kittomer.com/temp/lw15screen1.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.kittomer.com/temp/lw15screen2.jpg"><br><a href="http://www.kittomer.com/temp/lw15screen3.jpg" target="_blank">Screenshot 4</a><br><a href="http://www.kittomer.com/temp/lw15screen4.jpg" target="_blank">Screenshot 5</a><br><a href="http://www.kittomer.com/temp/lw15screen5.jpg" target="_blank">Screenshot 6</a><br><a href="http://www.kittomer.com/temp/lw15screen6.jpg" target="_blank">Screenshot 7</a><br><br><b><u>Download:</b></u><br><a href="http://www.kittomer.com/temp/lazerworld0.15.0.zip" target="_blank">http://www.kittomer.com/temp/lazerworld0.15.0.zip (16 MB)</a><br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2011</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I played all levels. The particle system works fine. The arrow keys were to sensitive. They would move the screen way too quick when pressed. Same thing with the mouse movement. The prism selector also gets in the way some time and the only way to make it go away is to scroll the screen to move the area of interest away from the hotspot of the prism selector. Finally, the intro may be long for some but it was fine for me since the story was interesting.<br><br>Anyway, good job thus far and hope you add the other levels.<br><br>P.S.  I would suggest looking into using the right click to pop up a menu with the prism selector along with a delete option. Then on clicking an item the pop-up would disappear. I know, easier said than done :-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Other than that, it's really a pretty game. The sounds are a bit exhausting, I'd say. The hard kick on the buttons is too harsh and it takes a moment before one associates that sound with hovering over a button to begin with?! <br>The lazer sound is truly unnerving, I think and could be made a bit more pleasant, diffused and with probably more of a volume fluctuation/lfo to reduce the stress factor.<br>Visually I think it's very pretty, really. Gameplay, if the menu changes and the sounds are more pleasant it will be great.<br>Good job over all! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Dou you have a powerful bass speaker on your system?<br><br>On every system I tried the game on the menu button sound was very subtle.
