So I'm not going to look at them for too long. :)<br><br>For my money, you've found the best balance with number three. My second choice would be number five. Anyway, here are a few thoughts (picture by picture). Hope they don't sound too negative - I think its good work all in all.<br><br>1. The combination of yellowish background and red text may be too cheerful. The long vertical stains in the background texture are slightly over-prominent for my taste.<br><br>2. The background texture is a bit too subtle for the bold text. <br><br>3. Good balance. <br><br>4. I think the contrast and saturation of the background are too high in this one. The background is too 'distinct' if you like. Because of this, reading the text is kind of uncomfortable. <br><br>5. Distinctive. A good choice if a bleaker, grittier feel seems appropriate. <br><br>Sorry to cast doubt upon the one element you seem sure about, but I think there's a slight danger of the text looking more like comical jelly-writing than blood. Its easy to get carried away with those layer styles :) The font is spot on though. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
