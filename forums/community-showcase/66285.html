I figured it would be best to set the V-synch in the demo to true so everybody is pretty much seeing the same thing.<br><br>Oh also - you can set your own controls from the menu..it was quick bodge I smashed but it should work fine. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So e.g.:<br>- the tomatoes could leave their juice on the ground when they have been shoot dead. <br>- When you collect stars, they should leave some sort of stardust trail. <br><br>Also a mini map of the level would be nice.

Also maybe the first ones you see should only take one shot to destory as they are too hard initially until you get used to them.

I don't want to give the layout away unless it is actually explored.<br><br>I will make the tomatoes easier..I actually upped their agressiveness as they were too easy for me...goes to show why you need fresh feedback!<br><br>I'm pretty happy so far their are no major crashes or such - the code has been optimized and rewritten almost everywhere from my original code.

Don't know if that's intentional.<br><br>Obviously there will be more monsters in the levels.  I found the tomatoes a bit tough as they were quite aggressive (leaping at me, requiring multiple bullets to kill) and that I had to crouch to hit them before I'd yet got used to the gun. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I think the slow falling may just be Blitz sliding collisions conflicting with the movement translations of Tommy which is normal. I'll have a play and see if it's worth eliminating - thanks for trying it for me.<br><br>Was your download size the 11 meg or 7 meg? The latest upload is 7 meg and has the code tweaked a little.

It would also be nice to see more parallax layers.<br><br>The problem I had though (and maybe this is just me, and maybe this is impossible to do anything about) was that the scrolling left to right made the background appear blurry, and after not long my eyes began to hurt. Not too much longer and I think I would have felt a bit sick. I couldn't say exactly why that could be happening... The BACK-background, which moves slower, did not suffer from this. I don't kow if it's simply how fast it's moving, or something to do with how it's rendered. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
