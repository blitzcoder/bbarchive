Related to this, the situation where he hits his head against the bottom of a moving platform looks glitchy. Perhaps upwards collision could be disabled in that case, as happens in many platformers?<br><br>Turning in mid-air is a little too twitchy for my liking -- it was hard to precisely hit hovering objects or land on another platform, even a still one. (And related to that, there are a few small platforms that disappear off the bottom of the screen while you're jumping towards them, so it's hard to tell where to stop; coupled with the twitchy turning in mid-air, those cases were a little annoying.)<br><br>I found myself quite often having to walk/climb a long way just to get back to where I was, just because I missed a single platform, which could be a tad boring. Not sure what the solution is for that though.<br><br>The installer put a link on my desktop but it couldn't actually find the executable when clicked! I'd installed to my preferred location ("F:\TT Demo") rather than the default.<br><br>Anyway, it looks great and the bonus toys and other items are childishly exciting to get!

Some issue of the grass surfaces not rendering properly. Depending on the player's Y position more or less of the gass shows and sometimes none of it shows. Also when I pressed escape I got a very closely zoomed in red image and couldn't see anything else to click on. Had to force it to quit. But otherwise it looks to be a pretty cool game. Wasn't too fond of the jump handling though. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
