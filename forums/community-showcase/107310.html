I prefer being able to move everything to wherever I want it to be (arrange my "desk"). Also a programme needs to follow conventions (ctrl+c, ctrl+v, ctrl+tab for next document/child-window). Also of importance is "Clipboard", I should be able to copy something as "BMP" (or whatever they use there) so I could copy paste to another programme if needed.<br>What I wonder more is: you (Adam) surely wrote this for yourself, but I can imagine that you are very well known to Photoshop or another "powerful" painting programme. Enabling a grid there and you should be able to do there whatever you are doing here (dunno about "animation" as I use the old CS1 and never used it for GIF and Co).<br><br>The big advantage compared to PS etc. is the concentration on pixel painting (the "Tri-menu", the limitation of brush-sizes regarding the small "sprite sizes").<br><br><br>PS: I did not check your software now - but add keyboard-shortcuts for the most tools:<br>1-2-3-4 for brush sizes<br>x - to switch between the current and last color (like PS does)<br>e - switch on "eraser"<br>ctrl+s to save etc.<br>cursor up down left right for the "arrow-icons"<br>+ to zoom in<br>- to zoom out<br><br>Convenience:<br>C (hold) + "+" to increase brightness of the current color<br>C (hold) + "-" to decrease brightness of the current color<br><br><br>For the last shortcuts you might introduce a new pop-over if desired: hold down the mouse over the current color-"widget" (no click, but "mouse down") and on release show the popup. It includes the color in the center of a gradient. Alternatively "C (hold) + '+'" opens the Tri-Menu and moves up one step.<br><br><br>Think at least "x" and "e" would be really useful.<br><br><br><br>If you already added such shortcuts, just ignore the suggestions ;-)<br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Once you saved it with a file name, "save" will just re-save. "Save as" will always ask for a name. If working space is rare, put them both in a "drop down menu" - holding the button is then opening the menue, a short click just executes the "last selected" of this drop down. Maybe "save as" is your "two disks"-icon, in that case I interpreted that icon as "save copy" (mysprite_copy1.dat, mysprite_copy2.dat, ...).<br>Btw. saving that "copy" is something I liked from Blender: If you save your file and there exists already "that file" but with a previous state, then the older file is renamed to "myfile.blend1". The depth of this "backups" is adjustable via config.<br>This saves some headaches if you by-accident overwrote a previous state with a now borked one.<br>Dunno how much interest there is for doing this kind of "backup" even for "other files" with the same name (not just "previous revisions" of a file).<br><br><br>Add the possiblity to animate these sprites (do this in a different "workspace" of the editor - so maybe mix your other "programmes" together to achieve that)<br><br><br>Alpha: you have certain presets, maybe add a small sized "slider" below or on top to fine-grain the used alpha. Or - another idea - use a slider and on fixed portions (0, 25, 50, 75, 100) you add little buttons below for "fast selection".<br><br><br>Preview: you seem to have fixed amount of "upscaled previous" - maybe limit it to "up to two" and give each a "zoom"-slider / dropdown. So you gain additonal space for other information / tool options ...<br><br><br>Ahh... and while brainstorming with myself:<br>What I like from Blender is the handling of numeric input. While eg. rotating you could always enter "90" (even accepting backspace for edits) and it rotates by 90° instead of what you have done with the mouse. Then moving the mouse overrides that 90 again.<br><br>So how to use in your programme? Think again of the shapes:<br>- you clicked for the center of the circle<br>- - pressing "left" should now move the center to the left (similar for up right down)<br>- - your next click would set the radius<br>- - - so next to the cursor keys you also accept numeric input (+- 0-9) to set the radius by hand<br><br>For rectangle and ovals of course multiple steps are needed.<br><br>This allows for "mathematically exact" designs without having to count the pixels. I know for "10x10" this is not that hard, but imagine you are doing a "multi-sprite"-sprite (consisting of 4x5 sprites).<br><br>When writing about multi-sprites I thought of the shapes being able to get started outside of a sprite - this needs:<br>- a label on the screen showing the current coordinates (eg. "-100, -20") <br>- the option to move the "click point" with the cursor keys for fine positioning (when zoomed too far out, it is hard to hit the right spot)<br>- alternatively a "slider" to move the workspace by keeping current zoom factor<br><br>What's the benefit? Imagine you want an "arc" to get drawn, you often need to have a radius bigger than the sprite - so you need to start "outside".<br><br><br>Sorry if things start to get overly complicated with that ideas - no need to fulfill them (I do my pixel works with CS1 - and am used to it)<br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I am not sure if this is an issue with small power of two images, probably not TBH.<br> <br>My solution (and I do this as a matter of course now) has been to duplicate the edge pixels out and also add a 1px transparent border, I just run my sprite sheets through a tool I made to do this after I export from pyxle, this does mean I also have my own image loading and rendering functions but I needed these anyway as I use atlas' built in Texture packer. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
