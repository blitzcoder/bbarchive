Since I'm the only one that's making it, so far, this will take me forever. This is my current progress:<br>- Mainmenu scene, and menu imagegraphics finished<br>- Light nodesystem is finished (the editor, and the game can read the nodes)<br>- Small part of the city is completed<br>- Half of one car is designed<br><br>So, anyone wanna join?

People won't help you make a game if you're going to sell it and not pay them.  After all, that *is* what you said you were going to do, and I quote; "This game, when finished, is going to be sold, and the ones that helps me making it, will get a free copy of it, and beta versions during development."<br><br>2. You aren't going to make Grand Theft Auto 3 in Blitz as a first project, regardless of how many other 'lesser' languages you've used.  (I don't consider any language that doesn't use custom datatypes worthy of further investigation).<br><br>I don't mean to be disrespectful, as you put it, but, you said that you can't see a use for types.  That short-sightedness in my personal opinion, is due to the fact that you do not know *how* to use them, harking back to point 2 - lack of Blitz experience.<br><br><div class="quote"> Btw, if we were supposed to share the money, then how would be send the money halfway around the world? <br></div>Well, let's see.

No-one, so far, has made a comparible game in blitz.<br><br>And you are not going to attract collaboration when you havent released any software to show us what you can do, when you are unable to use basic features of the language, and when you aren't will to pay people (or even give them a share of the profits when you are done).<br><br>I would suggest you are much better off working on a small project, maybe a puzzle game or shooter or something, to gain skill with the language and show others what you can do, and then move on to big projects. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I take back the title "Anyone wanna join...". I realized that no-one would join project that will be selled. I agree that also experienced programmers can have problems with scripting. It's kinda like any other thing. You can learn what you need to figure it out, but it is always something new to solve. Like when I created my TH3 script compiler, I met lots of problems, even when I know most Pascal, but I finally got them solved, and got the compiler released.<br><br>Robleong, cool, you know stuff about car physics? I'm working on the Air Resistance part now. My (well, not mine) formula is: <br><br>AirResistance=(1/2)(AirDensity)(Velocity)^2(FrontalArea)(VehicleAirDrag)<br><br>Kinda not sure, but with it, and the formula for recalculating it to horsepowers, I got it saying: You need 58 hp to overcome the air resistance when driving in 100 km/h, which is 27.7778 m/s.

I didn't use a single Type in my Game Engine - and it's still one of the most complete FPS Game Engines done in Blitz.

Dont post on the forums asking for help unless you have actually made a good start on your project, If you havent done that already then your not really asking for help , your asking for some one to come show you or do it for you.<br><br>4. You must realise one small but important fact. 90% or a large amount of this community have either.<br>:: Completed a game fully ::<br>:: Got a Game published (and selling) ::<br>:: Started their own Mirco Dev Teams ::<br>:: Had a game in a respected MAG or paper ::<br><br>I think what im trying to tell you is that most of the people you will talk to have been doing this for a while and have actually got their foot in the door of the Games Market.<br><br>Even for those that havent they still have a vast amount of skill and information, so please treat us with some respect.<br><br>Like I should have done with you in the first place, so like Iv already said.
