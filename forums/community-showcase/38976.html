There's also a freeplay mode for playing individual levels, where you can try and beat your best score for that level and also save replays and share them with others.<br><br>Super Hamster Ball also comes complete with it's own level editor, so you can create your own level paks and then play them from within the game itself.<br><br>A couple of screenshots:<br><br><img src="http://www.supergerball.com/img/sgb_ss10.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.supergerball.com/img/sgb_ss15.jpg"><br><br>More screenshots can be found <a href="http://www.supergerball.com/screenshots/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>Download the demo from <a href="http://www.supergerball.com/download/" target="_blank">here</a>. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Wonderful feel &amp; execution.<br><br>I will not go on suffice to say I'm really quite impressed. I will point out everything thats wrong about it though as this IMHO is the only way I can help:<br><br>1. the tutorial should be one button and three missions, then done. Don't make them go back to it.<br><br>2. [edited]: the menu doesn't make it clear that different difficulties mean different levels. I first tried medium thinking it's the normal challenge and got a rock hard level. This turned me off from the game... perhaps call them "worlds" instead... with a brief caption of how difficult it is. With a picture of the world style.<br><br>3. Try making the hamster sprite rock gently and almost imperceptibly left and right as the speech bubble comes up - it will make him seem more alive. Put little shines on the buy and continue buttons to entice people to click. Everything is just a little bit too static. Small differences make big differences to people who haven't seen your game before.<br><br><br>I believe a little quality assurance and polish will make a huge difference. The game overall is nearly perfect but needs a few small but firm changes that are easy to do. In it's current state I will stake my reputation on you losing many sales over a poor choice of first level (see above, I started on medium thinking all were the same). Add a little bit more life to the gui and a little more get up and go. Streamline the options screen and definately streamline the turorial - there is no need at all to have 3. The less work for the user to learn, the better, so make the user do all 3 one after the other without any extra button clicks.<br><br>All in all, a great production that suprised me. I'd like to see it do really well. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you ran through all 20 easy levels on the full version before attempting the medium levels, they might not be so difficult.  Maybe in the demo, run through about 6-8 easy levels so the player can get a feel for what the game will do and one medium and one hard level so that the player can know what challenges are yet to come?  Just my opinion, I am in no way a marketing expert. :)<br><br>BTW, I've never heard of Monkey Ball.  Most of my video games are played on the PC.<br><br>One more thing, I really like this game and am considering registering it.

I just think it forces you to slow down and be more careful.  But there are times when you are fully in the circle, not going full speed and it still doesn't register because you are not in that exact spot.  In the camera tutorial, at the end it tells you to go to the end zone.  I walked over it again and again without it registering.  I finally had to force the hamster to stop in the circle, then nudge the hamster little by little til he was centered just right. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'll see what I can do about those suggestions. I'm surprised you consider the first medium level rock hard - I guess I'll have to consider making things easier. <br></div><br><br>I would have to agree.  But then I suck at these types of games.  Lemmings for example stymies me after about 10 - 15 levels.  :)<br><br>I found the easy worlds just that.  Easy.  Well...  I died twice on the third one because I didn't expect the pinball thingy to come whack me off the bridge.  And another time cuz I didn't know the platform was moving...  But other than that, pretty easy.<br><br>Medium...  tried it 3 times and gave up.  Got further each time but it still didn't seem like a gradual step up from "easy".  <br><br>Didn't try the other levels.<br><br>I will say that despite my suckiness I did enjoy it for the few minutes I tried it.  So much so that it might actually be the first blitz-made game I buy...  That 14.95 price is.......  enticing. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I don't think there is a level in the game that couldn't be created with the included editor.<br>There are 5 basic platform shapes; square, angle, outer curve, inner curve, and ring.  They can be combined together to form custom shapes such as doorways, discs, ramps, etc...  There are already some custom shapes included.  You can also import from a modeling program.  I haven't messed with that yet.  <br>You can create textures for the levels as well.  The editor comes with 2.  A green checkered texture (like you see in the garden level) and concrete, but you can add more as you go along.<br>You can create zones wich modify the behavior of the platforms; moving, turning, rotating, tilting, etc...<br>I'm still experimenting with what the editor can do.  It'll be fun trading levels with people and see what everyone comes up with. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
