It's Alpha, so play at your own risk.  It's actually pretty stable so I don't think you'll run into to much hassle.  I'd like to thank Matt from Banished Studios for hosting the web space for me!  :)<br><br>In it's current state works in hot seat mode.  It only supports 2 players right now. There is no IA, and the units need a lot of game ballancing.  Shows a lot of potential though and I really need to finish it considering how much work I've already put into it.  I actually took a 4 month break from it because it was totally burning me out.  But I've been thinking about it again, and I think I'm ready to go the distance with it.<br><br>Network play is out of order at that moment.  I will fix that soon.<br><br><img src="http://www.banished-studios.com/~craig/Screen1.jpg"><br><br>Demo: <a href="http://www.banished-studios.com/~craig/WarGameDemo.exe" target="_blank">http://www.banished-studios.com/~craig/WarGameDemo.exe</a><br><br><br>Some notes about playing...<br><br>*  When moving, the green arrows show how far you can move and still fire.<br>*  The Radar circle is the fire range of the unit.  not totally accurate at this point.  I think it's actually a little shorter range then what is depicted.<br>*  Enemy units will fire at you during your turn if they didn't fire the last turn and have moves left.  Just like X-Com.<br>*  When a unit is moving, it will stop if it spots an enemy. <br>*  Infentry can capture neutral building.<br>*  Buildings can manufactor more units.<br>*  Your primary resource is oil so capture those building first if you can<br>*  Don't use the mine layer.  There's a reason it's free :)<br>*  You win the game if you destroy all the of the enemy units.<br>*  Use the transports and transport choppers as soon as you can!!<br><br>Have fun, and give me feedback. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I was attempting an Advance Wars clone but, as most projects do, it ended before it began. So far so good, except for a few things that should be addressed, like, NOW.<br><br>1. The framerate seems like it's being help back by the BCF GUI library. I say you need to convert to a faster simpler GUI system (considering there's hardly a GUI needed in the game) like BlitzUI. That will allow you to make windows without titlebars for things like the mini-map.<br><br>2. The only differences between the Orange units and the Blue units is color. I'm not complaining about a lack of variety, I'm saying there's no reason the infantry on the Orange team shouldn't look like another HQ building when they show up fine on the Blue team. It's a simple Hue/Saturation change. If you aren't really a graphic designer, I can make the unit color changes in 5 minutes tops. My email is brody@... if you need 2D spritework (I specify 2D to imply I don't do 3D-like sprites).<br><br>Increadible work so far, Craig! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Right now I'm just using a combat result matrix.  Basically each unit has a strangth of 100.  I have a table that lists how much damage each unit damages each other unit.  I'm starting to not like this because it makes changes to the game machanics really time consuming.  I have to test a lot!  I'm thinking of using the "D&amp;D" route and using unit base and weapon system.  Perhaps the base has a strangth of 100 and a unit class like tank, or air, or whatever.  Then I could mount a weapon on a unit that affects those stats and classes respectively.  Sorry, I'm really just thinking out loud at this point.  If you guys who really like war games have any idea, please pass them on.  If anyone wants to get really brave, I can give you the excell spreadsheet with the battlematrix.  The game takes that file directly. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Nevertheless, it's turning out great. I want to see the game keep to Advance Wars' mechanics. My suggestions:<br><br>1. Units cannot attack at a range. It's annoying trying to transport units to flank an enemy when your APC won't move because it's afraid it'll be shelled.<br><br>2. Speaking of the APC not moving, it's increadibly annoying when I tell units to go to a certain place and they stop short for no noticable reason.<br><br>3. Capturing cities increases your income. Cities are just there to capture and provide cover and cannot produce infantry units. To build ground units (including infantry) you will have to select your HQ building or a military base that belongs to you.<br><br>The gameplay needs work, but what's there is looking good so far. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Basically, I'm loosing all the reliance on 2d sprites entirely.  Now the units will be generated with real-time 3D objects.  Also, the major frame rate problem, the fog of war, has been reengineered.  I'm hoping that that alone will nail a rockin' fast frame rate on everyones machine.  Plus the real-time elements stream instead of load all at once.  This means nearly no load time.  There had been significant interest in a play by e-mail mode.
