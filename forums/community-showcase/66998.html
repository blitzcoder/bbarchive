Ran smooth enough.<br><br>Mouse control just felt too slow and cumbersome to use.<br><br>Gameplay was nice and simple. The rockets seemed a bit slow. Other shots had usually destroyed everything before they got near.<br><br>The difficulty levels however are not to my liking. They seem to be harder not because of in increased level of enemy speed, intelligence or firepower, but rather just by a crippling of the firepower you have by making them take longer to kill. The result being that you can play for umpteen levels, not killing much, not increasing your weaponry or score, and not getting killed either.<br>I quit playing the hard level as I just got fed up rather than I got killed which in my opinion is not how it should be.<br><br>Oh and, I'm sorry but I can't ignore the graphics. The enemies look like they come from a completely different game to the rest. Its very odd. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

As I expanded the game with more backgrounds I started to include some more "realistic" backgrounds to show a progression (from earth, into space and towards the aliens's abstract planet). Unfortunately that's kinda lost by putting the first two backgrounds in the demo. Perhaps we should choose different backgrounds for the demo so it doesn't look so odd.<br><br>HUD: I like it simple like that. Doesn't clutter or get in the way.<br><br>Mouse Movement: Mouse movement is the same speed as keyboard and joystick movement, which was the idea.<br><br>Difficulty: They do have increased firepower, but yes the main factor is their increased hit points. No ones else has commented on this, but will keep it in mind.<br><br>Enemies from behind: Yes that's intentional - there's not many of them, but I have to keep you on your toes  :-)<br><br>Mouse out of window: Yes, I'm not 100% sure of that myself. Until very recently the mouse was confined to the window when you were controlling the ship. I do find myself getting confused at times with the new method - will see if anyone else has any thoughts.<br><br>Enemy shots: You can't shoot them, but the shield and smartbomb will get rid of them.<br><br>Anyway, thanks for the feedback  :-) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Came from a pretty random list of game-name-type words that I put together - Gun Wing stood out to me as being a "correct" description of the game (that is you control a flying thing that shoots) and it sounded like an old arcade game - which I liked. Sorry  :-)<br><br>And the old Eridani backgrounds are still in there, they're just a bit later on in the game now (they're not in the current demo).
