I could use a few people to help me test it though. No online testing would be required, so you can test whenever suits you. I do, however, want people who are serious about helping me test it and helping me fix or improve anything they find. If you know you don't want to or aren't able to help me test it properly, then please wait for an open beta, which won't be much longer anyway with any luck.<br><br>If you're interested, could you let me have your email addy and also the spec(s) of the machine(s) you would be testing on. I need to make sure I've got a decent spread of test machines. No point finding it's flawless on 10 nvidia test machines and bombs out on every ATI card when I release an open beta.<br><br>I'm happy with everything at the moment, but I may yet find something which causes me to put the beta off for a bit, so if you don't hear from me for a bit, it may just be that I got sidetracked working on something.

Seriously, I appreciate you letting me know, but Tokamak has been a huge pain in the ass throughout development of this game and replacing the pins with convex hulls would basically mean another three months of work, testing and retesting and finding workarounds to all the bugs and poor implementations that Tokamak would surely throw up all over again. ( No slur on Sweenie's wrapper.. I'm talking about Tokamak itself. )<br><br>It's taken me at least a month longer than it should have done to write this game, simply having to work, rework, fix and eventually workaround so many Tokamak bugs and problems. I've got it down to one nasty but non-game-affecting bug, and I'm not going to start all over again.<br><br>Besides, one thing I've never had problems with is the accuracy of the pins and how well they interract with each other. Possibly the only thing. ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

At least I found some of the latter challenges easier than some of the earlier ones, but I have only played through most of them once to ensure they were possible, so I may have just lucked out on the latter ones.<br><br>The problem is, if you don't make the challenges hideously difficult, they're ridiculously easy. It's remarkably difficult to find a middle ground, or in this case 100 middle grounds.<br><br>I have playtested them all the ensure they're possible, but I do admit that it took a long time to get them all. Having said that, I found a lot of bugs with the most recent version of Tokamak ( 1.2 ) and had to revert to 1.1, and I'm fairly sure I was using 1.2 when I tested the possibility, so I will have to go back and play through them all again &lt; sobs &gt;  to ensure they're still possible.<br><br>I've just playtested 3 and I almost got it third time. Eventually I got it after about 70 attempts, and even then it was luck, because I managed to bowl a straight ball around 25% from the left edge, dead straight, full power and it took down six pins directly, one of which rebounded off the wall, spun around on the alley and took out the remaining pin with it's last breath.<br><br>The "correct" or intended way of solving that challenge is to bowl the ball from right of centre, slanted a little left, with around 1/3 to 1/2 power and a lot of right spin, so that it just catches the left pins before spinning back pulling out the middle pins, which in turn drop and knock over the right pins. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If the way I solve the challenge is not the easiest, I may actually be hindering more than I'm helping if I make the helper show the method I used. Most of the challenges, I'm quite certain, can be beaten in multiple ways. Plus it doesn't really address the bigger problem, which is that they're just too hard. I'm toying with the idea of making the challenge game playable in Arcade mode as well as Sim. The extra speed that arcade mode generates, coupled with the ability to steer the ball after release ought to make the levels a bit easier, without reducing the difficulty of the challenge itself.<br><br>RE Difficulty : Hard to say. I've also had a couple of complaints that it was too hard. It's basically dependant upon how fast the bars move, at least for control method #1, and i was using a faster speed, more difficult setting before I released the beta. I figured the fact that I'd been playing it for four months straight had probably given me a skewed perspective on the difficulty so I easied it up a bit. It's trivial to make it harder if the general thrust is that it's too easy.<br><br>BTW, the CPU players on the hard difficulty setting regularly score around 230 and are capable of scoring 300. They also have some simple learning AI in there, so technically they'll keep getting better if you play well. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
