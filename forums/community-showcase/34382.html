Many other projects began as tests to see if I could accomplish other ideas, these grew bit by bit until I was comfortable. Rather than scrap the whole lot, I kept my half-finished projects 'on the shelf' :)<br><br>Once the main framework is complete, and there is a substantial code/media base, I hope the Open-Source part comes to the fore, and input from other coders etc. will benefit the project as a whole.<br><br><div class="quote"> <br>The thing that got me though was with the game concept itself, although comprehensive in covering everything that the genre has to offer you haven't really added anything new to it - so the question therefor is what do you want to get out of the project?

Personal satisfaction and the ability to play and enjoy the final result is certainly the major motivation.

There will be no transfer of money regarding this project. Yes, the visuals so far are quite dated, especially compared to Eve-Online or X2-The threat, but so far, I am the only artist working on the project. Just recently someone has begun making meshes, but it will be a while before these are all finalised.<br><br>In all, I am hoping that the project will attract others of similar enthusiasm who feel that they may be able to 'do that bit better' or 'make better sprites than that' etc. Although as stated, it is still in its infancy, and I dont expect much interest for what is currently little more than a flight-simulator. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
