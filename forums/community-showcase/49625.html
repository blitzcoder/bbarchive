The graphics are top notch, and it was fun to play. The slow acceleration was a little frustrating as it took so long to recover after making a mistake. Whilst going under bridges and into tunnels is a nice touch I did find myself driving blind more often than I'd have liked. It was especially troublesome before a corner as it was near impossible to position yourself on the racing line. Looking forward to seeing a lot more of this in the future. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Therefore I will be forced to use dummy names in the proper release.<br><br>The timer is reset to 60 seconds every time a car finishes the race. I will change this so that the round ends when laped racers cross the finish line instead.<br><br>About acceleration.In proportion to real cars they accelerate at the same speed in real life. if you were to film a car from above, it will look slow as well... but i wanred to keep acceleration and top speeds authentic, although I had to keep away from real physics as it really doesn't work well in that scale.<br><br>Collisions: These were sooo difficult  to sort out and to prevent cars from getting stuck and overlapped etc, i had to solve it this way. it is especially difficult in the LAN feature being developed.<br><br>Keys: You can change player keys in options menu. The reason arrows don't work in car maintenance  menus is because there can be two players active at the same time, one of them may have arrows assigned. But to laptop users, simpply remap the keys in options.<br><br>Game play: I am aware and expected that a fair amount of players would be unhappy about the driving experience, but i developed to what i believe is a compromise between simulated acceleration and speed in relation to real cars and making them drivable on arcady 2D maps that look nothing like true tracks with their 90 degree turns etc :)<br><br>Driving blind: You can enable transparent bridges and tunnels in options menu to make it easier to see where you are going :)<br><br>I appreciate the feedback, so please let me know - thanks for comments so far.<br><br>oh, and full release will be over 100 mb - but high res circuits and music comes at a size cost, but it will also be available on cd... and i could release an ugly 1 circuit demo with no music for those suffering from low bandwidth.<br><br>Regards,<br>Stefan <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

A couple of things, however.<br><br>1) There seems to be a bug in one of the tracks, the one with the train in the top left corner. On 3 occasions now, cars have go stuck sideways on to the road, this often results in a pileup which it is imposible to get through, forcing me to quit the race.<br><br>2) Collisions are very very hard to recover from. Indeed, if you get rammed from behind, you slow down, get rammed, slowdown etc. until the AI overtakes you. Its livable with, but annoying.<br><br>3) Music. Yes, I know you're into your club/trance, but not all of us are. Could it be posible to implement a simple mp3 player/importer to keep the rock and roll croud happy ;)<br><br>Other than that, you seem to have the makings of an A+ game. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
