I've been working on it here and there for quite some time.  I will be opening my own mud, hopefully by January 1st is my goal.  I will also Release this as a Mud Engine.  It will be extremely easy to edit, and add everything.  Read further below to see why/how.  I've got quite alot of work done so far.  But still alot to do.  I have the following done:<br><br>The Server is genealy complete and accepts unlimited connections, constantly checks for new connections and reads and stores commands.<br><br>All types have been defined, I thought about everything, and all the neccessary fields have been added.<br><br>The Character generator is functional, but will be edited for ease of use and editing.<br><br>You can logon, create a new character, choose your race,class, sex and enter the game, run a few basic commands, and move around my small town.<br><br>The following commands are complete: quit,recall,skill,spell,say,inventory,exp,Help,gossip,say,north,south,east,west,ne,se,sw,se,up,down.  And am adding more skills everyday now.<br><br>I have designed several areas, helpfiles,classes,races, and starting to work on objects now.<br><br>The reason that this mud engine will be extremely easy to edit,code, change, etc is how I'm loading everything.<br>For Example When It Loads the Areas It first looks at a file called "Areas.Dat".  Each line of the file Is the name of an areafile...say if the first line is camelot, the program then opens camelot.dat.  Then Adds the prestored data for each field, and each subtype room for that area, and so on.  This works the same way with classes(classes.dat), races,commands,mobs(mobiles/monsters),skills and spells.  And after i get the initial project fully working I will be creating a mud editor to control every aspect of the game.  Well heres some more info on the game.<br><br>Main Types- Area,Class,Race,Player,Mob,Object,Guild,command<br>(perhaps a few more to be added)<br><br>Subtypes- room,classkills,classpells,raceskills,racespells,<br>skills,spells,inventory,affects,alsohere,lyinghere,etc etc.<br>And more..................<br><br>Current Functions:<br>StartServer*   Not a function, but complete<br>MainLoop* N/Function complete<br>LoadRace* inprogress<br>LoadClass* inprogress<br>LoadMob* Inprogress<br>LoadArea* Inprogress,almost done<br>CheckNew complete-checks for new stream<br>readstream complete- loops thru each player if readavail<br>commandreader functional, but want to add player   controlled color and need to add "'s for spells<br>DispalyMenu complete<br>DisplayRace Complete<br>DisplayClass Complete<br>SelSex Complete<br>SelRace Complete<br>SelClass Complete<br>SelStatus Complete<br>Playing complete<br>Menu complete<br>BroadCast complete<br>Wholist Complete<br>Gossip Complete<br>SelName Complete<br>SelPassword Complete<br>VerPassword complete<br>VerName Complete<br>VerPassword Complete<br>Startup complete ...shows startup screen to new player<br>Logoff complete...quits/deletes the player and waits if ld<br>SelRace Functional/Nearly Complete will be adjusted<br>SelClass Nearly Complete but will be adjusted too<br>LoadPfile NotDone<br>SavePfile Notdone<br>SelectCommand NotDone<br>Regen NotDone ...health/mana/movement regen. I gotta wait till i write a timer for game control<br>Repop Note done...repops the area<br>Move nearly complete, nead to add too<br>Weather notdone will have random/non random weather in game<br><br>Well i think thats about it, not sure How many i Missed.  My first couple projects to work on is to get all the Loads finished.  Before I do a couple of things I need to finish loading all the types and subtypes. Which should take me another week, maybe two, depending on time.  Going to finish LoadArea, then LoadRace,LoadClass, then mobs, objects, guild, etc.  Then after such I'll move onto Load/Save pfile and fix Move to work with alsohere.  I'll also be making a future list of commands to do etc.  I'll keep you updated.  Expect the next update next sunday.  Maybe with some test files too.  Oh I'll give you some information on the Mud that I want to open.  So here ya go.<br><br>Race List- Human, Half Elf, Winged Elf, Wild Elf, Gold Elf, Drow, Orc, Goblin, Lizardman, Gargoyle, Duergar, Hill Dwarf, Moutian Dwarf, Deep Gnome, Tinker Gnome, Sauron, Half Dragon, Giant Ogre, Ogre, Half Ogre, Bugbear, Hobgoblin, Wemic, Troll, Wolven, Halfling, Pixie, Shadow, Centaur, Minotaur, Kender, Kelf, Half-Orc, Giant, Half Giant,Sea elf,  and need names for a desert race, human flying race,cat race, snake race,bird race...Also might add angels,demons,balanxs,dragons,cyclops, shrug.<br><br>Class List- Thief, Rogue, Assassin, Warrior, Barbarain, Swashbuckler, DragonSlayer, Archer, Witchunter?, Bard, Skald, Cleric, Priest, Druid, Crusader, Cavalier, Paladain, Anti-Paladin?, Necromancer, Illusionist, Invoker, Enchantor, Mage/sage?, Martial Artist, Ninja, Samaurai, Bounty Hunter, Shaolin Monk?,  Mystic, Bladesinger, Battlerager...and anymore Ideas?<br><br>Oh Well, thats enough rambling for me.  What do you all think?  Is anyone here interested in such an engine, or playing the game itself?  Lemme know: PortalMud@...<br>Take Care. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
