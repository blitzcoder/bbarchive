The full version contains over 6,000 questions, with more to come. Some features have also been disabled in the demo, including some elements of the Computer AI. The final demo will be time limited and have no feature limits at all. It will include all 6,000 questions.<br><br>I have made a lot of changes in the past two days, so there may well be small, harmless bugs. These are likely to be visual. This is also the first Glimmer Games product using BlitzMax, so there could be technical issues and incompatibilities resulting from that. Please report all bugs here, or in the thread elsewhere on CW.<br><br>The full version is ready to go, and will be released as soon as the feedback from the demo has been taken care of.<br><br><img src="http://www.animebowlingbabes.com/trivia.jpg"><br><br><a href="http://www.animebowlingbabes.com/trivianet_beta.exe" target="_blank">http://www.animebowlingbabes.com/trivianet_beta.exe</a> ( 4MB )<br><br><br><br>EDIT: Just making a note of the bugs and changes as they're done.

Also the different components don't align to each other very well - for example at the bottom. I would prefer if they would be made more in a fitting complement style.<br>-) i dislike the colour of the timeslider. It doesn' fit well into the rest of scene for my taste. Also the interface could need some nicer graphics. I apologize but it's not my style.<br>-) Music can't be turned off and on during the game. Maybe a click on the loudspeaker (is it one?) in the left lower corner. When playing music the box vibrates. Otherwise it doesn't.<br>-) The style of the music is somehow ok but it lacks an element which includes the left time, going faster, louder...<br>-) You also can't hear a change of the soundvolume if you alter it. Only after saving it changes.<br>-) Textalignment is a bit tight. Make some more space between the text and the corners.<br>-) I wouldn't have done the texts in the buttons so wild with upper and lowercases. It only makes reading more difficult in this case.<br>-) Clicking between the answers is also recognized.<br>-) Generally it wasn't clear for me where i had to click on: the text, the sphere? I also would have made it asymetric.<br>-) Why are there rollovers on the buttons but not on the rest of the interface? question-type (sin-scaling images for instance) and the answer-buttons (glowing)...<br>-) It also lacks some great feedback for good and bad.<br><br>Overall it feels very static. Just a little bit of moving elements would aerate it a lot. Well i hope this is okay for you and it helps. By the way if your coming from germany the questions are very hard.<br><br><br>Greetings,<br><br>taumel <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I won't clutter the post replying to each point, but I'll take a look at them all. I'm sure you're right that the questions will be a bit harder for people from non-English language countries. I wrote and researched the questions myself and I tried to ensure a good balance for UK, USA and Australia, but if I had questions about "Die Harald Schmidt Show", it just wouldn't fly for the US and UK, which are my primary markets. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Just to make sure nothing I've introduced recently has broken anything else. I'm not looking for feature-feedback at this point ( that will come post-release now ) but I do want to make sure this is 100% bug free and with 6,000 questions that's hard to do. If anyone liked the demo and is interested in buying it when it's released, drop me an email and we'll come up with some kind of pre-release discount. The point being I know I can count on people who have bought it to give it some serious playing.<br><br>If you're interested, email : info@... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
