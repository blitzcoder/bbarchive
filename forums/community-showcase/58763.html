This could be rounded errors or maybe just low FPS.  How can I see the FPS?<br>8) Instructions/Tutorial are too lengthy imho.<br>9) Your webbed version doesn't work for me.  I've told Indiepath.  But I get a lot of igLoader problems that noone else gets, don't know why, so I wouldn't worry too much.<br>10) Should the tutorial really add to the stats?<br>11) rotating planet on the front page is cool but looks a bit pixelly on the edges, so do some of the asteroids.<br>12) Exanding combo text e.g. x5 looks blocky.  So does the well done text<br>13) perhaps pause should pause the music too, in case the phone rings whatever.  Actually when I say pause I menu esc bringing up the menu OR you add a pause mode for when P is pressed (better maybe) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I did all the art myself, which is probably why some of it doesn't look as good as it could.<br><br>*edit*<br>1) This is to stop the user from dragging the window and halting execution.

At least you didn't come up with coment idea whilst on the loo ;-)  re: BMax1.10 The Latest Blitx Max still doesn't support a minimise button, you have to do that manually. re: setting it 60Hz. Well my desktop runs at 85 so Max will try to do an update every 60 by using timing rather than vwait, this explains some of the stuttering on the faster moving asteroids.  In full-screen mode there is no stuttering as it will be running at 60Hz.<br><br>btw, when you switch off windowed mode, it doesn't say "changes will applied on next restart" which would be clearer.  I guessed this and had to restart to get full-screen mode.  Dynamic changing of mode in game is better imho.<br><br>If you are interested, I've been developing a BlitzMax framework that handles loads of the stuff I've mentioned and more, and I'm considering selling it for a low price.

Your first ambitious mission is to utterly destroy all planets that have been marked for demolition under the new galactic trades laws recently enacted by the highest order of universal government, the Knights of Kizmar. You will not be alone on your mission. The Knights have sent a fleet of cruisers equipped with the very latest technology to accompany you. These ships, known only by their code name of Protowings, can harness the power you will need to complete your mission. Since your ship is built for reconnaissance, your task will be to direct the line of fire from the assisting Protowing fleet. Once activated, the Protowing's cannons will synthetically generate a comet. These comets have the destructive power equal to hundreds of nuclear bombs, no planet can withstand an assault from this astral rain of death for long.<br><br>Fulfill your mission quota by annihilating all ten planets, then you may be granted the position you have strived for since birth, the rank of acolyte in the Knights of Kizmar. <br></div>Hope that clears up some of your questions.

It lacks the necessary human interface quality assurance though.<br>I made that phrase up, but it explains what I mean.<br><br>Basically the experience of interfacing with your game is like using Windows 3.1 compared to Mac OSX. It's not a flame: I feel that you haven't really understood what makes a quality puzzler or casual title stand out and have a higher conversion ratio.<br><br>It should actually be amazingly obvious what to do without instructions for your target market, and in this respect your game fails on every level. I think the best part is it feels fairly original.<br><br>In detail, here's a few points where I feel your game stands to improve:<br><br>* the plot is just letters and words, it's meaningless and actually slightly offputting<br><br>* there is no characterisation like a friendly yet single minded alien mascot<br><br>* the menus are bizarre and unclear in design. You have filled in tickboxes instead of ticks in tickboxes.<br><br>* too many options<br><br>* The way it plays is absysmal. You require people to have a higher degree of concentration and actually click the shapes into the correct place. This is very counter-intuitive, people expect the shapes to fall into that place.<br><br>* there is no satisfying visual feedback such as the pieces teleporting into place with a particle system once you click - this means the user feels like there is no point to it.<br><br>* you should not have to click another button to target: clicking more-obviously glowing pieces to detonate them makes more sense and is more fun<br><br>There are many other problems but these are the chief problems.
