The polish and feel are excellent.  I have been watching your development for sometime (screenies posted here and there) and I was really looking forwards to playing it.<br><br>High quality graphics (those other levels look suberb too), superb characters, nice voices , sound fx, and music, great looking and very easy to use gui.<br><br>I love that the game does not give up on you after the timer has counted down, if you haven't managed to score yet - as happened to me a few times!<br><br>This game has everything... <br><br>...except a single player mode <br>...and useable controls<br><br>BOTH are needed to make this a hit game - and sell well!<br><br>But HEY!  Here's the good news, they're the easy bits to fix!  I wish I had a game this good looking which just needed those tweaks! <br><br>You should be VERY proud of yourselves dude, this game will rock with a few adjustments, but as it stands it is a little unfriendly to the user during the game itself.<br><br>Tweak the control system by making the character turn on the spot using the left/right cursor keys, make the character move forwards and backwards by pressing the up/down cursor keys.  Keep the jump, shoot etc as they are.<br><br>Do the same for both players, make life easier for the user, not harder - gameplay will be enhanced by making the users accessibility to the game and its features a lot better.<br><br>Perhaps add a single player game against the clock, closer in, lets have a look at these fab graphics, close up.  If you like add an adjustable camera make it always look at the character (in single mode I mean) and have it move towards the character for close-ups and away for wider shots.<br><br>Seriously, with those slight changes it will be much, much better as a game.  In single player mode, you could have the player two character simply sat at the side, watching shouting things at the player "Come on - is that the best you can do?", or "Rubbish!" or just laughing when you fall off and gulping when you pick up a wobble.<br><br>You've obviously worked hard on "Wobbles" (I love the name too!), it would be a shame to spoil that effort and dedication by leaving it in its current state.  <br><br>Use this forum as a sort of beta test then fix the few things that need fixing, and I think you'll have a winner on your hands.<br><br>Great work!<br><br>IPete2. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Very pretty but currently very frusterating.  For me the jump is the big frusteration.  Numerous times I seemed to catch on the higher ledge when I jumped.  Sometimes it'd take me 3 or 4 tries to clear the ledge on the jump.  Also, the jump is so quick that I frequently sent my player to a watery grave.  The biggest frusteration came from gingerly bouncing from place to place carefully collecting the little guys and then either slipping back and forth on the ice while trying to stop the movement and sliding right off or completely missing a jump due to the quick motion or imperfect character orientation.  A little more responsive controls, slower jump motion and a single player game and you have a solid winner of a game!!!  My $.02 <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The character needs to animate when attempting the run on the ice ... it looks stupid when you're pressing to move on the gamepad and the character just stands there and still speeds up ... which brings me to<br><br>2.  When on the ice and pressing a direction to move it's as if the character charges up and then launches as hard as possible ... you don't see the character animate and slowly accelerate until it's too much the character just goes from sitting still almost to launching off the ice due to some screwy friction to impulse interaction. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

What I do for this, is that while jumping, my character's speed (the amount with which he's moving forward, not the jump speed) is doubled.<br>Maybe jumping a little higher would also make it more playable.<br><br>Don't feel bad about these issues though, that's why professional games are tested a LOT before release. The game looks superb, and the concept is a lot of fun as well, it's just the controls and collision that's still off. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I will look into the issues. Nice fast screengrabs :-P<br><br>It's better for me to not change the jump height. The whole idea about Wobbles is that you collect green Wobbles to jump higher. In level 2, you can see that a platform with red and yellow Wobbles can only be reached when you have enough jump power. You can only "dump" yellow and green Wobbles, so the character is forced to wisely collect Wobbles. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Make it so you can slide up that ... maybe do a check for the surface normal of the the collision and check how soon jump was hit.  Don't cancel the jump if the button was pressed like 50 milliseconds ago or less and the surface normal Y &gt; .4 or something to that effect. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
