I hope Mark does not mind me posting this.<br><br>Introduction to event driven coding for games<br>---------------------------------------------<br><br><br>Part 1: Blitz2D, Blitz3D and polling<br>------------------------------------<br><br>The design of both Blitz2D and Blitz3D is based around a concept known as 'polling'.<br><br>The idea behind polling is that, in order for a program to find stuff out about devices like<br>keyboards, mice, joyticks and so on, it must continually check to see what the user is up to.<br><br>For example, a program such as...<br><br><pre class=code>Graphics 640,480,16,1
;
While Not KeyHit(1)
	mx=MouseX()
	my=MouseY()
	Cls
	Text 0,0,mx+","+my
	Flip
Wend
;
End</pre><br><br>...is continually polling the keyboard to see if the "esc' key has been hit. It is also polling the mouse <br>for its current x,y coordinates, and writing those coordinates to the screen.<br><br>This is a very simple and easy to understand technique, but suffers from a few drawbacks.<br><br>* The most serious drawback is that this is NOT how the underlying OS actually works, so it limits<br>how your program can interact with the OS.<br><br>* Polling is not very 'system friendly'. Since your program is constantly polling for user activity - and<br>therefore running - it isn't allowing other programs much 'CPU time'.<br><br>* It is not very efficient - why continually check the mouse when the user isn't moving it? The above<br>loop is executing 3 commands (KeyHit, MouseX and MouseY) that, 99% of the time, aren't really necessary.<br>Of course, that other 1%, when the user actually hits a key or moves the mouse, are VERY important!<br><br><br>Part 2: Event driven coding<br>---------------------------<br><br>An alternative to polling is 'event driven' coding. Although a little more complex, the idea is<br>really pretty simple.<br><br>Instead of your program constantly checking devices, it is instead 'told' about changes that occur to<br>the devices - eg: user hitting a key, moving the mouse and so on. When such changes occur, an 'event' is<br>generated and send to your program.<br><br>The basic idea when writing event driven code is for your program to sit there waiting for events to<br>occur, and then to study each event and take some kind of action based on that event.<br><br>For example, the example above rewritten to use events might look like...<br><br><pre class=code>Graphics 640,480,16,1
;
While WaitEvent()
	Select EventID()
	case $101 				;A 'Key Down' event
		If EventData()=1	;EventData() is the rawcode of the key
			End
		Endif
	case $203				;A 'Mouse Move' event
		mx=EventX()			;EventX() is the new x coordinate of the mouse
		my=EventY()			;EventY() is the new y coordinate of the mouse
		Cls
		Text 0,0,mx+","+my
		Flip
	End Select
Wend</pre><br><br>Why is this any better than the first version? It certainly looks more complex! Well...<br><br>* The event driven version is completely 'system friendly'. The WaitEvent command will cause the program<br>to come to a complete halt until an event occurs. While your program is halted, other programs the<br>user may be running can run freely without be interupted by your program.<br><br>* Its also more efficient; the screen is only redrawn when the mouse actually moves, while the first<br>version was constantly redrawing the screen. While its true that the first version could be rewritten to<br>achieve this, event driven code makes this kind of efficiency much easier, while polled code has a<br>tendancy to settle into a 'naturally' inefficient state!<br><br>* While the above only makes use of 'Key Down' and 'Mouse Move' events, there are a ton of other events<br>for your program to play with! This allows a much greater degree of communication between your program<br>and the OS.<br><br>A few other things to note:<br><br>* The meaning of EventData(), EventX() and EventY() depend upon the kind of event. Not all events<br>make use of all of these.<br><br><br>Part 3: Game timing using timers<br>--------------------------------<br><br>Ok, here's an example of using timers to control game timing:<br><br><pre class=code>Graphics 640,480,16,1
;
timer=CreateTimer( 30 )
ticks=0
;
While WaitEvent()
	Select EventID()

	Case $101
		If EventData()=1 End		;Quit if 'Esc' hit

	case $4001						;Event ID for a timer tick event...

		elapsed=EventData()-ticks	;EventData() contains the TOTAL number of timer ticks.

		For n=1 To elapsed
			UpdateEverything()
		Next

		ticks=ticks+elapsed

		RenderEverything()
		Flip False

	End Select
Wend</pre><br><br>Probably the only tricky bit to understand here is the 'elapsed' stuff, but all this is really doing is<br>calculating how many 'ticks' have elapsed since the previous timer event. 'elapsed' will usually be equal<br>to '1', but may be greater on some slower machines.<br><br>Note that this is perhaps the nicest and easiest way to handle game timing. While your program is waiting<br>for an event to occur, it is completely halted and other programs can run freely.<br><br><br>Part 4: Game timing using VWait/Flip<br>------------------------------------<br><br>This is a little more complex, but not much...<br><br><pre class=code>Graphics 640,480,16,1
;
Repeat
	While WaitEvent()
		Select EventID()
		Case $101
			If EventData()=1 End
		End Select
	Wend

	UpdateEverything()
	RenderEverything()
	Flip True

Forever</pre><br><br>Note how the WaitEvent loop has moved. This is necessary because Flip could potentially take quite a<br>while to execute, since it waits for vertical blank.<br><br>During this time, a bunch of events may have occured, so its therefore a good idea to 'greedily' examine<br>all these events.<br><br>Note that, although VWait/Flip based timing gives the nicest results due to frame-syncing, its not very<br>system friendly.<br><br>This is mainly because 'Vwait' itself actually uses polling! There's not much Blitz can do about this, as<br>Vwait is performed the graphics driver. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
