Like multitouch figer drawing app.<br><br>And within and house i realised that the way i approached it is totally wrong. I just draw thick rounded lines (rectables+circle) as finger moves. All points are put into an array of point object. Each onrender clear screen and redraws all lines.<br>As number of lines grow this becomes painfully slow. So, basically it is impossible to fully draw the screen. Even the idea is also wrong because it will becomes slower and slower if i draw above the already drawn lines.<br>It is bad, because i wanted color animation on timer, but i now i see that's impossible<br><br>So, I thought that a good way will be to draw somewhere else then create an image from that and on onrender just blit the image onto the screen. So, the overhead will be always fixed and will not depend on number of lines, points.<br><br>However, i don't see any way to draw into some other buffer except the frame buffer.<br>So, as i see it i have only one option: create my own drawing functions (for line and circle), draw everything in an array and then writepixels into an images.

You read the pixels.  Then you write the pixels to the image.  Then you re-draw the image (which means it has to get loaded into graphics memory).

However there will be some delay on the next render as it goes into graphics memory.<br><br>If it's slow it's slow, though I expect it is device dependent.  There are ways the issue could be ameliorated.  For a start, you clearly should never reset except when the user finishes a drawing action.  Maybe even use some clever algorithm to monitor his movements and make sure he has stopped for a certain fraction of a second.  There's also the possibility of using 'dirty rectangles' if the drawing is typically restricted to part of the image.<br><br>That said, I am only throwing out suggestions here.  Have you checked the speed of other finger-painting apps on your device?  You could also google for discussions of how to maximise the speed of such apps in any language - that might at least give a hint as to what has to be done.<br><br>EDIT: re-reading your post I see you have identified the problem as the loading the image into graphics memory.  I guess the only way to avoid that would be if you can use external code to get the data there more directly.  Don't know if that's possible or not, i.e. I don't know if there is a hardware pipeline from the frame buffer to loaded textures, or whether there's no option but to go through RAM. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
