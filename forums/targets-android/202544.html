Does anyone know what the problem is? Some ogg/mp3 sounds do play, some do not. On my Galaxy S2/S3 they just don't play but the game works fine (and other sounds do too), on Nexus 4/7 the game crashes entirely with the above exception. I think none of these things is correct/acceptable but I know too little about why it happens. Anyone have a clue ?<br><br>I also have random 'stalls' with my games on Android which are related to sound; if I load a few sounds in a row the app is 'stuck' (OS reports that it's stuck) ; when I debug it, it works fine because then they don't load 'in a row' but further apart which seems to be the problem.<br><br>Edit: Nexus 7 doesn't want to play any sound in Monkey and thus crashes on the thrown error in PlaySample. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Tested on 2.3 upto 4.2, also Nexus. The sound files are always recorded on audacity with stereo 44100 Hz and 32bit float, then exported to OGG files stereo on compression level 2.<br><br>In monkey I load the sound sources asynchron and wait for loading the next until the last has called back success. The app is waiting in a splash screen until all sound sources are loaded. I often play a lot of sounds together, but never the same sound twice at the same time. But in test I had only problems in HTML5 when doing that...<br><br>The sound sources are stored in an array and all fired sound will be stored in a TList to control them later. Each fired sound gets its independent Channel:<br><br><pre class=code>Class MySound Implements IOnLoadSoundComplete

	Global ChannelStep%=0
	Global Liste:List&lt;MySound&gt; = New List&lt;MySound&gt;
	Field Channel%,ChannelTimer%

		ChannelStep=(ChannelStep+1)Mod 8
		StopChannel ChannelStep

		Local loc:MySound = New MySound

		loc.ChannelTimer=Millisecs()
		Liste.AddLast loc

		SetChannelVolume ChannelStep,1

Nor does it explain while the entire internet is crying that SoundPool sucks and is unreliable :) <br><br>Anyway; first of all that loop wich is in the Monkey PlaySample code now blocks the UI thread, so I suggest replacing that with <a href="https://gist.github.com/tluyben/5472601" target="_blank">https://gist.github.com/tluyben/5472601</a> . I did and that's a whole lot nicer. <br><br>Then secondly; how do you you know if they have finished loading? When LoadSound was executed (it finished then obviously) executing PlaySound generates n times "Sample x not ready" (which, if you Google SoundPool is why everyone is crying about it). On the S2/S3 it shows it a few times, on Nexus 7 it shows it 100x and then doesn't play the sound.<br><br>My files are indeed 44.1kHz, 32 bit and compression level 2. They are also VERY small/short which is apparently the only thing SoundPool can do. Yet they work on S2/S3, not on Nexus 7 and I just tested Nexus 10 ; same issue. <br><br>So maybe if you can show me how you 'wait' for them ; maybe that's the solution. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you run it in a separate Thread and don't throw the Error it is fine and a minor issue. Now it's instable/app crashing behavior. <br><br>One of the sound files was over 100k ; I used Audacity compression to get it to 15k and didn't really hear the difference :) And then it worked.
