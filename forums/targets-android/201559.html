Only on Android though.<br><br>I'm hoping it's not a "float position" thing as it's tough to avoid those with the various display dimensions. Scaling the output to suit (with the transform matrix) will no doubt cause float positions behind the scenes.<br><br>It doesn't seem to be the usual culprit for this kind of issue, where an adjacent image in an anim/spritesheet is too close and bleeds over.<br><br>Instead, I've seen this happen on the edges of single images and on edges of images where there is nothing on either that side of the image or the opposite side. Sometimes it even appears all the way around a single image.<br><br>It kind of looks like the u,v texture coords are just fractionally off. But the lines don't appear to be any part of the image wrapping round or similar. The lines just look like weird dark (or sometimes light) streaks.<br><br>Strangely, it doesn't always seem to be the same images each time - or even to happen consistently.

And so far, the issue seems specific to Android (both emulator + real devices).<br><br>For reference, for this test app I'm using Android SDK Tools revision 11 (since R12 broke the snapshot feature).<br>I'm using a test device in the emulator with settings...<br>- Android 2.1-update1 - API Level 7<br>- Skin = built-in WVGA800<br>- LCD density = 240<br>- Max VM Heap = 24<br><br>But like I said, I've seen the same thing elsewhere on various real devices.<br><br>See below for the code.<br>You'll need a very specific image too, so place this in the "data" folder and name it "image.png" ==&gt; <img src="http://i.imgur.com/Kadtk.png"><br><br>I've seen this happen with other images of various dimensions (including power-of-2) some anims, some single images. For whatever reason, this image seems to show the issue most consistently in this test app.<br><br>Even having said that, sometimes when I build this app &amp; run it in the emulator, the weird lines won't be there. So if the lines aren't appearing, you may need to rebuild until they do. Really seems hard to track down what it might be.<br><br>I'm starting to think it may be some memory alignment issue or similar. Sometimes even just adding an irrelevant line of code or changing the package name in the CONFIG.TXT and rebuilding can make the problem appear or go away.<br><br>This is the reason I say to use that exact image. Also probably wise to just use the default "Monkey Game" etc. in CONFIG.TXT<br><br>Instructions are on the screen in the app. Basically it lets you cycle through several slightly different methods of drawing 3 separately-loaded copies of the same image.<br><br>The "line" seems to appear down the RHS of the image that is loaded first, regardless of the order the images are drawn in.<br><br>I've tried having 3 differently-named copies "image0.png", "image1.png", "image2.png" and that gives the same result.<br><br>If the image positions are rounded to Int's (as xlsior suggested above) the issue does indeed seem to go away. Unfortunately that's not very practical once you start transforming the output to suit different resolutions. The matrix transformations are bound to introduce float positions.<br><br>And I can't imagine why the issue would only affect the 1st image in this test app since they're all identical?<br><br>Here's a grab from the emulator, and I've enlarged the glitchy part to show the issue. There's nothing in "image.png" to suggest where that weird line might come from, other than the line seems to match the tallest part of the green arrow. But there's nothing down the LHS that could be eg. "wrapping around" the u/v-coords. And it's in such an odd range of colours too!<br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/CwTGs.png"><br><br>Here's the code anyway - any help much appreciated.<br>Thanks!<br><pre class=code>Strict

I've checked that "HICOLOR_TEXTURES=true" in MonkeyGame.java, but I guess that doesn't prevent the device using a lower depth somewhere along the way.<br><br>FWIW I used Paint Shop Pro 8 for all the images in the original app where I noticed the issue, and for the first "green arrow" example image I posted. I've seen various other apps (one I remember being Fireworks MX 2004) which save images with dodgy transparent fringes, so understand that problem. Haven't had it before with PSP8, and it doesn't look like that's the issue here either.<br><br>I guess I would have been surprised if defringing the image did solve it, because that wouldn't really explain why it only affects the first-loaded copy of the image. I can't understand why the other 2 copies display just fine, unless it's some weird bug with how the images are loaded (or perhaps how they are aligned in memory, as I suggested above).<br><br>Similarly, if the image itself was causing it, I might expect to see similar visible fringes when compiled for other targets - but all of HTML5, Flash, iOS &amp; XNA seem to display all the images in my original app just fine.<br><br>One bonus - interestingly, "defringe.exe" managed to compress my image better than PSP8, so I may have to use it again elsewhere :)<br><br>Still leaves me stumped though... :( <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

OpenGL should clamp these values, not sure why it isn't. Using GL_CLAMP will prevent this, but you have to assume a 1-pixel border for your textures.<br><br>Even the man page will state you'll get black edges appear on an invalid read:<br><a href="http://www.khronos.org/opengles/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/glTexParameter.xml" target="_blank">http://www.khronos.org/opengles/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/glTexParameter.xml</a><br><div class="quote"> <br>Similarly, if the width or height of a texture image are not powers of two and either the <br>            GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER is set to one of the functions that requires mipmaps<br>            or the GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S or GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T is not<br>            set to GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE, then the texture image unit will return<br>            (R, G, B, A) = (0, 0, 0, 1).<br>        <br> <br></div><br><br><br>The Second problem it could be is with glSubTexImage2D() wanting power-of-two. This is noted here:<br><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5086145/what-differences-in-opengl-rendering-are-there-between-the-atrix-4g-and-other-an" target="_blank">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5086145/what-differences-in-opengl-rendering-are-there-between-the-atrix-4g-and-other-an</a><br><br>That would be either an opengl implementation bug or an alignment issue. Mojo has pixel unpacking set to 1, and sets textures to power-of-two automatically-- so this should be ok.<br><br>I wonder if GL_PACK_ALIGNMENT should be set to 1 as well? It shouldn't need to be, but I wonder if some opengl drivers get messed up. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

(Note: do this at your own risk, etc.)<br><br>So in that function you'll see that there's two lines with glTexParameterx() with GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE. You can try GL_CLAMP instead to see if it adds in the border.<br><br><br>Secondly, you can try adding the line:<br><pre class=code>
gl.glPixelStorei( GL11.GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT,1 ); //this line already is in there
gl.glPixelStorei( GL11.GL_PACK_ALIGNMENT,1 ); //add this line

This means the left/top pixels are being correctly clamped by the hardware, but the right/bottom ones aren't (because the hardware can only clamp to the texture size, not an arbitrary rect).
