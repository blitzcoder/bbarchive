However, since around the time Mark implemented the new graphics engine for Android, none of my code examples (including a previously-working example) are displaying properly.  I've uploaded demos and used DDMS to try to determine the source of the problem to no avail.  I'm using a stock version of this device, and it should meet the minimum requirements (GLES 1.1 and 2.0 are supported, and the OS is Android 2.1 API Level 7), so I'm not sure what's going on.  <br><br>Here are the examples.  No scaling was done nor attempted in these examples;  the code accepts whatever the device size is.<br><br>nbFontTest:<br>Perhaps the simplest example, it uses DrawText and a custom font I created to display some characters on-screen.<br>What it should look like:  <a href="http://nobuyuki.gpknow.com/lab/nbFontTest/" target="_blank">http://nobuyuki.gpknow.com/lab/nbFontTest/</a><br>What it looks like on my device (captured from DDMS):  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/5qpuk.png"><br>What looks like is going on:  Texture surfaces for the font image are being improperly scaled by some tiny amount, causing bilinear bleedover from other characters.<br><br>ballTest:<br>This example uses DrawImage and SetColor to display some bouncing balls on-screen.<br>What it should look like:  <a href="http://nobuyuki.gpknow.com/lab/ballTest/" target="_blank">http://nobuyuki.gpknow.com/lab/ballTest/</a><br>What it looks like on my device:  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/lOh3t.png"><br>What looks like is going on:  Lots of flicker;  the balls only appear sometimes and show up some frames as glitches.  Accessing undefined memory space?<br><br>VecTest:<br>This example uses DrawLine and DrawCircle to display elastic collisions with vector maths.  DrawText is used to composite numbers on each ball.<br>What it should look like:  <a href="http://nobuyuki.gpknow.com/lab/VecTest/" target="_blank">http://nobuyuki.gpknow.com/lab/VecTest/</a><br>What it looks like on my device:  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/ISE63.png"><br>What looks like is going on:  I have no idea.  This one is completely broken!  Those filled blue shapes move around a bit, possibly anchored to one of the bouncing balls, but that's all that's displayed, if anything.  When switching back to this app, sometimes Cls blanking shows white bg instead of black (!)<br><br><br>Some more information about the graphics processing on my device (Samsung Moment):  It's based on the S3C6410, a samsung-built ARM11.  3d acceleration should be built-in (again supports OpenGL ES 1.1 / 2.0).  Devices which use this processor... <a href="http://pdadb.net/index.php?m=cpu&amp;id=a6410&amp;c=samsung_s3c6410" target="_blank">http://pdadb.net/index.php?m=cpu&amp;id=a6410&amp;c=samsung_s3c6410</a><br><br>Anyone else have a model similar to this?  I've tested these builds on the reference emulator, and had a friend test it on a Nexus S.  Both builds work just fine.  I'm guessing not many people have had this problem, or there'd be more reports... Still, this was a very popular device at one point, and I really don't want to exclude it from the manifest if it's an issue in mojo that can possibly be resolved...  Moreover, it's hard to test my builds on the emulator :)<br><br>I appreciate any input you guys can offer ! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The spinning inner contents (wireframe + images) are simply not there at all (completely black background).<br><br>Apologies I don't have an image - can't seem to get DDMS to recognise my device.<br><br>I've also put together a little app, similar to the "balltest" above. See below for the code. It's not doing anything special at all, but this gives the same flickering (of both the text &amp; the image itself).<br><br>It's almost as if every so often, one of the images being displayed is switched out for some random part of memory (so distorted parts of other images are drawn instead). In this case, the image appears to sometimes be replaced by what looks like a skewed part of the font image (just for an odd frame, a few times per second).<br><br>Interestingly, if I comment out the DrawText() the flickering goes away. However, in other cases I've seen the same flickering on this device when I'm not using DrawText().<br><br>I'm not sure where to find further details of the hardware in this device, but could it be a similar problem? The graphical corruption certainly looks identical.
