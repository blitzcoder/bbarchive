Class enemy
   field x:int,y:int,speed:int
   field image:Image
   field target:player
   Method Init()
      x=100
      y=200
      speed=4
      image="bla bla bla"
      target="such and such"
      addLast(enemyLayer)
   end method
end class
</pre><br>As you can see i have a command that add the enemy to a list.<br>Problem with that is that the list get initialised in the main function of the main program.<br>That list is also used by other objects.<br>How can i resolve the issue?<br>Is it wrong to import the main program into the enemy module?<br>Or should every module be self sufficent if possible?(to avoid multiple includes of modules already included somewhere else?).<br>Hope what i said make sense. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In Mike's book he does touch on it and I have been using his method, which is have all of your imports in a gameclasses file and then just import that file in your separate class files. One of the disadvantages of being self taught and learning from code snippets is you have to figure this stuff out on the fly. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There's efficiency in the build step, efficiency on a collaborative level and efficiency as an individual.<br><br>Project file organisation can have a significant effect on build times for large projects in some languages but that's unlikely to be much of a factor for most Monkey coders.<br><br>When working in teams, project file organisation becomes an issue because it affects both the ease with which a codebase can be understood (or broken down so a single section can be understood to work on) and how easily it can be worked on in parallel. A nicely modular codebase simplifies task breakdown and reduces branching and merging problems.<br><br>However, if it's just you working on a project then all that's left is your own ability to navigate and work on the code. To that extent the most efficient project layout is going to be a matter of personal taste. From experience most coders' tastes evolve as their projects scale and they find the limitations of their work patterns. <br><br>It should be noted that your IDE makes a big difference here. Unfortunately there are no Monkey IDEs that incorporate the templating/refactoring features that make it easier to both create and improve your structure. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
