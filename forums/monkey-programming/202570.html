Well, it is, it's just that it only happens once Main() returns!<br><br>This means you can only use stdcpp for things like trans that just 'do something then exit'. But given the current limited state of the os module (ie: no sockets or any 'blocking' operations so you can't really write 'server-like' stuff), that's about all you can do at the moment anyway.<br><br>My initial plan was to use the hans boehm gc with the stdcpp target, but I decided to wait until the Monkey gc matured a bit and see if I could use that. Well, I probably could, but likely at a bit of a cost to glfw apps. Also, I don't consider the Monkey gc finished yet - eg: I want to have a crack at generational gc soon, hopefully make it realtime eventually...<br><br>So if you need gc for stdcpp, the best approach at this point IMO is probably for me to add the hans boehm gc. I don't think this'll be a major hassle as I've already had experience at integrating it into bmx, but it'll make stdcpp projects a little more complex that just a 'main.cpp'.<br><br>But like I say, with a lot of simple 'do something and exit' apps, gc isn't really even necessary. What are you writing exactly?<br><br>Note that James' hack wont work, the problem being that local variables wont be 'marked' - this is the fundamental hassle involved in adding gc to stdcpp. However, it's a hassle that will likely need to be overcome for ALL cpp targets as apps get more sophisticated, at which point one gc for all will probably happen. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

At this moment, if GC is not available on the stdcpp target by now, it's not a drama. My project is in a very early status, so not a big problem, I can live with it for some months. I can go on with the project but, if you ask me,  I would love this to be as much compatible to c++ as possible in the future, so I supose at some point a proper GC for C++ would be more than welcome.
