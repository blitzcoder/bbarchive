Aside from that, the two languages are very similar. Other Monkey things, like overloading and interfaces, can be easily and 'natively' 'simulated' in BlitzMax, so I don't miss them at all.

It seems like a very bad fit, to me. Monkey is an excellent language and extremely useful...if you're willing to tinker and learn stuff about the platform you're targeting. But it's not ready to use out of the box.<br><br>Things on Steam seem to me to be packaged well, easy to install and easy to start using. Steam is targeting a mass market, people who want things to "just work"; Monkey is targeting a specific subset of developers who want to have a lot of possibilities and don't mind getting their hands dirty.<br><br>Compare with Game Maker, for example. Game Maker limits the amount of platforms it can target, and is very limited in what it can accomplish. However, it tries to give the user the possibility to just jump in there and mess around. (I assume. I haven't used Game Maker :) )<br><br>With Monkey, you can use the HTML5 target after you've installed it but it depends on which browser you're using, and it uses a built in web server that's...well...lacking. As soon as you want to try different targets you have to install a lot of stuff, mess around with a config file, restart Monky, etc etc. It all works, but it's not a simple procedure.<br><br>So, in short: I really like Monkey and I'm happy with it. But I definitely don't think that it's packaged well enough to have any kind of mass market appeal. Even if it was accepted into Steam it'd receive a lot of "WTF is this" comments, IMO.<br><br>But affiliation might be a different thing! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I've never enjoyed game development so much.<br><br>As for the name, I like Monkey.  It's the "Monkey Wrench" of game development.  1 Tool, multiple uses (targets).<br><br>I'd say it needs a logo change rather than a name change.<br><br>Regarding Steam - I'm of the belief that putting Monkey on Steam is a bad fit. It would be like releasing PHP, Java, or MingW on Steam.  Monkey and Mojo are really behind the scenes.  Someone downloading Monkey from Steam would probably be unhappy when they go to open it for the first time, and all they have is TED, a blank canvas, and a LOT of Target configuring to do and a lot of SDK's to download, install and configure.  <br><br>Tho I suppose it could be presented as such so there were no pre-conceived expectations.<br><br>@maltic Keep participating in the forums.  I can certainly move on from one unhappy thread.  I had to do a lot of work to get Monkey going on all targets too, but once I did.... HEAVEN.  IMO, there needs to be a step-by-step for each Target in a doc somewhere... someday.  <br><br>Kumbaya anyone? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

And even if you are in this as a hobby, you cannot deny that most game developers dream of making money with their games so they can quit their day job and spend their life JUST making games because it pays the bills.
