Sometimes a bug may show when you analyze a specific code structure you've not tested before unless you test the thing on several different coding styles during beta testing.<br><br>My idea behind this feature is -in a bit longer therm- to be able to add some pragma-like features to the IDE, such as support for overrides or overridable keywords-like in the code, to make the code easier to maintain and to make it easier to find some coding bugs. Typicial errors like hidding an overriden method because Monkey does force to override all methods with the same name to maintain the inheritance chain when extending classes, or using wrong case on a method overload, etc. This analyzer should also detect unused local variables and mark them as such.<br><br><div class="quote"> Also, to be frank, I really don't care about the feature being discussed in comparison to fixing existing issues like auto-completion's failure to handle generics. <br></div>Fortunately, those are not exclusive things and I'm working on improving generics too. Improving generics support has been a priority for some months, but I haven't yet got a fast enough implementation that do not have side effects. Now I'm working on a new approach that seems to be working much better than previous ones, by internaly using generic classes as if they were c++ templates, and generating in-ram copies of the original classes with all generic "resolution" pre-calculated. This seems to be fast enough, but it's not really stable jut yet, as soon as I have it stable enough, and if there are no additional unexpected issues, I'll add this new Monkey parser to Jungle Ide. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Meanwhile, as an IDE, Jungle's auto-complete falls short, the formatting still breaks regularly, it has no refactoring of any kind, no helper features like add interface/abstract skeletons, no basic navigations like find references or find children and outside tool integration is just starting to get a look in. I'm very sure you make little to no money from Jungle and I'm not demanding anything but I just don't get where you're going. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In short, all the features you miss are reduced to the same issue, which is why I'm trying to improve the generics thing. Providing reliable find usages or refactoring requires the AST to include all generics information, no matter how complex they are, and I'm still trying to get that right. Once I get the internal API to solve all generics details, I would love to add some proper refactoring tools. But it's a slow process as I need to also concentrate in regular support, and other areas of the IDE.<br><br>As instance, this Hidden thing, is part of a custom development request by Playniax, for their Ingnition framework and I plan to use it too on JungleGui module too. I understand what you say, and I agree with you, it's not that we are not focussing on that, is that it's not yet ready, we've done several implementations of it, and none was good enough to work reliably and fast. But, obviously, it's important for me and for some Jungle Ide users like you, and I hope to have better support for Generics soon. Then, if generics work as expected, we could get a reliable enough binding solver to provide safe refactoring tools like that ones you're describing, which is something I would love to add to Jungle Ide. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So you alt-tab or whatever away from Jungle, come back, try using the scroll wheel and accidentally change the target. It's an annoyance that rates about on a par with tabs being full-screened when I'm just trying to click back to a file because the double click detection is too sensitive and there's no tab scroll function. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
