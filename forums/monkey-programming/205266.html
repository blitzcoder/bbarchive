I'm usually a miser, so most engines I haven't really looked into much because the effects and features didn't impress me for the price.  <br><br>In terms of features, anything that can create multi-stage emissions easily and readily is good in my opinion.  Most seem to approach this by using some sort of a timeline, but there are some which use super-emitters instead of or in addition to that, which is pretty cool. <br><br>When choosing a particle engine, you gotta see them all as pretty much somewhat complicated finite state machines (think OpenGL 1).  What am I going to be able to do with this thing?  Will it do everything that I want it to do?  How do I create the patterns -- with code?  A GUI editor?  Some sort of IDE hybrid?<br><br>I always used to write my own little hard-coded bursts for whatever job I needed, but when progressing to something more generic, I found out that it's quite a large undertaking.  I think that having a clearly-documented, and very expressively definable open source library for particles would be a boon, but again; finite state machines.  There's probably never going to be a quintessential one of those, and everyone's gonna want one that does certain things a certain way for convenience, or their thought process is simply locked into a certain design pattern which tells them that a different way would be better.  <br><br>It's my hope that the system I'm designing will catch on, and people will eventually help extend it for me.  I plan on writing a small editor for it eventually, to make it easier to use and generate code with, but that will come later.  Right now, it's extensible enough for my own needs.  Emitters which are also particles can drill down n-levels deep for as complex an effect as need be;  there are a few events that can probably be added (such as when reaching certain percentages of ttl like 1.0) to stretch this out a little further for user convenience, but otherwise I imagine most of the limitations will come from extending the tweenable values available and the lack of easing.  (Right now you have to extend an emitter of your own to modify extended values manually from outside the particle itself.)<br><br>If you're interested, you can take a peek here:  <a href="http://www.monkeycoder.co.nz/Community/posts.php?topic=5255" target="_blank">http://www.monkeycoder.co.nz/Community/posts.php?topic=5255</a> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
