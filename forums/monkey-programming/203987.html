(link to HTML5 example).<br><br>The parts I think need definitive running examples (or footage of a running example) are...<br><br>A world created with the world editor being played from within a game.<br>A game character that uses an animation created with the animation editor being shown within a game.<br>And again, an example of a collision polygon defined in the physics editor being used in game.<br><br>I think having these would help give those who are not currently sure how it would be used but are interested, an idea of what to expect. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I don't know what your competition is like for established products in the field but the target money seems kind of high for a niche market (?).  You don't have to defend it I'm just seeing a lot of kickstarters in game development software not getting even close to their kickstarter targets.  :(<br><br>Just to confirm, you are providing a tool which (among other things) makes it easy to procedurally animate characters in a game from bits of sprites?

I'll be waiting for a later beta to test the demo of this, but I like what I see!  I hope the hooks for your rigging API are just as easy to use and useful as your tween class for monkey.  Too many monkey libs try to do too much at once and don't have good modularity, end up being engine frameworks, etc.  This looks super useful (and more importantly, flexible) for simple needs. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Do you expect your sprite creation component of the tool to exceed what brashmonkey is doing with Spriter?  I know there are ambitious plans for Objecty for a full 1.0 release but how soon would you expect Objecty to be usable as just a sprite animation tool?  Of course as a Monkey developer, Monkey support would be a high priority, where does Monkey support fit in for you? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you have noticed Objecty wont be hitting the kickstarter goal soon so regrettably I am having to re-evaluate the project plan. It sucks to have to do it but it really looks like I'm going to have to put a public release on hold until I have more money and time to put back into development!<br><br>To answer your question directly, I would definitely look to improve on what existing tools are doing. Objecty currently in an early alpha stage offers most of what spriter offers and more! One of the major areas that needs work is improvement of the UI for animation as currently it is quite stark and not obvious as to what features are available. For example you are able to swap out bone images, but you access this from the propertygrid on the left (not very intuitive). This was all planned as part of development after kickstater.. but...<br><br>It sux and thanks to everyone for the massive support in where it got to. Based on the numbers and balancing the need to keep the business bringing in money, I will have to postpone any release.. BOO! :( <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It is pretty soul destroying to have to make a decision to hold it... but I need to think of the £££ a bit. I had thought about preorders but I need to look at the response I have had and that has been most people clearly need to have Objecty further along then it is to buy into it. People already have alternatives to Objecty so unless I can let a user test it in their engine today, then I miss a sale. I could potentially burn through all the initial pre order cash and then back to square one needing another boost. Its a difficult situation and the only decision I feel to be right is to make the hard one to put it on hold until there is more spare money in my company.<br><br>I still have a feature in developer magazine coming next week but unfortunately a week or 2 late. damnit! I am not sure what success rate it will have but it will at least be interesting now after the campaign finishes, to see how many extra visitors will show up on the project page.<br><br>Oh the campaign originally was gonna be on indiegogo but then they announced the UK Kickstarter launch. To be honest kickstarter is a massive gamble and unless I had a mainstream/consumer style product I would not risk crowdfunding. There are better less stressful ways to make money. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
