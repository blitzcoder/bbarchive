I'll pin this and update it every now and then...<br><br>After thinking over what BRL vs 'the community' should be doing, I have decided BRL should take on more of the '1st party' stuff - in particularly, ads and IAP. These are two pretty fundamental features of free/cheap mobile games these days, and since Google, Apple and MS all offer 1st party solutions for these it makes sense to have them built-in to Monkey as much as possible. For 3d party stuff like flurry, chartboost etc, I'll work on making the 'native' Monkey APIs easier to use and more flexible so that it will hopefully be easier for the community to provide their own solutions.<br><br>Mojo3d is already in development - although it may not be called that once it's finished. The basic idea here is to provide a simple, immediate mode, low level 3D API that people can use to write higher level stuff with, for example, a backwards compatible Mojo driver capable of enhanced effects/custom shaders etc. Currently, I am aiming for compatibility with all targets capable of gl2/gles2/d3d11. More on this is it develops...<br><br>Anyway, this is a bit brief but here we go:<br><br><div class="quote"> <br>Short term:<br><br>* Https support for HttpRequest android, iOS, win8. C++ later...<br>* IAP for android, iOS,  win8. <br>* PubCenter(?) ads for wIn8.<br>* Googleplay gamecenter?<br>* SetDisplayMode for xna.<br><br>Next up:<br><br>* Android NDK target.<br>* 'Mojo3d' - simple low level, gles2-ish 'immediate mode' 3d module for android, iOS, win8, html5 and glfw targets.<br>* 'Mojo2din3d' - backwards compatibility wrapper for mojo with additions, ie: 'mojo with shaders'.<br><br>Ongoing:<br><br>* Fix android audio limitations issues.<br>* Implement better png/jpg loaders for C++ targets.<br>* Solve delete .build dir issue, probably via version info in TARGET.MONKEY. <br>* More work on Modman - dependancies, sub repositories, module sub dirs etc.<br>* Improve/document native APIs to make it easier for people to add 3rd party add ons.<br>* Factor out a bunch of app config settings, e.g.: APP_LABEL, APP_PACKAGE, APP_IDENT, APP_ORIENTATION etc.<br>* Implement app renaming in a consistent way across all targets.<br>* Rewrite remaining bmx tools in Monkey - ie: rebuildall and mserver.<br>* Glfw3 target.<br>* WebSockets.<br><br> <br></div> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Seems like there isn't a clean way to do this across targets? <br><br>'Networking' is one hell of a broad term! What sort of games are we talking about? <br><br>Tcp/udp are in there for most targets, the notable exception being html5 (and xna/flash, but I consider them lower priority - more on that later too). WebSockets then become the obvious choice - which I *assume* can be implemented with plain sockets - but these are tcp based which might not make them appropriate for 'twitch' games? Dunno, been a while since I did any serious network coding, and it generally involved udp tailored to the game.<br><br>So...what do people want networking wise? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I don't know current C++ GC status, but I don't remember it preventing memory fragmentation and on small devices this is a nice plus on the Java side. Not sure if this is something very important or not, and if this is properly reduced by making full collection on a per-frame basis or the like, but there's something sure, the Androi Java GC has been much more than tested, and that's something we should benefit from. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If they can share the core implementation, they should have a more consistent performance and memory presure on collection, etc. I still think comparing both methods in the same device can be very interesting to get a real comparison. I supose Dalvik GC is not really designed for realtime applications. I do not mean to say that Monkey uses a realtime GC on C++, but it feels "very" realtime.<br><br>I may be the only one that sees small pauses every once in a while when developing Android games? I have always thought it is the Garbage Collector or the audio engine, but not 100% sure and it was almost unoticeable, so I haven't bother investigating any further. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That was over my expectations VERY good news for us targeting mobile, amazing! Thanks! And thanks for the roadmap as well, seems very good to me :)<br><br><b>On the network side of things.</b> What we have currently looks great, only html5/flash miss out. Multiplayer mobile &amp; web-games is an attractive indy market. Check this out: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/stickrunpage" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/stickrunpage</a> - 4.7 M likes, and now you go play the game, is multiplayer the defining factor maybe? ;)<br><br>A lot of games and apps don't need action packed network traffic, TCP can be enough. Consider World of Warcraft is TCP (released 2004) and is quite realtime-ish according to me.<br><br>Html5 WebSocket support should be simple to wrap considering how small the API is, or? Targeting html5/flash is also very nice for client-testing purposes. For html5 (as a client) to connect to a server we only need to read a header and some pack data? Flash has socket support and their API also seems quite simple?<br><br>So my wish is that we get Client-Side TCP-only support for flash &amp; html5. Then let the community handle the higher level stuff like wrapping it up in a easier to use interface.

However, if you want your game on Steam, OpenGL isn't such a bad choice. Steam is more of a gamer community than a casual community, and even the more casual users have good enough support for OpenGL. It really depends on where you're looking to sell your game.<br><br>The XNA target isn't a bad choice, but .NET has been known to be annoying to deal with, but places like Steam have users download 'redistributables'. So, either way you'll have issues, but XNA may be less of a hassle to you.<br><br>You could always have two different EXEs for your game (Probably chosen via some kind of 'launcher'), one created using GLFW, and one using <a href="http://monkeycoder.co.nz/Community/posts.php?topic=4806" target="_blank">BlitzMax/MonkeyMax</a> or <a href="http://monkeycoder.co.nz/Community/posts.php?topic=5439" target="_blank">Ferdi's PopCap target.</a> (For now at least)<br><br>As for screen changing in XNA, you could either wait for Mark to add it, or you could find some examples and use 'Extern'.<br><br>There are plenty of games on Steam which use XNA (Terraria, Magicka, etc). However, if you used GLFW (And you're using Steam), you could support Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows, which would cover everyone on Steam. Supposedly XNA and C# can run on OS X and Linux via Mono, but I don't know enough about MonoGame to really suggest it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Perhaps an "indie game" would do better on Android. I have friends who'd done great on it.  Also, yeah I am planning to move away from casual download games for desktops but moving into indie download games instead (iOS is OK but peanuts compared to my PC revenue). So whereas I might not need to support so much legacy stuff for old casual gamer PCs, I'll still need Direct X support and a solid PC/Mac/Linux solution.  I was rather hoping Monkey could be that...<br><br>@Sonickidnextgen A friend recently released a game on Steam and got so many issues with OpenGL (lack of drivers) that he has decided to convert the game to DirectX instead. This is what I found years ago in casual download games but hoped Steam user would be better (more able to use OpenGL), but it still seems that DX is safest which is why Monkey needs a decent DX target.  Sounds like going through the BlitzMax target is best for now then, but it sounds a bit convoluted... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'm in the middle of writing a module, and like many others, I've reached a point where I have a super class which needs to keep things private, and a derived class which needs to access private members. Normally I'd just use 'protected', but since that isn't a thing in Monkey, I'm forced to make things public.<br><br>Right now, the two best solutions I can think of are; keeping pretty much everything public, or using private abstract properties and having the fields in the derived class. The latter being far more realistic, and to some extent quite useful, and the former being bad practice.<br><br>In Monkey, the answer to this is usually the less organized 'All-in-one module' approach, where you take advantage of the classic Blitz styled 'Private' functionality. However, this could be avoided if we just had a 'Protected' directive.<br><br>You also have to take note that not all situations are solved by this method. For example; the module I'm working on requires users to create their own classes which derive from a base class in a module I've already written.

I think as long as I'm using the programming just for fun in my spare time. And herein I think is one of the strength of MonkeyX (beside the price).<br><br>But on the other side, there are some weaknesses where the other frameworks getting better and better. <br><br>First of all - again my opinion - is the very weak documentation. If Mike is stepping ahead and may write a new book with examples of the usage of the different functions, it isn't that big of an issue anymore. I'm using now Monkey for over an year (and I was never disappointed) but only slowly gain more and more momentum to find the various functions through a lot of try-and-error. This shouldn't be the case for any good language!<br><br>Second, I think alot of us are building their own framework with the same functionality (e.g. TileEngine, GUIs, etc) or using an existing one. Again, if we are not using an framework like Diddy or Ignition, we re-invent the wheel most of the time. In my opinion, there could be modules available maybe as plugins to better utilize the framework. This is again an area where compititors are getting better and better. This means, prototyping is faster in other frameworks as it is in Monkey. <br>Maybe with a better organisation of the different available modules from the website (or like JungleIDE is handling it with the modules) this would enhanced as well.<br><br>Third - as EdzUp was mentioning already - the roadmap should be updated more regularly. I don't think anyone would mind waiting for something as long as we know when to expect something. And if somebody couldn't wait, there is still the possibility to write their own library.<br><br>Long text short - I really, really enjoy Monkey-X, but I had already several times the idea to switch to another framework as it maybe would provide faster progress. And if you would do it for business reason where time is money, I think even if other tools are more expensive, in the long run it will be cheaper as it has enhanced productivity.<br><br>my 2 cents<br>Wyl <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I noticed that most of the updates are bug fixing, more or less twice a month... I guess it's because a big thing is coming (Next up?). I also think that a time estimation will even help to hold Monkey users that are thinking in change to another framework since there're no big changes, or in other words... it feels like MonkeyX is not growing up / evolving.

I personally feel better when a product communicates with its community than not.<br><br>My quick thoughts:<br>- i'm surprised Monkey didn't charge for the IAP modules.<br>- the numerous options available to game programmers makes it difficult for Monkey to compete (Unity, Construct, GameMaker, etc).<br>- the IDE is fine, but you could have scooped up Mollusk or Jungle to offer a package deal to help make a more professional package. (also helps with delegating work)<br>- make shorter, easier milestones to help keep the "enthusiasm" up. ie, release Mojo-x in stages for each platform group.<br>- silence is deadly. makes a product seem stale. newsletters, blogs, interviews, post-mortems, help keep the community and word-of-mouth alive.<br>- the site re-do was a positive. you may not think it helped with sales, but it may have helped with perceived value of the product for those who are doing the word-of-mouth. also, the site re-do and monkey-x push could have been bigger.<br><br>For the community's assurance, I don't see Monkey going anywhere, it's a great idea and product that can survive a lapse or two. i'll still keep up miniB3D, fwiw.<br><br>But i do recommend that you, Mark, find supplemental income. it will help revive your perspective on Monkey when you apply your skills elsewhere.

And I am sure he had some conversions since we have the free version. As a one man show, he is not able to live on that???? Newseeland must be very expensive. I can't imagine it is really the money thing but more a motivational problem again. He was there before and reading his blog post gives me the same vibe. Btw. I think with his "outing", he put the nail on the sales coffin right there. I would not buy Monkey now, knowing that its creator is on hiatus ones again. <br><br>About word of mouth, I agree. As an extension to BRLs own marketing activities. Which look like none existant. Did I do my share as a user? I think so. My book got into the hands of people over a 1000 times at least. My guess is way more as it was available for free for quite a while. Plus being on warez sites too. That was quite a publicity right there. I am thankful for gotten the chance to work on it. Without Monkey I would not have been able ot do this. And I still went on to support Monkey by maintaining/developing my framework and hinting Monkey a lot on other pages. <br><br>But...<br><br>... how slow things developed in the last time, my guess is, Mark didn't work regular working hours on the tools. At least not 6-8 hours a day. Mostlikely less. Man, I can only imagine what someone could have created working fulltime for one year on a product. A lot. But if you don't work on it, then a product looks dead. If you don't communicate, it looks dead. Just putting it out, doesn't work. The new website was nice but dull imho. Brown colour sheme!!! We have the only game dev releated website with a colorsheme that fits more for a old wood funiture store than a game dev site. And it has quite a few technical problems too. Taking this and the recent development of Monkey, it feels all together like some patch work. But not really like things are growing, improving, etc.<br><br>I am thankful to know now that Monkey has no future. Why do I think like that? Cause of what Mark has posted. It is the first official sign of things go wrong, goidn to stop. And it never fails to judge the outcome. Yes, people (us) can work on Monkey too. I know, I said that before too to convince people. But what is the expectations from the users? That there is an official solution. Supported by BRL. That is what the people want. Not something that is patched by a bunch of people who can't think as one as everyone see their needs as the most important ones.<br><br>Me being mainly a support programmer who needs a growing product to be motivated and have a growing user base to work for (for free), I will seriously question myself now, where I put my efforts into. fantomEngine gets downloaded 200-300 times each version. So I think I have a few users here and there. But if the creator on the main product (Monkey) does not want to work on it, then why should I support it (for free). Got stuff to think now. Maybe Unity is really the key here which a lot of people are hinting these days. Who knows.<br><br>To Mark: Sorry to be blunt, but do yourself a favor and find a nice job outside dev world hat supports your living. Don't create another dev tool. You are an awesome developer and really created great products. But people put their hopes/work/money/hours/etc. into your products and once again, you will leave them standing there. Wish you all the best for your future. Am I dissapointed? Hell yes, as I put quite some effort into Monkey. And the output was not worth the effort now. But that is my fault :-) Thanks for the good ride. Had a good time. But with your outing, for me you put Monkey into a coffin. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Point and click game making and scripting for an engine in my view isn't true programming. These are tools for people who have little or no knowledge of programming. <br><div class="quote"> - the IDE is fine, but you could have scooped up Mollusk or Jungle to offer a package deal to help make a more professional package. (also helps with delegating work) <br></div>I haven't used Mollusk so I cannot comment on this IDE, but the IDE has to be able to work with Windows, OS X and Linux or there is no point to it. Modifying Code::Blocks may be a solution here.<br><div class="quote"> - make shorter, easier milestones to help keep the "enthusiasm" up. ie, release Mojo-x in stages for each platform group. <br></div>Not too sure about releasing Mojo-x in stages for each platform. It could lead to inconstancies. The biggest problem with cross-platform libraries is when something changes on that platform. Apple are bast**ds for doing it every time there is a new update of OS X or iOS.<br><div class="quote"> - silence is deadly. makes a product seem stale. newsletters, blogs, interviews, post-mortems, help keep the community and word-of-mouth alive. <br></div>So true. But I still think that the name 'Monkey' wasn't a very good starting point to begin with. People will know of BlizBasic, Blitz3D, BliztMax. A name along the lines of BlitzX or BlitzBasicX would have been better.<br><div class="quote"> - the site re-do was a positive. you may not think it helped with sales, but it may have helped with perceived value of the product for those who are doing the word-of-mouth. also, the site re-do and monkey-x push could have been bigger. <br></div>I don't know, I think it should have been more colourful. Brown and beige are just too bland and the icons are too Windows hate-ish and iOS 7-ish in style. The site could have done with a better way to browse the apps section and maybe a forum that's phpBB.<br><div class="quote"> - dont' start with any Monkey-2 project, at least until you dont' understood what's going wrong with the current one. <br></div>Yes. Starting something else without fully understanding what's going wrong with a previous venture will lead to disaster for the next project. Any future code should be written with 64bit compilation in mind.<br><div class="quote"> - Monkey has too much targets: keep alive only some, the most remunerative ones (I think Android, iOS &amp; derivates). Desktop, Flash (? I dont know), PSM etc could be put in standby or became paying target. With fewer targets, you have more time and extra-time will be (hope!) monetized. <br></div>Yes there are too many Targets to deal with. In my opinion HTML,DESKTOP,ANDROID,iOS and maybe WinRT should be the ones to concentrate on. XNA is virtually dead if it isn't already, Ouay, PSM maybe but on the back burner or paid targets and I give FLASH maybe 5 years before it too is finally killed off as it has for Linux already.<br><div class="quote"> - new Monkey modules: Monkey is targeted ONLY for games: it misses a UI (native) modules (like MaxGUI at the time). Maybe there are users that dont want to create the next flappy bird clone... but the new Telegram? If I want to create a non-game app with Monkey, I will found it very difficult and there are better solutions out there. <br></div>Yes the lack of a native GUI framework is a bit of a killer. The problem here is which targets, and will it use the OS's native rendering system or use a ready made frame work such as Qt/wxWidgets. Both Qt and wxWidgets frame works have advantages and disadvantages, either in what platforms it can run on and license issues. My view on this is to write a wrapper for Qt or wxWidges for desktops and as a paying native module for other targets.<br><div class="quote"> - you have not only Monkey in your pocket... you could see if there are some 'market niches' to fill with your actual resources (ie: BlitzMax modules?

I don't think that there are already available any fully cross platform 3D engines out there to even consider writing a wrapper for. The only free one that comes close is Ogre with support of Windows, OS X, Linux, iOS, Android and WinRT. But Android and WinRT as in the Ogre 1.9 RC 1 unstable branch.<br><br>As a sideline, think about writing some games with Monkey and getting them out there as a source of income. They can also double up as advertising. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There are surely other possibilities to finance this. Do not think of expenses at first. If your expenses are not getting funded by sales (afterwards) you might think about the whole thing again: that such a programming language might not be the thing "all" want today. So if you are in a niche: raise the price - but also raise the support, possibilities -&gt; "benefits for the user". There is also the option to free everything but be one of the module producers - with your modules being not free but available for some dollars. So people can do everything on their own (your language has to provide the possibilities - the user the "logic") - or to save time, they buy your module. Also provide "commercial support". <br>All in all it is not easy to get "newcomers" on board - "serious" developers wont say "hey, lets try monkey for the next AAA game". The only audience you could try to convince are hobby coders (doing things for themself - but they wont buy a "package" just for some coding experiments -&gt; all free except pro modules) and indiedevelopers knowing BlitzBasic/BlitzMax/... already. Monkey does not provide super features no other multi-target-devtool has, so the honest truth is: the reachable audience is already limited. Maybe there is a chance to convince "non coders" with easy-peasy-tutorials à la "even YOU can be a coder, let your dreams come true". Of course you cannot have something like the Flash-Editors which enabled "artists" (graphical, sound...) to create small good looking games but maybe you find a way to convince "newbies" to give monkey a try.<br><br><br>bye<br>Ron <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I feel a little uneasy working with a framework/language that has an uncertain future. [posting the original message itself will surely put off new users - I suggest it is edited/clarified]. <br><br>Personally I don't mind that monkey gets new features a little slowly. I'd rather it is stable across platforms, and not endlessly changing to add fancy features (like some frameworks I could mention).<br><br>@dragon has already suggested some of what I was thinking. Don't be afraid to make some changes. Change the payment method to have a fee for yearly updates (maybe $25) -- this is entirely appropriate, imo. You can't support a product like this for nothing!! Start it from this summer. I think paying for each feature/target would get a little messy? <br><br>If the main problem is (still) getting the monkey message out there, I expect marketing is partly the issue - Sorry to sound boring.... Maybe just more ad spend, but also contests and targeting more game jams, interviews, articles.<br><br>Ultimately, the demo version still can't let people see monkey on mobile. It would be a big change, but the demo could be expanded to all targets,  for *non-commercial projects* only (encourage a splash screen). Or make the license not allow release on app stores. Yeah, I know that would be a big change, and can't be enforced. (Qt used to operate on 2 licences, commercial and non-commercial, basically on trust, no DRM).<br>Edit - iirc, GameMaker free version limits the number of *assets* - so, something similar is doable in monkey/trans. It would let people see monkey working on every platform.<br><br>Ted is still a *bit* lacking, although I like its simplicity and lightweight-ness. I think the lack of any context sensitive help and auto-complete is pretty awkward, esp if learning a new language.<br><br>Targeting those learning programming is always cool - they arent so 'invested' in c++ or whatever language and IDEs. <br>Also, I've seen frameworks that come with 'blueprints' for different game types, e.g. Match3, platformer, space invaders. Could sell/include stuff like that? Make it a community contest to donate them! The current examples are great, but perhaps a little disorganised for a total newbie.<br><br>Or, consider a Kickstarter/Patreon, but thats another story I suppose...<br><br>Another random idea - I notice that TexturePacker devs give out free licences to people who blog about their product. <br><br>I hope you are able to commit to supporting monkey v1, and we can continue to work with it for a long time to come. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I thank you for the work you've done for so many years, and I want you to be successful and happy, whether that's continuing with BRL or going to work for someone else.<br><br>My disclaimer: I've purchased almost everything BRL has done, but I haven't been very active in the community (or with a BRL product) since 2004-ish, BlitzPlus. I loved BlitzPlus. I thought I would love BlitzMax, but after many attempts, I was disappointed. I have mixed feelings about Monkey, but I am still interested. The last time I got my feet wet with it was with version 66. So, this is my perspective with limited interaction during the last 10 years.<br><br>I agree with what people have said about the name Monkey, and about marketing/PR in general. For example, I'm much more apt to come back to the monkey website when I see blog posts. But the only reason I know about Monkey is because of Blitz (with history on the Amiga). Most game devs don't know about it. I work in the game industry as my day job. I've mentioned Monkey to many people (devs, producers, designers) from various companies, but none of them has ever heard of Monkey. Not one. But when I show it to them and what it can do, they're impressed.<br><br>I also believe that the Blitz/Monkey market has been encroached upon by lots of competition. Unity is the gold standard right now, but UE4 is going to be very significant. On the less technical side, people can make legitimate games with engines like Gamemaker, and Construct. In my opinion, Blitz used to be more suited to the newbie developer. The language had a smaller scope. It was completely documented. There was usually only one straightforward way to do something. Blitzmax, and then Monkey, have become much more complex. The scope is undefined, because of modules, and the language itself supports multiple programming paradigms, so there is always many ways of doing the same thing. This makes it much more powerful, yes, but it also makes it much more esoteric, and less approachable for the hobbyist. Some modules work with others, some don't. Some are supported, some aren't. Some have higher quality than others. It's a trade-off. What it's done is try to move Monkey more into the professional (indie) dev space that is served by extremely well-established and entrenched giants like Unity, and doesn't speak to the hobbyist coder anymore.<br><br>That's not the only trade-off either. The constant updates are nice in one aspect, but they're a double-edged sword, because they often change functionality, and they come with gotchas of their own. Support capability is limited. And just by nature of having to support a single language over so many targets (I do appreciate the Windows Phone target!), there are lots of complexities. It's not easy generalizing a language against so many platforms and feature implementations! I don't think any single person could have done it better than Mark, but I think he'll be the first to agree that each target adds more difficulty.<br><br>One things that frustrated me for years was a well-supported way to parallel/concurrent operations, whether through co-routines, threads/fibers, asynchronous operations, or whatever. I don't know whether that exists in a well-supported manner for Monkey now, but Unity has it, and it sure is nice.<br><br>Mark, you said you're not good at marketing. That's OK--one man can't do everything. But it really needs to be done if you want the industry to take Monkey seriously. Of course, you can't hire somebody if you can't pay them, which leaves two choices to continue forward: rely on the goodwill of the community (which has gotten you this far and may get you a little further, but probably isn't the only long-term solution) or increase the revenue from what you already have. <br><br>I would be glad to pay for Monkey updates on a subscription basis. This seems more than fair. You have a while ago moved out of the hobbyist area closer to the professional area, which makes it more reasonable to charge money per year of updates. You may also introduce a royalty model, where you get a small percentage of anything made with Monkey. At the very least, if you haven't done it already (I'm not familiar with the free version of Monkey) you should make it display a "made with Monkey" logo for every game released with the low-end SKU. And charging on a per-platform/target basis wouldn't be bad either. In other words, you should get paid more than once for your ongoing and future work. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I don't keep up with things so much on the Monkey side, but it certainly goes for BlitzMax. I suppose there are various concerns such as losing control of the codebase, compatibility and the time needed to vet anything before it becomes official, concerns over maintaining code written by others etc, etc, etc- again it's a tall order for a one man band. I think there could have been some middle ground- bundle a few of Brucey's excellent modules, same with the community IDE (I talking Max again, but you get the idea).<br><br>Another problem is, a lot of us seem to have come to the Blitz language a long time ago, and every change of direction loses some of that community. Monkey's less desktop focussed, so that put a bunch of us off, myself included; although I did buy it and I like the language. BlitzMax I thought was a big language improvement, but even though a lot of the extra language features were optional it put a lot of the traditionalists off.

The fact that most of it is open source makes it sort of future-proof. My own experience "selling" Monkey to others has been that, when you explain them the source-to-source compiler, people usually think it won't work as well as it works, and they will end having to code mixing languages at some point, etc. then, If you make them use monkey for anything real, they come to (usually) love it. People is usually surpirsed how well it works and this is a bad symptom. I mean, if they're surprised, that means that it did not look as good as it is, and this can't be good.<br><br>Monkey will evolve and survive if this happens:<br><br>1.- Anyone talented gets the Open source part of it and leads an active Monkey branch. This has happened before to tones of open source projects that are still alive and doing well, after leadership of the project has changed from one developer to another.<br><br>2.- Mark gets an additional job, and that makes him more active. I've seen this before. When you have to work for someone else, it can sometimes be very stimulating. For me (and maybe just for me) when you have all the time you want to do something, you usually do it slower and, sometimes, you just don't finish work. With limited time and pressure, sometimes people can be more productive.<br><br>Kind suggestion to Mark: Have you considered making a kickstarter for Monkey 2 (or whatever it is called) and dual license it as GPL open source, and commercial closed source? This way,  it can spread for free, and be licensed for commercial closed source projects?<br><br>Now I'll take the chance to make what I think and hope can be a sort of positive announcement for some people here. We've been working on a port of our whole IDEs framework to Java and, while it will still get some months(being optimistic) to be finished, we'll be providing a powerful IDE for Mac Os and Linux. The idea is that this new IDE will be compatible with Jungle IDE in the project file format and will have a free version too that will include a pre-build Monkey X version (based on the Open Source Monkey).<br><br>EDIT: Now, if Monkey does not have a good word of mouth, we should listen what are the mentioned problems, and solve them if possible. A target installer for each platform could be hard to do, but maybe it is the most important thing to add? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

As soon as I did that things started becoming a lot more productive for me. Programmers in general have a tendency to lack leadership abilities (not all, but a vast majority from what I've seen, including me). They kind of just do whatever roles with whatever they were doing before. That's for the most part what Monkey has been doing as of late. I think the momentum was lost a over a year ago. I mean, the last item moved to the Bug Bin was over a year ago. That alone shows a sort-of problem with interest in even bothering to maintain appearance. I digressed a little though, still, what else can I say that I haven't said before in other posts. It's a lost cause to bicker over this.

I'm by no means a seasoned programmer like a lot of you are on here, but I'm more than familiar with the Blitz Products as I own all of them.<br><br>I believe that Monkey really needs a name change. Monkey doesn't mean anything and has no resemblance to any of the the Blitz products. Blitz is a well known name and it would make sense to continue with that way of naming new products.<br><br>The fact that it doesn't have a good desktop target is another reason why perhaps Monkey hasn't done as well as it should have done. Why do you think that so many people are still using BlitzMax and won't buy into the Monkey way of thinking? There is no DirectX support and I know from talking with others that this is a major thing for them not using Monkey for desktop games. Even though the Monkey language has a lot more to offer than BlitzMax, the simple thing is that it doesn't offer, as in features, what BlitzMax does offer.I know that iOS/Android is a big market, but look at most of the really good indie games, they are all mainly for the desktop either as DRM free or through Steam.<br><br>There are twitter and facebook pages for Blitz Research, but they are hardly ever updated, and there is next to no contact from Mark on the forums and that is not a good thing. People like to hear from the developers of a product and that doesn't seem to be the case here.<br><br>I believe that Monkey could be a lot more than it currently is, but there are some changes that are needed that most of you have already mentioned. I really hope that Mark reads these posts and see that the community is trying to help as we want Monkey (or whatever it will become) to succeed and be the best it can be. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I've tried to keep my responses limited to that, since that's all that's important to getting new customers.<br><br><b>The good:</b><br><i>-Monkey's name.</i>  Ignore the haters, this language needed a clean break from the words "Blitz" and BASIC to get any serious attention from new people.  I probably would've never given Monkey a second glance if it was called BlitzMax2, because BMax feels outdated, outmoded and obsolete.  So what if it can't be googled yet?  Tell that to Python or Squirrel.<br><br><i>-The price and pricing model.</i>  Again, nearly perfect.  No one offers a greater value proposition.  You could make "Pro Demo" versions that have gimped desktop/mobile targets that force a Monkey preloader (complete with URL) in there, easy marketing to other gamedevs.  Don't kill the value proposition with suggestions for pricing models similar to your competitors; you'll just lose one more thing that helps Monkey stand out.<br><br><i>-The language.</i>  Its syntax is the best thing since 1980s ROM BASIC in terms of ease-of-learning for its time, and it has almost everything a modern language should have in terms of features.  Easily better than Haxe's syntax IMHO, and it teaches good principles in a way that Python doesn't necessarily do (like strong typing).<br><br><br><b>The bad:</b><br><i>-The marketing</i>.  Monkey's marketed like the internet version of a mail-order catalog item.  Practically the only customers AFAIK are Blitzers.  "Word-of-mouth" isn't a magical pill, you basically have to make your own with seeds.  Most of these Blitzers have long since stopped being evangelizers and have become strictly businesspeople.  Their contribution is minimal and mostly limited to promoting their own business.  Paid promoters are a bit out of Monkey's price range, so somehow there needs to be a way to hype up the fanbase so that they promote for you.  In the meantime, it doesn't help by limiting the channels from which Monkey can be sold.  Steam isn't what it used to be now that they let everyone through the door, but it DOES give Monkey some fresh eyeballs, and there will certainly be people around to help write up a good sell page in exchange for a small one-time fee, or cut of the initial profits.  Do sales, give out coupons, or hold promos on popular gamedev sites.  Work with top developers to promote Monkey in their interviews.<br><br><i>-The communication.</i>  Mark, sometimes you are very well-connected to this community, seem responsive and read people's posts.  Other times, you seem aloof and in outer space on some other planet where no one can reach you.  I understand that not everyone can have an audience, but it goes a long way towards people seeing you as down-to-earth if you posted more public updates, or maintained a blog that did that on a regular basis.  I subscribed to your Twitter account just so I could get more info about what you're noodling, even if it's not Monkey-related.<br><br><i>-The lack of good support.</i>  You basically get what you paid for, here, but because Monkey isn't mature yet, it doesn't have a whole lot of top-tier modules that solve "every" problem common to most game developers.  The first party libraries solve most of the biggest problems, but the 3rd party frameworks aren't really established (and are either poorly-documented or require you to pay for them or their proper documentation).  Not a problem for veterans, but a problem for noobies for sure that ups the learning curve.<br><br><i>-The lack of a thriving ecosystem.</i>  It's every man for themselves here, pretty much, with a few scraps tossed here and there from time to time.  Collaboration is practically nonexistent (or is transient).  Attempts were made to resolve this with the Recent Apps section but it's not well-updated or particularly well-integrated.  A more automatic system, combined with an integrated point-of-sale system like the Unity Asset Store would help turn the ad-hoc forum system into an actual storefront that give noobs a better impression of the language's support.  Right now you have to lurk the forums to figure out what's "best for you" for everything.<br><br><i>-The IDE.</i>  It's a good attempt, but ultimately, the IDE is one thing that's been a big let-down of practically every Blitz language.  I'm spoiled; I grew up with VB/VS, one of the easiest-to-use IDEs around.  Only Jungle comes close on the Monkey side to this experience, and it's still a bit quirky.  Don't dunk too much more time into the IDE;  Instead, partner up with the major IDE providers to make package deals, and keep Ted around for the "No IDE" option.  Put Ted on GitHub as a separate project, and let other people make it better.<br><br><br><b>The ugly:</b><br><i>-The setup.</i>  Setting up the demo version's a breeze, but setting up the targets for the pro version turns off all but the most dedicated coders.  Not everyone's a "true-blue" programmer coming into MonkeyX.  They just wanna get up and go.  While it's not necessary to make an IDE that babies you (like Unity), at least having automated install scripts/modules with a front-end could go a way towards helping improve user perception.  "Getting Started" tutorials should be more accessible (read: Fun) and get people excited to wanna start programming with Monkey.  This might mean having a Banana which encapsulates a simple (but complete!) game, fully commented and documented.  Like Hartlef's book, but without the commitment to his framework.  Any "gotchas" in the way of this should be worked out at the core level, abstracted away from the new user.  (Like, say, inconsistent audio support.)<br><br><i>-The documentation.</i>  It's a mess, it's sparse, and Monkeydoc is incomplete.  Params should be implemented, and would be better served being updated and curated from a pool that comes from the community.  This would mean setting up a wiki-like system, making it CC0 (or similar), and pulling all the best stuff from the Wiki into the official docs in a semi-automated fashion.  Pushing back to the wiki should work similarly.  See MSDN for a good example of curated and good docs; just don't copy their labyrinthian organization.<br><br><i>-Bananas.</i>  Many included bananas are out of date, and only serve to give rudimentary understanding of the language.  Many are written by veteran Blitzers in the old style, barely-commented and full of unhelpful varnames and even type suffixes which make the language look unclean.  Some are buggy and shouldn't be used because newer versions exist that you'd only be able to find if you were looking for them on the forums.  The examples should be a shining example of the "Best of Monkey":  Simple, concise, clean and effective.  Some Bananas just need to be re-written to a more modern coding style, perhaps, but others need to go.<br><br><i>-Monkey's new logo and site design.</i>  It just doesn't look good to me.  Well, I should say, it could look -better-.  The original site design was indeed pretty outdated-looking, but the logo was great and a fresh break.  I don't know what the new site WANTS to be, with its rigid font choices juxtaposed with flat, but not-totally-unshaded vectors, but it comes off a bit weird.  Like someone tried to stuff a monkey in a suit, no pun intended.  The previous design had some outdated design choices, but the logo was playful, and the color scheme wasn't bad on the eyes. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I will gladly donate my time to improve it, but I need to be able to. If those of us who are skilled with marketing improve the landing page it alone will increase sales too. You gave a facelift to the site, but the landing page still is not as strong as it could be at increasing conversion rate from visitors. It needs to do much more than it's doing now. It needs focus on selling and nothing else. It needs to anticipate and resolve any concerns people have. Build up everything so when people visit the page they can know if Monkey is right for them, and have all of their concerns answered in one place so they can buy comfortably right then and there when they first visit. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Take unity or flash as examples; they never have "abandoned" products because they just keep releasing under the same title forevermore. If you looked at the architecture of either of these you would see they are essentially complete new products throughout their lifespans. So in reflection you could state that "flash 1 - abandoned, flash 2 - abandoned, flash 3..." <br><br>Maybe monkey could simply be renamed to "Blitz" and stick with that title forevermore. Even if there is a monkey2, monkeyX or monkeyPro don't bother with a complete re-branding. Your name is everything and to keep renaming your product dilutes the value of that brand.<br><br>If you create a sub-brand then it only has a limited shelf life before it becomes stale and you need to reinvent yourself. If you just keep your 1 core brand then you can just refresh it periodically with major releases. You would gain much more mindshare with a single brand and each time you major release, you have the ability to draw back old customers.<br><br>Look at coke, it tries and tries to re-invent its brand names over the years but only 2-3 have really stuck. Imagine the amount of time, money and effort that went in to get those names to stick. As a one man band Id imagine you don't have that kind of time, money and effort to get the monkey name to take hold...<br><br>Currently monkey releases often but with that you never get a sense of occasion. For us people that are already customers we get much excitement over frequent releases but to be honest we don't matter nearly as much as those oh so important new customers. Sure there is a thin-line where you need to make your core customers happy, but monkey shoots itself in the foot with tiny updates. If you limited releases to say every 3-6 months (apart from show stopping bug fixes), you could create a fanfare of NEW FEATURE ADDED, JUST ADDED IAP, CAMERA MODULE ADDED IN MASSIVE 2.0 UPDATE..... every time. With that you can attract new customers simply by promoting the major updates on development communities. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I think Monkey was/is close, but for the reasons outlined by everyone in this thread and Mark himself in his blog post, I don't know if it will make it over that hurdle. <br><br>I think it would be great if Mark could make Trans work with an industry standard language, so you could write in C# or JS, as well as Monkey, and then use Trans to publish out to target platforms. Then you are just selling developers a well-made tool for source code translation, instead of an entirely new language.

For example, a lot of people have nostalgia for the old names that may be coloring their judgment somewhat.<br><br>Edit: please excuse my poor proofreading, I'm using voice dictation on my phone right now.anyway, what blitz means to a lot of people is associated with toy languages, so starting with an unfamiliar name may actually be an asset rather than a liability. if the name itself starts off rather innocuous,they may be willing to give it a look simply because it is unfamiliar, and that's when we have our opportunity to show them our feature set. there are a combination of factors necessary to make this work, however I believe that marketing based on the old reputation is generally not a good idea considering how strongly some of you have expressed your (I'm sure well-intentioned) criticisms of BRL in the past. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Don't know if it's already too late, or if it will help.<br>I already said my opinion about the "IDE" (Editor) month ago. I am watching BRL products since I bought Blitz+ back in<br>round about 2000. Only few weeks later came Blitz3D, and I decided to not pay again. Instead I got PureBasic, wich<br>is still actively developed. It was Amiga and Windows back then, and is now Windows, Linux, Mac. 32bit and 64bit,<br>ASCII and Unicode modes. It is one good example where a product does not get abandoned, instead it is enhanced<br>and updated without an final "it is done" attitude.<br>Think about an up-to-date cross-platform Blitz3D with DirectX 11 and latest OpenGL support. It could still be the<br>top thing for indies to make desktop games. It is not, because it was just stopped, in favor of something different.<br>The new thing, BlitzMax, seems not to be that widespread, compared to Blitz3D back then. Again abandoned, in<br>favor of something entirely new. As we see, the new thing, Monkey X, is even lesser widespread. Some of the<br>problems (like the simple editor/IDE) are the same like 10 years ago. A good programmer like Mark Sibly should<br>be able to make something more advanced. He seems to have the skills, but the basic editor was an external<br>contract project and gets not enhanced anymore (small changes only if really necessary)?<br><br>I also wonder about simple things, like preferences files within the application directory instead user settings<br>directory. After installing new test versions, you can't just go, because a fresh install can't find the SDK's and<br>all the external stuff. Polishing such small things is also important in a professional product.<br>Add a dialog to the editor to set the SDK directories, and save this preferences to the user's home or app prefs directory,<br>so the next version can use the same preferences file. Saves the users some time with every new version.<br><br>I also recommend to put some syntax-highlighted code examples at the information page<br>at <a href="http://www.monkey-x.com/Monkey/language.php" target="_blank">http://www.monkey-x.com/Monkey/language.php</a>, to actually see what the language looks like, and to present<br>some of it's features visually. It says "Object-Oriented", "Classes", "Inheritance", "Generics", "Native code support", ...<br>Just give interested people in a hurry some quick examples in code, for all this features, to show<br>how easy it is to do and achieve something with Monkey X. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It isn't very well known. I don't think the name matters, as long as its not a swear word in Spanish or something. (There was a car called the Vauxhall Nova (GM in Europe), No-va is Spanish for doesn't go).  The IDE doesn't matter that much, it's never going to be Visual Studio, there is at least one good product out there and a lot of people are happy with TextMate or Sublime Text anyway.<br><br>The documentation is not that great. You can figure a lot of stuff out from examples. The Hartlef book is very good, even though I think it switches to FantomEngine maybe a little too early. But it is excellent, one of the best written tutorials I've come across.<br><br>Developers are concerned about product life though. This applies to everything - Corona, Gideros, Marmalade, Cocos-2D and all the other variants. I asked a while back 'What happens if Mark Sibley is run over by a bus' which some people thought was an odd question - it was a bit metaphorical perhaps but it is important. People have to eat and if there is insufficient income to support Mark, then his family comes first.  <br><br>Apple especially continually bollox around with stuff, and the build system requires tweaking. Will this continue ? This is the problem with some products - yes they are great, but is the support there ? No-one wants to write shedloads of code that they then have to dump because it is some system that vanishes overnight.<br><br>Moving onto github is a good start. Perhaps it should be spread further. If there are enough core developers interested, could we collaborate to reduce Mark's workload. A bit like the Linux kernel - Torvalds doesn't actually write much of it now (if any ?) and he has a job in his own right (i think ?) as well. But he coordinates and makes decisions.<br><br>I probably couldn't help with the build stuff for iOs or Android or HTML 5. But I'm a programmer and a teacher, I could write tutorials, code examples. Someone else, possibly Mark, could edit it. Other people could 'sell' it, work on something to lure people in. Perhaps the free version could be modified so it does allow people to generate for iOS/Android etc but the project size is limited.  Other people could work on the modules.  Could (for example) a deal be done with Mr Hartlef/Packt to include (say) the first chapters of the book as a tutorial pdf ? (this would hopefully generate sales of the complete book as a knock on ?) I wouldn't want any money for doing it, the survival and enhancement of the product would make it worthwhile. <br><br>I think it would be a terrible loss ; but I'm looking at using it for developing stuff, and Corona, and the blog post does make me wonder about it.

This means that I could make a game with OpenGL ES 2.0 for graphics, Bullet for physics, Lua for scripting, and have it all running on a web browser. Right now, you know that if you include a C++ library in your project, you are limited to the targets that use the C++ translator.<br><br>Another thing, a subscription model would make a lot of sense.

To help in our maintenance of the core engine and maintain a steady flow of add on modules we have recruited another developer to the team.Stuart Tresadern (TREZ on the forums) brings years of development experience to the team with core development skills in C, C++.C#, Mono and JavaScript and of course Monkey X.<br><br>More information about the details will follow soon!<br><br>In the meantime enjoy this little Ignition X + box2d + <a href="http://playniax.com/demos/box2d/MonkeyGame.html" target="_blank">R.U.B.E.</a> demo teaser! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Had the docs been better and the support been better, I'd have had a better experience. I am a very patient person and very perseverant. However, I cannot see many other newcomers trying out Monkey-X to be as patient as me before giving up and going elsewhere.<br>As previously mentioned, what BRL need is a dedicatd marketing person, web / forum person, a core developer and modules/targets developer.<br>IMHO, I think setting up a Kickstarter campaing with a clear plan on what the product will offer is the way to go.<br><br>In addition to a Kickstarter campaign, having a proper Forum system will help immensely. What's currently available is frankly terrible.<br>Finally, a Bounty system would be almost as good as a Kickstarter. Create a list of items people want, can be voted on, and put bounties against those. <br>Many people will want support for XYZ targets and others will want work done on specific modules. Either way, if there's money being put towards that, it's going to provide the incentive to get it done.<br><br>I am more than willing to pay for annual updates, will definately back a Kickstarter campaign and will definately put money into bounties for specific issues that many of us are currently having to deal with/work around.<br><br>Either way, the reason I went with Monkey was simply because it was the most affordable product that provided such a large range of platform compiling. Write-once-deploy-on-many-platforms is simply the best solution for someone like me that's not a veteran coder. I am not interested in learning 50 languages to get my product into many markets/platforms. Monkey allows me to do the impossible right now.<br><br>So thank you Mr Sibly. I hope you take all the great advice people have offered here and give it some thought. All you need to do is take a seat, think about what you want to do with BRL and the Monkey brand and get it done. Either way, I love Monkey-X and will continue using it for some time to come as frankly, for me, nothing else comes close.<br><br>To do my part, I will ensure Monkey-X is advertised in all the games I make. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It clearly works for other products, so why not. Even so, Monkey-X will still be more affordable to most.

This whole "Roadmap" thread is the result of multiple requests for BRL to actually provide information on the future of the product. He finally posts a roadmap, people are happy. Then people ask for small clarifications and updates but those just go ignored for months. The next thing he posts is the "this isn't working out" post with a link to his blog and then he buggers off again. The next thing relevant to Monkey (the undertaking to open-source it if he ceases sales) he posts on his blog and doesn't even bother to put a link here. I don't see anything unreasonable about the user community expecting more of a response.<br><br>Just to give another angle on the whole "make us pay more" thing. I'd consider paying more for more. I wouldn't consider paying more for more of the same. If BRL offered up a new Mojo with shader support with a price attached, I might be interested. If Mark pitched ideas for building the community and/or improving the product in ways that would make it more attractive and that had a price attached, I might be interested. If BRL simply drew a line under the current product and announced that future updates would be under a subscription model but everything else stays the same, I'd toddle off to Haxe and/or Unity. BRL's income is clearly an issue but simply throwing money at Monkey won't change why it isn't selling well enough now. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

A chimera between Monkey&amp;Bmax targeted only to PC target? Too late... Brucey is building is own 'translator' to compile bmx source to C++ (and therefore for any hardware). Oh, yes Mark could do it (or join forces with Brucey) and sell an upgrade for Bmax. Nothing bad at all.<br>Investing time in a new language (nowadays) is no more convenient...<br>So just choose what already exists and focus on this (or these).<br><br>Moreover Kickstart is not available in all countries...in Italy it can't be used.<br><br>In my opinion Mark should simply (!) <br>1 . determine what he want to sell in Monkey (a complete set of targets, just some of it+extra payment for target+extra payment for modules), as already posted by many users<br>2. find what are the most important (and required) enhancements for MonkeyX (it could be modules or targets... MojoOnSteroird, Monkey3d, MonkeyNet...) - I will focus on modules that have a 'decent' user base... no for exotic one (ie: MegaDrive target...)<br>3. fix the price for everything: annual fee for for update (if he want), new selling price for Monkey (or for target/module)<br>4. AND at the end start a marketing campaign OUTSIDE the BRL sites. Yes, in this case a 'donate' button could be used (as the 'donate' is to finance the campaign)<br><br>To be honest the actual business model is over. Look at this example (numbers are not real)<br>Actual user base (pay user): 1.000<br>After marketing campaign: +100 (in a year) <br>Income: 100*99 = $9.900 ... cut the costs of marketing<br><br>I dont think this income is enough.<br><br>scenario 2: with annual fee (ie: $ 10 for 'old' users, $ 20 per newest)<br>Actual user base (pay user): 1.000<br>After marketing campaign: +100 (in a year)<br>Income: <br>100 * 99 = 9.900 (the first buy you have the 'annual fee' included of course!)<br>1000 * 10 = 10.000 (annual fee - old users)<br>First year: 19.900 (- mktg costs)<br><br>Second year (in the worst case there are no new sells....)<br>1.000 * 10 = 10.000<br>  100 * 20 = 2.000<br>Total second year: 12.000<br><br>Second year (with new 100 users)<br>1.000 * 10 = 10.000 (annual fee for old users)<br>  100 * 20 = 2.000 (annual fee for new users)<br>  100 * 99 = 9.900 (new 2nd year users)<br>Total second year: 21.900<br><br>* Marketing is not ONE SHOT thing... it's something MUST keep on time. So Mark should change his mind on this. A 'lucky shot' on the re-launch of Monkey (thanks God, community or whatever...) doesn't guarantee the future (of Monkey or any other products).<br><br>I know this are numbers... but reality I think it's worst. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I do not agree with that. I for one love Monkey for that very reason. However, I think to improve things for everyone, perhaps Monkey should be sold with HTML5 and maybe Desktop as default, and then you pay for the targets you want. If you only want desktop targets, you don't have to buy anything else. If you want mobile platforms, you buy each one you want, ie iOS, Android etc. And if you want the more specialised ones (which may cost more due to less sales or somethign), like Ouya or PSM, then you can buy that too. <br>This way you only spend money on the platform targets you are interested in. And again, each target can have an annual fee to maintain, update, improve it, but since you're only paying an annual fee for a platform you purchased, the cost is less in that sense.<br>So, as an example:<br>Monkey-X yearly updates (standard Monkey, which is HTML5 and desktop): $59.99 p/y<br>Targets:<br>iOS, Android: $19.99 each p/y<br>OUYA, PSM: $29.99 p/y<br>etc.<br>On top of this, BRL can also charge for modules and their own updates, so if you're interested in using Box2D, it costs maybe $19.99 and $9.99 p/y for example.<br><br>My point is, by breaking down each target platform and module to individual products, you will be able to sell each one and their updates to those that are interested in only what they want.<br>Many people often complain about features they have to pay for that they never wanted or use. This solution makes many people happy. BRL can also use these sales breakdowns to see what is popular and what needs improving to MAKE them popular, NOT to discard due to lack of interest. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I think it seriously dictates what kind of games you can make, and that's not where I want to go. I want to use input devices like the keyboard or joypad.  If Mark has mobile (phones and tablets particularly) as his focus then he has lost me as a customer. Well, I will go back to BlitzMax, basically. :)<br><br>I should not have bought Monkey, I realized after some time playing with it. Mark has always released 'ready to go' packages, and Monkey is not that, but I expected it to become one over some period of time. I was expecting it to get the Blitzmax functionality (at least) because it is a BlitzMax successor!! Now, it does not seem that Monkey will turn in to what I want.  Note that this is not the fault of Monkey, but of me, I should not have bought it.<br>I am glad I got to support Mark though. He's made my coding life fun again by offering complete packages, ready to go, no fuss. I do not want to interface with native code etc. I'm glad he has abandoned the principle of 'if one target does not support 'x' then no target will get feature 'x' '<br><br>I think Monkey has too many targets. It needs more focus so it can do the fewer targets REALLY well, to make the clutches and native code interfacing go away.

Game development is a hobby for me like many others here, and I won't invest but so much money into a hobby when I can simply just find a different hobby. I need food and clothes. I don't want to wait until my retirement that may never happen to pursue game development, not worth it. There are also stable, free, open source engines that have a lot more to them than Monkey has right now. <br><br>B) Mark would piss off his customers...<br>Especially all existing users who've already been promised this wouldn't happen, and with lifetime updates garenteed. It would also effect potential buyers. One of the greatest things about Monkey right now is how cheap it is. If it were pricy, no one would buy it in it's current state. <br><br>C) Monkey is worth its current price but no more than that...<br>Monkey needs to head for the direction all other game engines are going - i.e. native GUI editor, realtime particle editor, realtime 3D editor, builtin box2D physics, realtime shader editor, or, what about at the very least just a simple yet flexible level / menu, tile, and entity editor? Monkey has none of these things and every other engine I've tried before, whether free or paid has at least three of these things. If Monkey-X kept up with the times then yeah I could she the price change. If Mark hired more developers that would help too.<br><br>2) Less target platforms? Why?<br><br>I'm especially shocked you think Linux, Win8, and Windows Phone shouldn't be supported. To drop support for a target because you have no choice, like in PSM's case, I understand, but to remove official targets just for the heck of it will probably upset some customers too. The more platforms supported - the better; the less - the less customers. Sure, dropping platforms can give Mark more time to work on other things, but would that ultimately help Monkey and its users? What about the people who bought monkey with a specific target in mind to develop for, and Mark spontaneously dropped support for it? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It is a little like Java, there are consequences of multi-targeting, and if you want pure desktop it is not the best option (though quite a nice language).  It is a matter of horses for courses.<br><br>With regard to monetisation, I said a long time ago that Monkey should have been $180 and stayed there.

It's a lot of old people who are mostly toxic and don't contribute to the "new thing" anymore, the way I see it.  They want the control, and it's still expressed even now with demands to change fundamental direction on the project and bring it more in line with either 1. Something more like what existed in the BMax/BB days, or 2. Something they see from competing packages -- as if either of these things would actually bring in a new market.

I haven't looked into it yet, but if there's a way to prove to the affiliate that a particular user resulted in a sale to BRL, I'd probably try to incentivize affiliate sales as well (perhaps including one of my unreleased libraries, frameworks or whatever originally written for commercial titles with any copy of MonkeyX purchased through the affiliate link).  Since I'm very much in favor of the current pricing model, I'm more than willing to do this myself to spread the language's adoption.  Moreso if MojoX ever comes to fruition and is still backwards-compatible with the existing Monkey language -- Mojo libs can be given away, MojoX libs can be affiliate-sponsored gimmes to paying customers.  More people should probably try to spread adoption of the language this way. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

A dedicated desktop solution will be better for desktop dev. A dedicated mobile solution will be better for mobile dev. And so on.<br><br>The other characteristic of Monkey is that it is lightweight for rapid prototyping. This is a huge benefit for certain types of workflow.. It is many times faster to stage up something in Monkey rather than Unity for 2d work. (For 3d, of course, Unity destroys Monkey).<br><br>The other crossplatform solutions out there -- and I looked at all of them! -- have various tradeoffs. Believe it or not, Monkey is actually the broadest x-platform support on the market. That is a unique offering. Reducing platforms means that the product enters competition with narrowly targeted solutions. For example, if I were doing mobile-only dev, I would choose Corona. It's Lua, so I already know it; it's got more active support; it's got a larger community.

But generally speaking, the same solution can be applied to both problems:  Allow rich metadata within modules themselves (or as headers/stubs/whatever included with a module) that allows for easy automated documentation and update-checking.<br><br>Some other things the docs could really handle better are preprocessor directives and code samples, but maybe those should be kept out of the docs system, and simply leave open templates for this so the generated docs can be dumped on some wiki core (with the examples and other things filling out the template blanks, again auto-magically based on the latest/greatest community source) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I haven't seen any advertisements for Monkey - didn't even see them for Blitzmax, even tho it was more than worthy of advertising.

They have real debugging, a visual dialog editor, a resource, code, and class management tree, but monkey has none of this. With that same kind of mindset you could also argue that monkey isn't a programming language because it uses syntax highlighting, because like you said, it's programming language, not an interface, and syntax highlighting is considered a form of interface. <br><br>This topic is about the future of what monkey could be, not stating what it already is and giving up there. It's about improvement to make the product better, not to make things more complicated than what they need to be. The minority of general game developers actually like the coding process being bare bones, the majority strongly prefers what can get the job done the quickest and easiest ways possible involving code only when it's actually needed.<br><br>The point of a cross platform language is to require less re-writes and code in general. So if you really like coding so much I don't know why you chose monkey when you could write your game manually with 6 different languages. I don't care  if this community doesn't agree with me as it's a single grain of sand compared to how many potential customers monkey could have if it wasn't a syntax highlighted notepad.<br><br>It's good to use c++ for power. It's good to use GM/Unity for rapid development, but monkey is in the middle ending up with not having the benefits of higher or lower level languages. Meaning it doesn't have the power and benefit of spending more time to learn and actively use C++ and also doesn't have the speed wow-factor GM/Unity has for example.<br><br>If monkey was meant to be powerful like C++ then it shouldn't exist because that's what c++ is there for to begin with. If monkey had more interface, it would attract those customers who want rapid development. I don't see anything but benefit from that, but the best part is it would all be optional just like it is in GM/Unity.  Want less interface - no one would force you to use it with code also present. You could use code and/or interface like most game dev software leave the option for. don't care if monkey is a programming language, that doesn't mean it can't be a better one if given the chance. <br><br>This would make passionate coders and rapid developoers both happy.

I'm using Sublime as editor (I download and modified this <a href="https://github.com/gingerbeardman/monkey.sublime" target="_blank">Monkey Sublime package</a>) and I setup a custom build system using Perl, targeting the Trans compiler, and everything is working wonders.<br><br>Long story short: this piece of software is amazing, I found it by googling "multiple targets programming language" or something similar, and there's not much else similar out there. Just with the HTML5 target my prototypes are playable from every device out there! There are many many things which absolutely have to be addressed, but I believe we can plan and work on something together as a community (better docs? better bananas?). I will probably start a blog about the development of my current game with Monkey.<br><br>The product is there and it's real. People need to hear about it. Now if Mark isn't able to continue the development of new features, we as a community can continue to extend the language with modules, and try to address some issues ourselves.

The same as it always was when I was coding business apps. When visual form design came out in the likes of VB and Delphi it made application development much faster. I started in the days of clipper and DOS when you had to write out stuff by hand @5, 4 SAY to show a label or @5,4 GET to display an input field. I moved to FoxPro soon after as it came with a visual screen designer, a visual report builder, a visual table designer etc. etc.<br><br>Thats why you see things like Cocos2D evolving, there was cocosbuilder and now there is SpriteBuilder, create your levels and physics bodies visually and away you go, massive time savers and its all about time these days as we all have precious little of it free. <br><br>I'm not 'dissing' Monkey as its awesome but there is obviously a barrier to entry which has stifled its adoption.

It was Blitzmax before. I shout everywhere about Monkey but I hope I will do better.<br>Like Gerry, I did some games with MSCV, and find Monkey more powerful as the same code generates a conventionnal c++ AND other platforms native source code (and project). I did a few commercial game conversions too, and I think the benefits of Monkey philosophy here is unbeatable.<br>I agree that the standard IDE is not very powerful (I use Jungle), but for serious needs you can use dedicated dev tools for every platform, it's not a matter for a professional use.<br>Monkey is a great language with a great feature: code translation, not a GameMaker. I don't think that the future of Monkey is toward beginners. Hobbists are usually more professional than beginners. If you don't understand well the difference between a code source translator for multiple dev kit platforms and a script language interpreted by a multi platform engine, Monkey is not for you. Efforts from Ziggy and SubZero are great to help installing dev kits, I would have loved to have them when I installed android dev kits for the first time... But then, if you want to release a product on stores, the difficulties are far beyond Monkey.<br>Also I'm not saying that Monkey, cannot be a good learning tool, beeing able to run HTML5 without anything else (dev kits) is very fine for that.<br>Unless you need advanced 3D, Monkey can be an efficient language and can bring a good methodology for production to an average size game studio. Mastering all your code may seems more difficult at start, but when you are about to release a product you will not fight against a black box (ask Unity devs...)<br><br>My last game propotype is all done with Monkey, the PC demo was sent to publishers last week. The new company I'm creating (Gloomywood) for this project is investigating Monkey for the real production. Targets are PC (probably Steam but not only), Consoles and Mobiles. Yes it means porting mojo to PS4, XBox One, PS3,... , but it's easier than porting a c++ game. <br>The game has a lot of 3D raycasted voxel sprites in a 2D environnement, this would not have been possible with an interpretor like GameMaker or Unity (or really more difficult). Rendering and lighting are all software yet, but we'll add Shaders management dedicated to our needs, something that we anyway need to do whatever the production language/tool. <br>I hope a lot that mojoX is about shaders... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I've made my very first reddit post on there thanks to that thread.<br><br>I must say that the comparisons to haxe are not surprising.  However, I wonder if there's a way to really hype the syntax in a way that won't draw out the phony BASIC deriders from out of the woodwork.  BASIC's pretty much a "dead" syntax and yet for many people, it was one of the most approachable and their reason for being coders today.  The closest thing most people trying to get fresh blood into the game compare it to these days is Python -- I'm guessing because of the dynamic typing and wealth of built-in libraries.  That being said, the syntax was the main reason I chose Monkey over Haxe -- with a close second being that Haxe's trans-compilation was only able to target Flex or something like that the last time I'd checked it, and that was rather weak.  According to the Wiki article, C++ support is still considered "experimental" even!<br><br>It may make sense to point out some of those as strengths Monkey has over Haxe.  One of which I should add is temporary, as its quickly becoming the de-facto translanguage compiler, making Monkey look less appealing as a general-purpose language with each new platform Haxe supports.  To get more community support behind monkey, we need to leverage the strengths we have while we still have 'em and build on it as a community.  I'd say in the last month we're getting to be on the right track, with easier install processes, major improvements to 3rd-party IDEs and the like. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
