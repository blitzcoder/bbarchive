(even though I chimed up earlier)<br><br>If an installation program was created, I think it should be left simple, and basically just unzip the files into a location set by the user. Keep in mind that this would need to be modified for each OS. Mac gets one, Windows gets one (hence why I believe its just a straight zip format to begin with to keep things simple).<br><br>As far as an in-app update feature, sure that would be nice too. I don't disagree with it, but it will take time away from Mark in having to maintain generating what it needs to update. That will take time away from Mark in getting future updates out as quickly as he has.<br><br>Honestly, I don't see Mark really wanting to spend time with this process when everyone is fairly familiar with unzipping the files into a location of their choice. Yes, I agree that it is very tedious to have to manually maintain the "extras" we each put into the monky file structure.<br><br>I have my own batch process that maintains this stuff for me. It keeps it fairly simple and all I need to tweek are a couple things at most. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You pointed the question at Mark, so I referred to him in the same manner you did. All I meant is that HIS team may not have the time to deal with that undertaking. <br><br>It really doesn't matter whom on the team wrote the editor. The point is what Mark has his members doing might not align with getting the features you requested. If an installer comes about, I am fine with that just as long as all it does is extract the files to a location I requested without making any changes to a registry or the like so I may continue to use it on any computer I like.<br><br>As far as the in-app updater, well that would be nice too.

Ask where to install monkey<br><br>2.1 If a new location, unpack files, copy them over<br>2.2 Ask the user to point to each of the install locations for each taregst SDK's this would then populate the config file and save.<br><br>3.1 If an old location overwrite all old files with the exception of config files.<br>3.2 open and parse config files, make any updates but leave the users own additions in place, ala remote modules folder, diff install paths for the sdks.<br><br>I can totally understand people wanting to keep the app mobile, I am with you 100% on that, my intention was never at any time to lock down , write to registry and limit its flexibility, which a lot of assumed is what I was on about, that's partly my fault for not being clearer in the OP, its one of my faults.<br><br>In terms of an Update option in TED, it would carry out the same sort of functions the installer would, it would grab the new version from the online source, it would unpack it, and it would then update/replace the required files.<br><br>Neither option would stop you using a USB pen, Neither option would be hard to do on either platform , all an installer is, all an updater is , is a method to automate something we all do, and something we do frequently with monkey, when I see something, a task being done a lot I cant help but think of ways to automate it, its the programmer in me I guess.<br><br>SO!..<br><br>If you guys, talking to those above at the moment, have problems with the more specific functionality that I have laid out above I would honestly love to hear it, as I said before I'm open to changing my opinion if a good enough reason is presented. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
