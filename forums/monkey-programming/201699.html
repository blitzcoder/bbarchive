It could be as simple as Diablo or as complex as Minecraft/Terraria or even From Dust if you really went all-in. While I personally think the answers in the league of From Dust is more interesting, at this point I'm not yet quite ready to throw away otherwise perfectly good ideas for how to get "something like that" into something made with monkey.<br><br>Since, as Skn3 pointed out, there is no reliable cross platform way to get "render-to-texture" or a pixmap concept going, so the two other alternatives so far (that I've come up with) are:<br>1) Create an enormous amount of pre-generated images, and combine them creatively. This technically works, but is painfully slow (and prohibitively memory consuming) in HTML5.<br>2) Create a Java servlet (or similar) to serve you the procedurally generated images. This doesn't actually, currently work, but could be fairly trivially kludged in there, if you really wanted to.<br><br>Neither of these are pretty, but both could be coerced into working (particularly if you didn't care about HTML5). So the question is initially more of a technical nature rather than a theoretical one. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That's one of its major USPs.<br><br>It's no problem then if we download additional modules that have extra features but don't work on all platforms.  When we use such modules we know what we're getting into.<br><br>By the way, I'm not much of an expert regarding building and stuff, but my belief is that Monkey needs a preprocessor because nobody knows what shape it will be ultimately, and a preprocessor adds the flexibility needed at the lowest level. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
