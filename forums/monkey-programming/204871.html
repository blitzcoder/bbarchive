It has a few extras but it isn't as easy to use as a wordprocessor. It parses the source code and with the help of some kind of markup tags, it creates html files from it. You can add anything via html code. But what you want to archive is better doable in a cms tool or something like you want to use. You want to be able to document it like in a wordprocessor. My tool doesn't help you here.<br><br>Btw. what made you choose a domain name like this for a monkey related theme? And who chooses and decides who these "well respected" mods are? What is their qualification? You are closing a door on some contributers right there. That gives a bad taste. I would also list things in alphabetical order to prevent that people think you favor one thing or the other. Imho you also need to create style and formating rules/guides so contributers know HOW they have to add things. A consistant style is mandatory for a site like this. And people would need to monitor Monkey closely to discover any changes in it and change docs on this side accordingly.<br><br>Anyway, good luck with your project.

If the author of something wants to make their docs publicly editable, they can host them on github or similar (if they're not already) and changes can be merged with blitz-research/monkey at the same time as the actual module code. This is, I think, how 99% of real-world projects out there probably work? It also allows 3rd party authors who don't have stuff in the BRL repos the ability to create their own, private docs.<br><br>There's also the question of accuracy and consistency. If a web-based docs system does happen, I would definitely like to see some kind of 'editor approval' feature in there to prevent against wrong/misleading/unreadable stuff being posted. I don't want to be constantly monitoring recent edits - I want to be leisurely selecting future ones!<br><br>All that said, if someone comes up with something that works and gets widely accepted/adopted, I'd be happy to host it here, as long as SiH agrees (since he'd be the one dealing with the web stuff and he only has so much time to devote to the site). I'd be reluctant to host anything until it was at least as comprehensive as the current docs though, as I don't  want to host something half-done that ends up getting abandoned. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This eliminates all sorts of problems like wild edits, versioning etc, and you get the docs for *exactly* the modules you have installed. Docs are quick and easy to edit, with no faffing around with dodgy custom online 'richedits' or waiting for the modem to reboot (hey, it's NZ!). Yes, to modify docs you have to fork the github repos, but overall it just seems like there's less hassle or potential for drama doing it the 'makedocs' way again. <br><br>As for the 'look' of the Monkey docs, if anyone feels they can do better please take a look at the src/george/page_template.html file and have a play. It's based on the python wiki system I played around with a while back, and is highly configurable. The only thing it really enforces is the 'page per scope' format (which I MUCH prefer to 'page per decl' - easier to get around and makes it absolutely clear where everything lives) but that could be changed if everyone prefers 'page per decl' or 'page per arbitrary category' or something else.<br><br>Personally, I don't think george is far off being useful. I'd like to add the ability to trawl modules for .monkeydoc files (and .monkey files themselves for 'in source' docs), clean up the simple markdown' system it uses (you can always resort to in-doc html anyway) and build a better set of wrapper (ie: non-module/decl) docs. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Github would allow for community contributions this way.<br><br>&gt; * Because it is monkey I think the docs should support both OOP-Based &amp; Function-Based API's<br><br>Yes.<br><br>&gt; * The API should be in control of the one who programmed it<br><br>Yes, an API author should somehow have some sort of editorial control over the API docs.<br><br>&gt; * The API should be close to code, or it might get "out of sync"<br><br>Yes.<br><br>&gt; * The API needs little to no contribution from a community, except for spotting actual errors<br><br>Well...not sure all Monkey users would agree.<br><br>&gt; Creating a great Doc-Generation system would be enough, no doubt. I'm just saying we already have a great system working. <br><br>I have no idea what you mean here.<br><br>Yes, creating a great doc-generation system would be enough! But I was unaware we already had a great system working...that's not the feedback I'm getting!<br><br>Or are you saying you've already solved all these issues?<br><br>&gt; And they can both work together - API section updates from offline generated docs while Guides &amp; Indexes section lives online and is converted to offline. <br><br>I *sort of* agree.<br><br>For module/framework guides, I'd still prefer to work on them locally in my editor of choice, and have them 'attached' to the code to eliminate versioning/editing issues. But then perhaps that technically makes them API docs, so not what you're talking about.<br><br>For more general 3rd party tutorial style stuff, it doesn't matter as much. Such stuff could theoretically live in a 'docs/misc' dir in the monkey repos and be built with the API docs, keeping everything source based and in sync etc. But perhaps it would encourage more people to write such guides if there was a simpler online interface than Github?<br><br>To sum up, if I'm reading you correctly you're talking about source based docs for API/decls, and web based docs for tutorials/guides - correct? Wont merging the 2 (esp. links) be a reasonably complex problem? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

An official #DocsStart #DocsEnd comment tag would be a wish.<br><br>Guides, tutorials, samples or having code snippets next to the API is what I find lacking, and I'm not sure that it is solved by improving the API docs, but I think it can be solved *forever* in this great community by making the step to contribution lower. Framework &amp; module creators are prime contributes, so I wanted to give something of great value back to them - a doc-system they can use and a place to be seen/searched.<br><br>I think API docs are a remnant from ancient times before the invention of intellisense &amp; modern IDEs. <br><br>Take my spec-library as a "real" example.

Guides/tutorials are great for getting started, but once you're up and running it's the API docs you spend most of your time in.<br><br>For example: <a href="http://doc.qt.digia.com/4.6/qmainwindow.html" target="_blank">http://doc.qt.digia.com/4.6/qmainwindow.html</a><br><br>(Make sure to click on the 'More...' link near top for detailed description - is this what you mean by 'Guide'?).<br><br>Not the prettiest (the offline version looks better), but this page has pretty much everything you'll ever need to know about QMainWindow in it. It also has incredibly convenient 'jumping off' points in it via the 'type links' (ie: every class/type on the page in the decl docs link to it's own docs - current monkey docs do too) that mean I never really have to leave the API docs.<br><br>This is most certainly not a tutorial (or guide, by my definition anyway) - it's the hardcore nitty gritty stuff that you *need* to know once you're 'off the ground' with Qt, and is the sort of stuff that IMO needs to be written/maintained by the Qt devs as it's vital it's accurate and up to date. It's this kind of detail (and examples apparently, despite all those bananas!) that I think Monkey lacks.<br><br>I guess (maybe?) what you're effectively talking about is moving the 'detailed description' sections from the API docs to a separate page on a website. And yes, that has some definite advantages in terms of allowing the community to make contributions as opposed to Githubm although it does split up the docs considerably and introduce versioning/moderating issues. But as long as it's *only* the 'detailed descriptions' I have to worry about dealing with online (and not the decls), I'm less opposed to the idea.<br><br>Perhaps we just have different definitions of API docs...! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I have made my own tool for this based on this idea. Every time I expand the framework I can update the docs by just running some scripts made in BlitzMax. The only thing it does not support is the F1 key but its not a big problem for now. IMO a tool like that is enough and could come from either Mark or 3rd party and then stick by it. I know Mark changed his mind about the BlitzMax doc system but I think it worked really well. For me the community does not do such a bad job helping other people with examples and all but for the less experienced programmers the official docs can be a little bit limited. I am not sure this can be solved by better docs but more tutorials about programming techniques and I dont think that would be Marks job. The Playniax framework comes with a lot of examples and in source remarks but I noticed that people are really happy with the tutorials. I am going to continue this on this path but I think Mark is saying that this is not the same as API docs and I agree if that is the case. But the bottom line I think is content and a tool to easily maintain it, not where or who is hosting it and online or offline. I have put the docs of Ignition online just for people who are interested in buying it but I prefer the docs to be offline because of running demos from the IDE/TED. Just my 2 cents :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Restores the state of this mainwindow's toolbars and dockwidgets. The version number is compared with that stored in state. If they do not match, the mainwindow's state is left unchanged, and this function returns false; otherwise, the state is restored, and this function returns true.

To restore geometry saved using QSettings, you can use code like this:

 void MainWindow::readSettings()

     restoreState(settings.value("myWidget/windowState").toByteArray());
