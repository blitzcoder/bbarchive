The 'Millisecs' command has nothing to do with OnUpdate, OnRender, or anything like that. The only thing the 'App' class has to do with it is the offset when starting (To my knowledge).<br><br>Just for the sake of target safety, I don't rely on 'Millisecs' for anything but timers.<br><br>And as I stated on the other thread, no updating should be done in 'OnRender'. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

"application has been running" does not sound like "including when application is inactive."<br><br>Plus, why do the milliseconds keep rising if the game is inactive? Does that make sense to you? What reason do they need to keep going up? It just seems like extra unnecessary work for us that should have been handled.

You're also acting as if I wasn't reinforcing that ideal to ensure that others within this thread were on the same page.<br><br>At this point, this whole thing doesn't even sound like a bug; but it does sound like an inconsistency between some targets. You should expect 'OnRender' to be called at any time, and not rely on it for any unrelated updating. And as a response to what you said about 'Millisecs', it's not supposed to be based on 'OnUpdate' to begin with. It's simply stating how much time has passed since the program started, nothing more. If your timer code (Assuming it's setup like: "Millisecs()-Timer &gt;= Timeout") should used under the impression that this waits X milliseconds of time, not some arbitrary number based on the activity of the application and/or what the system has done to update your application.<br><br>If the PS Vita target works like that, then that target is the one falling out of line. Unless of course Mark thinks having an inaccurate 'Millisecs' command is a good idea. If that's the case, I'd not only be disappointed, but that could also break some people's code (Possibly even my own). Most notably, that kind of functionality could completely break some people's delta-timing code. And if the PS Vita target causes this, then I might not even consider it for future projects (Or I'd hack my own command in). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
