I hope you're not going to repeat what Mark did. <br></div><br>My idea is to provide a website where you can sign up for free and you can register your own modules. When you register a module, you'll have to provide the checkout command used to clone the module locally (git or hg will be required). You'll be able to also register dependencies of other modules. That's the first part of the plan.<br><br>Then, after this is done, I'll do an open source assets application (not sure if I'll do it on Java or directly in Monkey). My idea is that this application will integrate a browser where you can navigate through all modules in the site and install any of them with a single click. This application will check for the availability of the required version control systems on start, and allow an automated install of any missing ones. Also, this application should allow for detection of new versions and should give the option to update any installed module that has been updated in its associated repository. <br><br>That's how I'm designing it, but if you have any sensible suggestion to improve this idea, feel free to make it. This is not exactly the way Mark was doing it, but close to it in the sense that most module developers are already using git or mercurial, so allowing them to distribute easily their modules by just registering them on a site, it's a nice plus for the mod developers and users. Also, the site will allow for distribution of commercial modules given they use authenticated git or mercurial repositories. Also, this site will allow the integration of donate buttons on free open source module pages.<br><br>On a second "round" I would like to integrate too artist packages in the whole system, and promote the site on artists sites, so they can expose their work and we (coders) and them (artists) can get mutual benefits of this system, if it gets adopted by a sufficient users base. <br><br>This app will be bundled with Jungle Ide, but will be redistributable under a MIT license, so it could be easily integrated in TED or any other Monkey IDE. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If Ziggy requires a release to specify a revision/tag/branch/whatever for a release then that problem goes away. It still leaves the general problem of requiring devs to use particular version control mechanisms and for users to install those tools though. It also breaks Nobuyuki's "no extra work" desire but I think that's a non-starter anyway. The best you can do is minimise release overhead, not remove it.<br><br>To be honest I don't get what the issue is with creating zips. If you're creating a module for release then you need to have it sitting in your module directory in the release state in order to test it (you are testing it, right?). Zipping it and uploading it wherever from there is a minute or two of effort at worst. That said don't see why this is an either/or problem. If a module package is a zip or other archive format with some sort of release and dependency specification then you can create it from files or from a repo tag/whatever if your repo is suitably organised.<br><br>Ziggy seems to be shying away from creating a packager and I can understand that from an effort perspective but I think it's a necessary evil. Providing a tool eases the path to adoption and also provides a mechanism for maintaining release quality/consistency. As I've mentioned previously I had been considering building something to help address the module discovery/archival issues along with other problems like documentation (I even bought a domain). I'd be happy to help out with this as long as it's genuinely open for the community and separate from BRL and LemonBytes. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

My impression is that pretty much everything is actually WIP.<br> <br></div><br><br>Unless those "customers" are paying me money, I'm not bending over backwards for 'em.  They're fellow developers and if they want a commercial experience from my framework or modules they can pay me for it.  Otherwise, if they don't want updates like that then they probably shouldn't download my modules!  I make every effort not to break things between updates, but I do what I have to do, because I make the modules for my own projects first and foremost.<br><br>I would say that as long as we can specify a checkout branch then it doesn't matter, because people who -do- care about that can keep separate dev and release branches.  I'm not super-concerned with people who break their own projects with an automatic module update, but putting update burdens on the module devs is a step backwards.  We want to increase adoption of modules, but in order to do that, first you have to get module developers on board if you want any hope of a chance for a self-sustaining ecosystem.  That means reducing the barriers to entry for module devs to near-nil -- you can't force everyone to play ball on your new playground.  <br><br>Personally I think it would be best if Ziggy had an option to "copy over" any installed module directly to a project to prevent this problem:  i.e., some sort of context menu can bake a current version of an installed module to the project folder.  Barring that, however, version locks in the auto-updater would be fine too.  Just something to remember which modules <i>not</i> to update automatically unless you do so from the manager, and something to show current versions installed and latest available from the same manager.<br><br>Whether to have a package manager vs. a list of modules from their own repos I think depends on the intended purpose of the feature.  If it's to add value to existing Jungle customers by making updating modules more convenient for them, and this alone, then it doesn't matter how annoying it is for module developers provided it's "better" than the current situation,.  However I believe this feature is meant to spur more widespread community adoption of modules and for that the barrier is getting the modules to the people who want them first.  Worrying about them breaking their own projects is putting the cart before the horse -- can't happen if there's no modules that even use the system, or any devs that care to keep their modules up to date on it.  No software ghettoes please. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There's nothing easier for them in this, not any easier than using git or whatever else they use today.<br><br>Rather, it lowers barriers for module *users*. I think that if Monkey's ecosystem grows, it'll almost certainly follow the same pattern as most any other community: a few will contribute heavily, and far more will make use of what those contributors provide. Most of the usability issues that have been the subject of discussion here in the wake of Mark's blog post have been about lowering barriers to entry and increasing usability, and this fits in that same pattern. This feature will not serve those goals if it acts a means of distributing broken code.<br><br>The single biggest value this new centralized distribution channel lies in the fact that it is in fact centralized and (hopefully) easily visible. Once it's up and running, someone should go through the snippets of code posted on these forums and turn as many of them as makes sense into modules!

I'll be doing both, but I'll start with the git / hg system frist. You'll be able to switch from one to another in the repository site, so it shouldn't be a major issue. In fact, I think that it's better to provide ZIP when the development is very active, so all changes too much too often, but when the module matures and it's mostly on a bug-solving status, switching the distribution to git or mercurial will make it easier to release early and often quick fixes. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
