When the enemy is destroyed but a bullet assigned to it wasn't responsible, it should be assigned a new enemy.  There are a few ways this can be achieved, but here's one:<br><br>1.  Create a circular reference between bullets and their assigned enemies.  A field in the enemy should contain a reference list of bullets assigned to it, and bullets should have a reference to its currently assigned enemy.<br><br>2.  When an enemy is destroyed, go through its reference list and tell the bullet which destroyed it to be destroyed itself.  Remove the reference in that list.  For each other bullet in the reference list, assign it a new enemy target.<br><br>If assignment to a new target requires iterating through all enemies or bullets or needs to comb through all the objects multiple times for some reason, then you should probably re-think your data structures a bit. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Well,.. the app is on GooglePlay and I sell now also a pro version. I sell so many, that I only need 15.000 more months like the last one to become millionaire....<br><br>the problems on 4.xx were caused by a different handling of orientation changes. Mark found out, what the reason was and changed something in the V70 now. So now nobody should have those problems again.<br><br>A second source of problems is the different way of loading resources on 4.xx. My resume on this: Everybody should now switch to async loading to prevent problems.<br><br>A third handicap of the app is the disability of displaying texts sharp and fast and stylish like other text. I tried to start a discussion here about the need of a html-text displayer, but had no resonance. Seems that I am the only one, who offers manuals and long texts to the users.<br><br>So I keep on fighting every day... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
