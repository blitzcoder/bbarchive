x=x+speed
y=y+speed
</pre><br>This is always running...the only thing i am doing to tell the objects to not move is to reset the speed to 0.<br>So what i do is:<br>if object next position=solid then speed =0<br>The problem with this is if i stop using the step by step movement and i opt for a fluid one, every collision get messed up because the "solid prediction" code works using steps.<br>I would like to change it and use a rectangle to rectangle collision, the problem with this is that i don't quite understand what to do when they overlap!<br>If i naively do:<br>if b overlap c then b speed=0<br>The object b will never be able to get out of the overlap zone...<br>What i want to implement is:<br>if overlap speed=0<br>check where object was coming from and set it's coords to the previous one before the overlap<br>check for input, if input will put you in overlap again don't move<br>if input will take object out of overlap then move<br><br>Is there a better way to handle this? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In such a playground you can also do a smooth pixel movement, but you should use the "reservated" flag for fields, which are target of a "occupation process" by a figure during the next 31 pixel steps.<br><br>If you want to have fine positioning you should give up the 32er grid and allow fine movement of all actors.<br><br>In my game "Guitar vs Football"...<br><br><a href="http://www.midimaster.de/download/GitarreVsFussball.exe" target="_blank">http://www.midimaster.de/download/GitarreVsFussball.exe</a><br><br>... I did something similar: It looks like a grid, but I allowed fine pixel positions and controlled the "collisions" by simply calculating the distance of two objects. <br><br>diffX=PosAx-PosBx<br>diffY=PosAy-PosBy<br>If (diffX²+diffY²)&lt;(HalfSizeA+HalfSizeB)²<br><br>HalfSize was the rounded half pixel size of the figure.

That way another object trying to move onto the same square won't be allowed, as it is told that the square is occupied.  (Unless it is a monster that is able to eat the first - Pacman monsters can move onto Pacman.)<br><br>You might be more flexible about allowing objects to move onto the square you are leaving, to encourage fluid movement.
