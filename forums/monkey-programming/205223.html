Maybe even some semi-random values.  These get set when the alien is constructed with the constant value.  Then you set any other needed things like position.<br><br>As for movement, if as is often the case there is only one player position, and it is the only thing that influences any alien's movement aside from things like its current position and movement, you might have a method like:<br>Alien.Move( timePassed, xPlayer, yPlayer )<br>..called during update.<br><br>It would be fine to have ways for the alien to know these parameters without them being passed too, though.<br><br>Hope that is some help in making things tidy. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Move the actor (or alien). An alien can be assigned a particular movement class and then will act in whatever way the movement dictates. For example:<br><pre class=code>
Class Actor Abstract
    Field x:float
    Field y:float
    Field movement:ActorMovement

    Method OnUpdate(delta:Float)
        If movement movement.ApplyTo(self,delta)

Interface ActorMovement
    Method ApplyTo(actor:Actor,delta:float)
End

Class MoveUp implements ActorMovement
    Method ApplyTo(actor:Actor,delta:float)
        actor.y -= 1
    End
End

Class Alien extends Actor
End

Function Main()
    Local alien := new Alien

So you won't run out of memory if you keep creating new objects (so long as you keep forgetting about them!).  It can lead to some loss of efficiency, though, because the operating system has to find the chunks of memory that are no longer referenced, and mark them available for re-use.<br><br>Whether this matters depends on a lot of things.  I don't really like the idea of creating a new AI object on every update for every ship, but if the object itself is small it might work fine.  If it were me I would probably have a persistent AI that changes state occasionally.<br><br>If you have a limited palette of movement patterns, what you are doing is fine, so long as each 'movement' stores no information from the particular ship.  If a movement depended on the ship that is moving, you obviously could not do it this way.<br><br>At the end of the day, you seem to know what you are doing, so don't worry too much about the 'right' way to do it.  There are lots of right ways - what matters is whether you can understand / extend what's going on, i.e. whether it works for you.  The way you choose to do this kind of stuff is largely a matter of personal coding style - especially in a flexible language like Monkey, which caters for a lot of styles. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

On desktop it doesn't matter so much but on mobile it definitely does. The beauty of passing in the actor/alien into the ApplyTo method... Or whatever you call it, means you could essentially just keep 1 global copy of the movement object. Multiple actors could have their movement set to the same movement, very efficient! If you want something more complex such as MoveTo(x,y) to move an actor to a given point on screen, you'd need to create one per actor.<br><br>In my code I have a ActorMovement class which handles updating the actor in a particular way. It also handles creating ActorMovementInstance, which is used to store the runtime values for one version of the movement. This means I can create a MoveTo global object, let's say I want coins collected to move to one place on the screen. I would create a MoveTo object and set the x,y. This is now a blueprint I can create instances of. A coin is collected, a MoveToInstance is created, the MoveToInstance is used to update the actor coin and move it to the predetermined location on screen. When it reaches the location, I delete the instance but keep the MoveTo blueprint ready for the next coin. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
