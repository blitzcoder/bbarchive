Other than that, all the file references are relative to the project file, so it should play nice with any good source version control system.<br>I'm using it on several projects such as Jungle Gui: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/junglegui/" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/p/junglegui/</a>  and Harpl: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/harpl-project/" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/p/harpl-project/</a><br><br>It can be that SVN can't do a proper merge. It's a very outdated and limited version control system. I would recommend you to use Mercurial instead, it's a lot better in everything, specially on merging changes.

I don't see why this should be a problem, if the files have the same content but different save date, they should merge automatically without any conflict<br><br>That said, if you happen to have a jiproj file that does contain absolute references to files, other than the "OriginalDiskLocation" parameter, let me know it, as it could be a very rare bug<br><br>EDIT: Ok, I've managed to leave this argument out of the JiProj xml-based document, so it may be a bit easier for SVN to merge JiProj documents on next Jungle Ide version. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I splitted all non mercurial-friendly settings of a project to the JIPO files. Those files should be excluded but JiProj files can be included on the repository so you get build options and files included/excluded form the solution when working with a team that uses Jungle Ide. Obviously leaving this files out would only require you to manually add/remove or re-reference files to the local project when they're created, deleted or moved, but that's something you should not be manually doing when using Mercurial IMHO. Just my 2 cents. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In this compatibility area all documents are always closed with caret at first char and at first line. This is done this way just in case someone tries to open this document on a very old version of Jungle Ide, but as I said, this information is arbitrary, always the same and, and ignored by Jungle Ide. It merges automatically always without any difference.
