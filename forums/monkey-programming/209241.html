Field counter:Int = 0

Method Whatever()

   Local otherVar:Int = 0

</pre><br><br>In v77f, this wasn't breaking.  But obviously it should have, and in v81b, it threw the error on Local, so I thought I couldn't use Local anymore, but I didn't even notice the End if instead of a Next.  Making the End If = Next instead of course worked.<br><br>However, I still can't do this without an error anymore, so I have to go through and remove it all from my code:<br><br><pre class=code>

Method Whatever()

   Local i:Int = 0

   For i = 0 to 10
      counter = counter + 1
   Next i

End Method

</pre><br><br>IT says there is an error on the "Next i" line, and removing the "i" makes it work.<br><br>I do wish I could still have the "Next i", but changing it to the following ultimately serves the exact same purpose:<br><br><pre class=code>

Method Whatever()

   Local i:Int = 0

Because Monkey wasn't supposed to allow what you were talking about, nor does it actually make any sense.</b><br><br>First of all, your loops generally should be encapsulated in their own functions, or at least manageable enough to be put into small-ish functions. A function that's too long will be more susceptible to L1 cache misses (Though, modern compilers handle loops very well). In the case of larger loops, this can be an issue.<br><br>But never mind the hardware specific stuff, what do you mean by "Keep track of nested conditions"? Do you mean keep the variables around between/after loops/cycles? If so, you should just define these things first (Outside of the loop). And if you want a variable to be local to the loop, then you use 'Local' inside of it.<br><br>The variable 'I' in the case of "For Local I:= 0 To 10" is a bit different. In that example, 'I' will usually (Or at least conceptually) be popped off the stack when the loop finishes; this means it won't be accessible anymore. Defining 'I' before the loop, then writing "For I = 0 To 10" will then result in the use of our local variable 'I', which we would need to define before the 'For' loop in order to use it (Otherwise an error would occur on compile-time).<br><br>So, what did QBasic do? Did it effectively allow multiple (Or at least one) variable from the context of the loop to be returned? That's a bit convoluted, but an interesting idea. Or was this a matter of knowing what loop you're ending (Similar to the optional "End INSERTNAMEHERE", for example 'For' loops have 'End For' as an option from what I remember. To this same effect, there's also shorthand for some of these, like 'Endif')?<br><br>If that's the case, you shouldn't need this "Next i" thing. A well structured program would usually keep track of this via functions and methods (And their return values / manipulation of objects).<br><br>I can only assume you were getting at the idea of knowing when a variable's scope ends. This is done for you if you use nested local variables. And if you don't want 'i'/'I' to be a local variable after your loop, just use the "For Local" technique (This will pop that variable off the stack when done). Doing this will allow you to reuse the name 'i' (Or 'I' if you chose that) without having to worry about anything. Technically, you could still redefine what 'i'/'I' is (The "For Local" setup lets you technically do this), but that's not the point here.<br><br><b>Here's a (Good enough) example of Monkey's 'For' loop functionality, as well as some documentation on how loops work in Monkey:</b><br><textarea class=codebox name="code" wrap=OFF readonly="true" rows="15" cols="80">
Strict

Public

' Functions:
Function Main:Int()
	' Local variable(s):
	Local X:Int
	
	' Here's a 'For' loop using a pre-allocated local variable.
	For X = 10 To 20
		' Nothing's needed here.
	Next
	
	' Now, we'll output to the console about the 'X' variable's condition.
	' Due to the nature of 'For' loops, this will be the number of cycles + 1 (Since the above example uses 20, this will be 21).
	Print("X should be 21: " + X)
	
	' Here's a 'For' loop using in-line allocation.
	' The ":=" here is for automatic type resolution; useful for situations
	' where you just want the language's largest or most fitting integer type. (If unsure, don't use this often; Monkey only has one integer type at the moment)
	For Local I:= 0 To 10
		Print("I: " + I)
	Next
	
	' From this point on, we can't use 'I' for anything.
	' If we use "For Local", 'I' will be terminated after the loop ends.
	
	' Uncomment this line to see the error caused from using an undefined/non-existent variable.
	' If the above 'For' loop was like the loop we had for 'X', we'd be able to access 'I'.
	'Print("We're unable to do this without causing an error: " + I)
	
	#Rem
		Also take note of the other types of loops:
			* The different styles of 'For' loops ('Until' and 'Step' are useful).
			* 'While' loops: Useful for checking at the beginning of a cycle if the loop should continue.
			* 'Repeat' loops: These can be either infinitely long (Using 'Forever'), or as long as you define (Using 'Until').
			
			'Repeat' loops and 'While' loops are actually pretty similar, but they can have different purposes.
		
		From there, we have three keywords that will help our loops be faster and more versatile:
			* 'Continue': When using this keyword, the current cycle of the
			loop will be ended, and the next cycle will automatically be started.
			
			* Exit: This keyword will exit the current loop's scope.
			This won't be graceful. The remaining code will not be executed.
			You will simply be booted out of the loop, and any loop-local variables will be popped-off/terminated.
			
			* Return: This is an old favorite. Though, it may seem wrong to
			return inside of a loop, it's actually perfectly acceptable practice.
			
			Returning is effectively the fastest way to exit a loop,
			and any parent loop(s) (If they're local to the current function/method).
			
			There's no difference between returning inside of a loop. Just keep in mind that nothing else
			will be executed when you do this. So unlike the others, you won't be booted out of the loop.
			For 'Return', you'll be booted out of the function/method.
			
		Other notes:
			* 'Exit' will only affect the current loop.
			If you use 'Exit' in a loop that's inside of another,
			it won't exit out of the outer loop, just the current (Inner) loop.
			
			Common practice with 'Exit' using multiple loops, is to perform one of the following actions:
				* Move the inner loop into its own function/method.
				* Use local variables for exiting the parent loop,
				then simply set that variable in the sub/inner loop before exiting.
			
			* If 'Continue' is used when a loop is supposed to end already
			(In the case of 'For', and from what I remember 'While' loops),
			you will step over the rest of the loop. (Again, I'm pretty sure 'Repeat' is different about this)
	#End
	
	' For the sake of my sanity, I'm not going to show you ever single setup, but I hope you get the idea.
	
	' Return the default response.

</textarea><br><br><i>As a side-note</i>: With most C-like languages, the 'Exit' keyword is commonly called <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/37zc9d2w.aspx" target="_blank">'break'</a>.
