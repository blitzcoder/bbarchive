Class Map&lt;K,V&gt;
   Method Compare( lhs:K,rhs:K )
      Return lhs.Compare( rhs )
   End 
End
</pre><br><br>I know some users will think this is a bit 'loose', but I think it's a simpler/cleaner solution than going down the complex constraints road, which will never really be as flexible anyway. Either way, it'll fail at compile time if K is not 'comparable'.<br><br>The reason this isn't used in the current Map is that it falls over when K is a non-object type like Int/Float - but so would a Comparable&lt;T&gt; key. <br><br>So generic interfaces aren't IMO that useful when used with generic classes, which leaves...? The holder/bag example above is interesting, but is it that useful? If bag is a concrete, non-generic class, what is the point of holder having a generic interface? And please excuse my relative ignorance of how Java et-al do this stuff - I'm more used to C++ which is definitely looser but also somewhat more straightforward.<br><br>The C++ STL also stresses separating comparison function from object much more which I like - having Compare 'inside' the object strikes me as inflexible as it means you're limited to one comparison function per class. The current mechanism of having to extend Map with a comparison function is a pain, but it does at least mean you can have multiple comparison functions per class. With C#/Java's Comparable&lt;T&gt; setup, this seems much harder to do in a flexible way as you have start using different mechanisms. But perhaps it's not that big a deal.<br><br>Anyway, this is still up in the air...any contributions welcome! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Most of the geometry code and many fields of the rectangular objects will then become obsolete; only the method names will remain the same.<br><br>It occurred to me that it would be most elegant to make the rectangles implement an interface defining these methods.  Then classes that use them could switch easily to the more general shapes that implement the same interface.<br><br>Now the code for (say) IsTouching(other) should refer to an object of the same kind.<br><br>Of course this can be coded in all sorts of ways.  One is to have the complex shapes extend the rectangles, but then the objects will have unused fields.  One is to have rectangles and complex shapes both inherit from a base class (this is interfaces by the back door).  One is to use interfaces anyway and deal with or ignore the non-genericity (for this project I can ignore it anyway as the rectangles probably won't ever exist in the same game with the more complex shapes).<br><br>And there is cut/copy/paste into a new project, which in truth would probably be the fastest!  I just thought I might use an interface for the fun of it ;-)<br><br>Anyway as you can see the lack of generic interfaces isn't something that's ever likely to bother me particularly!
