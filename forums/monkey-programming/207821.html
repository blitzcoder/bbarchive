I think Monkey's IDE needs DND like GameMaker and Stencyl have or least something more than a notepad clone with syntax highlighting. That's why people use Notepad++ if they want auto syntax checks and highlighting.  With DND it can provide much more rapid and friendly development to new, inexperienced users, advanced, and experts alike. Just a thought. It doesn't need  to be DND, there just needs to be something more than just a notepad because the IDE in it's current state to me shouldn't even be called an IDE it's way too bare bones. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Maybe you've just not been in the Monkey forums long enough judging by your user ID.

Back then when Jungle wasn't as good and there weren't other options, this was more of a problem and I might have sided with you. Since then, though, Jungle has jumped leaps and bounds above the competition and tons of other free (including my Notepad++ UML), and some paid, solutions have emerged. So the need for Monkey's text editor to be more 'professional' is no longer a real issue. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I don't know if Monkey has gained enough notoriety to be shelved into the children's toy category, yet. Then there's Unity which is now considered a AAA grade game engine and development suite. I don't really see how these things are easily comparable to themselves or Monkey. If all they have in common is that they can make games, then we can stick about 10,000 other things in there as well.<br><br>People will choose whatever makes them feel most comfortable. I for instance have used Unity and think it's fantastic. It was very easy to get stuff up and running and the new 2D stuff is well done. However, I also think that it's overwhelming when I want to do certain things. Then there's GameMaker, I looked at it for a bit and said, no, it's not for me. It felt very amateurish. Monkey meets me in another place when I want all of the control with no major drawbacks. None of this was decided upon because of the text editor.<br><br>I think what will really sell Monkey is a large library of code. However, Monkey does not have that at this time and could be more than reason enough that people look elsewhere. For instance I've had to develop my own hash map, linked hash map (ordered map), vectors, matrix, and numerous other common functionalities because Monkey doesn't come with them by default. Like I said in my other statements, there's a little too much focus on the text editor from the community when in reality languages like (repeating myself here) Python, PHP, and Ruby, for example, all do well because they have gigantic libraries of code. Less work for people equates to more productivity. Programmers have a strange way about them to defy any pre-existing libraries if they don't "come" with the language. So, yeah...hmm, I have nothing more to say on this topic. I've written all of my racing thoughts. I need to get back to the Candy Jam. I'm getting a bit too distracted from the forums here. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The programming IDE.<br>2. The high-level game-creator IDE.<br><br>At the moment Monkey seems to be generating a steady stream of simple programmer IDEs that add Monkey specific support over a generic text-editor with syntax highlighting. Jungle is by far the most advanced but still doesn't have code navigation abilities like find all references, basic refactoring like rename or implement interface or the (relatively simple to implement) ability to run commands before and after a build. I only mention this because the fact that they all stall out on features after adding target drop downs and taking a stab at auto-complete points towards a lack of interest/market that will support such an effort. <br><br>As far as I'm aware the attitude towards TED (and Monk before) is just to have a basic app to avoid users having to use the command-line to build. You click the exe, tap out "hello world" and build to a target inside of a couple of minutes. The thing is that pulling together something like TED is doable for one person in short order with modern UI toolkits that essentially have text/code editor drop-in components. Going beyond that as a programmer IDE requires significant work with language parsing and trying to bend the previously helpful UI framework to your desires. It starts to look like a full-time job for more than one person.<br><br>The situation gets worse for a game-creation IDE. Now you don't just need an IDE that can handle text. It now needs to handle images, tilemaps, physics objects, state machines etc. On top of that you need to construct an entire game framework that the IDE can sit on top of. There's way more work in doing that than in creating Monkey and Mojo in the first place. Monkey could very well be used as a base for a GameMaker competitor but you'd need a team to do it. I may be wrong but Mark doesn't seem interested in working in that sort of set-up. Maybe the community could step in and start something and next time someone talks about creating another code editor their energy could be redirected. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Therefore, I go to its website recently. I discover that the new version Cocos2D V3 has SpriteBuilder 1.0. Actually, SpriteBuilder is is a professional GUI editor. It should not be the same as GameMaker Studio. However, this kind of editor may help many users a lot.<br> Anyone tries this editor? Is this editor very useful? Does Monkey X needs such editor? Can this kind of editor help Monkey X users a lot? <br><br><a href="http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/build-a-physics-game-in-9-minutes-with-spritebuilder/" target="_blank">http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/build-a-physics-game-in-9-minutes-with-spritebuilder/</a><br><a href="http://www.spritebuilder.com/about/" target="_blank">http://www.spritebuilder.com/about/</a><br><img src="http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/ce/20/95/ce209589-30fd-ff00-4d7c-6c450d34bdb6/screen1280x800.jpeg"> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Saves a bit of time with physics boilerplate code, if thats what you need. It does provide a nice visual starting point for newcomers, thats true. GameMaker seems to do much more, though I've not tried it so I dont know how the workflow is. These apps start off quite simple, and develop over a long time - they are a big job.<br><br>But, as muddy_shoes said above, there is no standard game framework to build upon, and it cant really build on mojo alone (no standard sprite, font, label, button, resources, callbacks etc), unless it is just a trivial layout tool. I'd kind of like mojo to have those extra things, because I think new users do expect them, but it would soon become bloated, and harder to maintain or port to new devices. Well, I assume thats why mojo is kept so lightweight.<br><br>I quite enjoy the simplicity of Ted, though I'd like to have code completion and better help integration, and perhaps a built-in webkit view(?). I'd be to happy work on some features myself if I knew it was worthwhile effort (I've used Qt professionally for 10+ years, all main platforms).  I had no issues building Ted on Mac via Qt Creator, just made one change for Qt5. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

IE if Jungle IDE was actually shipped with the official monkey distro and not a seperate payment that'd be probably the easiest and quickest option. From what I take it, Jungle was made by someone who isn't a part of Blitz Research Ltd so if that's the case why not collaborate and share profits? Another idea, look at Visual Studio or Code:Blocks instead of editing the configs and sdks directly in the text file in notepad what about a menu item opening a GUI window where you can press the three dotted browse button and select the SDK path from a open file/directory dialog?<br><br>Also YYG actually have a lot of people working on their product, probably ten times as many game engine devs in YYG than BRL. Sandy Duncan, Mike Dailly, James Foreman, I can't remember the rest but somewhere on their site I actually saw their list of GMS devs and it was a relatively long list.<br><br>Edit: also I feel like a complete dick because of what I posted here the other day I have no excuse.
