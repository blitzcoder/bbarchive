Appending strings to another string of large size is slow, that is the base of the problem:<br><br>I should not have said "Dies" - It just slows down to an impossible level. It never actually crashes. After the 393k, adding a character to the end of a string takes much much longer, meaning appending a row of 1x256x16bytes takes around 250ms on my machine. The more I append, the slower it gets.<br><br>This is on GLFW.<br><br>I am just wondering what the best way to save levels of this size is? <br><br>Since posting I've had an idea to turn my data string into an array. this way if there are 10x 393k string arrays, I only have to append 10 large strings before writing and no single string reaches the point of being slow to process.<br><br>About the 300k char array: I am able to access a string by using variable[10], but I was hoping I could define one of a certain size, then say variable[10]=256 (or variable[10]="a") however they are write only, so it is not possible to use them the way I require.

Don't know if Monkey permits pre-allocating large strings and filling them from an ascii array or something to avoid recreating the whole string in memory but that's how I would do it in Java.  Maybe worth checking the Monkey docs deeper or someone else might want to chime in; I saw something about a StringStack class which contains a Join() method that returns a concatenated string by combining the whole stack - this would be up to the implementation of Monkey to handle correctly on different platforms but I haven't looked at the internals to know what's behind the scenes.<br><pre class=code>
' right from the Monkey Docs - it is unknown to me however,
' if Monkey uses optimized implementation for all/any targets.
Local vec:=New StringStack
vec.AddLast "Hello"
vec.AddLast "there"
vec.AddLast "this"
vec.AddLast "is"
vec.AddLast "a"
vec.AddLast "StringStack"
Print vec.Join( " " )
</pre><br>Reducing the length of strings can also help with performance especially in the large strings that store level data.  I usually encode the data to shrink filesizes and this works really well for 2D tile maps in particular.  2D maps can be unfolded into one dimensional representations to omit storing x/y coordinates and also any repeating tiles can be encoded with simple tags to further increase capacity.  The idea is to only store what is needed avoiding empty space and redundant data.  As an example my data file might look somethins like this:<br><pre class=code>
name = Level 1
size = 10 x 10
' tile coords are represented by 1D array index that will automatically fill the 2D volume
' the line below encodes that 20 tiles 'x' should be inserted starting index 0
' and 10 tiles 'x' starting index 90.  For a level thats 10x10 in size this means 
' first two rows and one last row will contain tiles 'x'
x,0:20,90:10
' if no repetitive sequence is present simply store only the index
' the line below would fill the third row of the level with tiles 'y' every 'other' tile
' and fill the fourth row completely with 'y' tiles
y,20,22,24,26,28,30:10
</pre><br>I hope that makes sense to whomever might not be familiar - it's a very simplistic compression for repetitive data and transformation to one dimensional view - saves me a ton of memory and space for storing tile maps, probably won't work/help in all cases but worth a thought for improvement.  There must be many little things that can save a bit of space - like storing entity position and orientation can probably be encoded or unrolled - maybe using 'angle' to store direction instead of a 2D vector.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Dmitriy <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
