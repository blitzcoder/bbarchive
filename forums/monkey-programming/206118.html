It can interface easily with native code, but cleaving to the native UI is not what Monkey/mojo is fundamentally about.  <iframe src="http://apps.monkey-x.com/is a language, mojo is a library of cross-platform functions./1/html5/MonkeyGame.php?width=640&amp;height=480" width="640" height="480" style="display:block;"></iframe><br><br>What's the difference between a utility and a game, exactly?  Perhaps, in a game, the user accepts the interface that's given as part of the game.<br><br>Monkey does not, for example, have any direct support for native menus on the various targets.  You can easily *make* menus with Monkey, but they will either target every native target separately, or they will be sui generis menus that will look the same on every Monkey target, but not necessarily the same as any other menu in the world. <br><br>Looking at the site for Xamarin briefly, I suspect there is no simple answer.  I suspect it accesses native-looking GUIs more easily, but you will have to rewrite your utility's interface for every target.  With Monkey you could easily get your utility operating quickly and looking the same on every target, but at the cost of your GUI not looking so native. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Mono, Xamarin allows you to code using the VS.NET Frameworks. You CAN use the same GUI for ALL platforms using GNOME's GTK, but under the Windows platform, you may also choose to use Winforms instead.<br><br>Having coded on both sides with GTK and Winforms, I must say that Winforms are FAR easier to implement and wrap your head around, but once you get the hang of GTK, its about the same between the two; just the learning curve is there for GTK.<br><br>Code-wise, having the power of the .NET frameworks is pretty nice. Xamarin has implemented most of the latest .NET Framework into it and is constantly enhancing its capabilities.<br><br>Monkey is designed to work natively on all targets, and really, Xamarin does this relatively the same - both use GCC. It really depends on your capabilities with each language and what you are trying to do in your app for which toolset you decide to go with. You may find that Monkey fits your needs if you need a lot of graphic capabilities. The .NET Framework offers GDI+ (under Windows) which is VERY slow compared to Monkey's OpenGL implementation. Right out of the box, Xamarin doesn't offer anything for graphics other than the basics for drawing forms and controls. You can find .NET libraries that offer OpenGL or the like to in<br><br>Honestly, I'd use Monkey for game development and higher end graphical tools, and leave Xamarin for the rest.<br><br>Also, Xamarin has a pretty hefty price for iOS and Android development per year. If you can overcome that, Xamarin really has a nice IDE you can develop with. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's also not slow per-se; Cordova doesn't know anything about controls ; you normally use HTML and when you use HTML you need to optimize for that. Meaning it won't look/act/feel native because it's HTML , not native controls and some libraries (notably the horrible crap Jquery-mobile is) use way too much DOM magic to be fast. If you have a state of the art phone then it's ok. But this has nothing at all to do with Cordova. We made many solid working apps with Cordova writing and optimizing html/css/js by hand for webview. <br><br>Xamarin is nice and you write , like others said, the frontend in the frontend model belonging to the specific platform. You can also use Corona (WP-8 version is on its way) to write once, use everywhere and Corona does use native components. Monkey will probably have a library like Corona in the end; GUI libs which are not native and a native libraries which abstracts the same API over all platforms. The former is something I currently use in my Monkey projects, the latter is something i'm migrating to. <br><br>There is no reason why you can't use Monkey for that (like Corona); the only thing which is hard for new users to get their brains around is the problem that you cannot really mix the game and non game aspects when using native controls. You can z-index your native controls and, in game, you can z-index your game 'layers', however you cannot mix them; your game objects are on top or under all the native controls and vice versa. That's why Xamarin's option is easier; you just hack all your stuff in the interface via the platform API and not an abstraction. <br><br>After having written apps with Monkey, Corona, Cordova, Native, Codename One and Appcelerator, I must now say that if I have have to write cross platform, I would take an abstraction. The time spent hacking in those native API's is way too much work unless you have a ton of money and time to burn on something. And it's not that much better. My next app will actually be written in Monkey with native components; I'll open source the lib of course. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
