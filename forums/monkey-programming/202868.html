I understand that I need to be more precise and provide a working (or not working) example so you can recreate it at your end, and then delve into why it doesn't work... especially since it does at your side.<br><br>Ok, this isn't much, but I've taken your code and gone back to the Monkey ide and pasted it in and made some changes. I haven't used the Monkey ide for months since I now use Jungle, so it's possible (read probable) that I've just done something very dumb here and this is nothing. However, I've saved the code and made the data folder and dragged my original Fontmachine font folder into the data folder. So now it's using the same font and data structure as my Jungle version.<br><br>What I am noticing is, if I run it in HTML5, it does work, and my font shows correctly. In Flash it gives a null object error. If I comment out the call to 'Drawstring', it then works. So what I'm thinking is, the call to Drawstring is somehow behaving differently between HTML5 and Flash, and somehow just passing 'greenmedium' in Flash isn't passing the font correctly.<br><br>I should point out I know nothing of other languages, I barely understand my own programs xD<br><br>Here's the code, similar to yours but a bit updated...

If you mean that you get the problem with the null check removed then either your font data is broken or you've not included a character in your fontmachine font that is in the text. If the character doesn't exist then GetFaceInfo returns null. In debug mode I get:<br><br>Monkey runtime error: Null object access<br>C:/Data/Dev/Projects/monkey/temp/Untitled_47.monkey&lt;58&gt;<br>C:/Data/Dev/Projects/monkey/temp/Untitled_47.monkey&lt;29&gt;<br>C:/Data/Dev/Projects/monkey/temp/Untitled_47.monkey&lt;14&gt;<br>C:/Data/Dev/MonkeyPro/modules/mojo/app.monkey&lt;70&gt; <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But if you leave the top reference to the font and just remove the B:Bitmapcharmetrics line (and the lines with 'B' in just after), then it all works fine. Meaning it does still reference the font above and infact it prints the text in the correct font (albeit all printing over the top of each other because the routine doesn't work now).<br><br>I actually thought the font was broken or something because I was getting other font errors but then I realised it's because I'd named your program 'test' and put it in the same location as my game but hadn't made a 'test.data' folder... for some reason I was assuming it would access my game's data folder but obviously it needs it's own. So now it works fine, in both targets.<br><br>I was replying to your previous reply here, your point about missing characters may have hit the nail on the head, but it's odd because I included every letter of the alphabet and all numbers... I'll check that. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

So presumably the sentence 'a' would give an 'a' and then some kind of end-of-line character, and since my font doesn't have that character, that's the null object.<br><br>Thanks very much for your help, it's fixed (fingers-crossed) and I've learnt a few things.
