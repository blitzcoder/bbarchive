I started him with Blitz 3D.  I started by explaining screen coordinates and resolution.  Also how RGB is used to define color.  He said let's draw a rainbow.  I had him use a piece of paper and figure out the coordinates on the screen and then define a different color for each rect.  He surprised me with how quickly he grasped all of the concepts.  I wasn't sure what to expect at his age. He is in the gifted program and is very quick with math, so that probaby helps.  <br><br>I am trying to decide where to go next.  I have also been considering the small time outlaws tutorials as well.  I just went back and watched some of them again and they are really good.  I think I may go that route and fill in any gaps.<br><br>When I was about 12 or 13 in the early 80's, I designed a tie fighter sprite and moved it around the screen and bounced it off of the edges on my C64.  I can still remember the feeling of satisfaction 30 years later and showing my parents what I did.  <br><br>My parents always fostered my interest and I now make a lot of money in the IT world.  I haven't pushed any of my kids into what I want them to do, but I definitely want to encourage them in the  things that they want to do.<br><br>I would be interested to hear ages and if there are other parents that have successfully taught their kids.  This is a great thread and I would love to have more discussion. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
