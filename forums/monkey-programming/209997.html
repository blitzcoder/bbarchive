If you want a reference/pointer to 'score', what's the point? Can't you just use the variable? If you want it to be "dynamic", and grab the state of the variable from somewhere else, you could use a reference to the object, then get its field. This basically applies to global variables too. If you want a "variable" somewhere that makes the way you access the variable abstract, then you need a property. Other than that, I don't understand what you're asking. Just pass your objects around.<br><br>Example of what I was talking about:<br><textarea class=codebox name="code" wrap=OFF readonly="true" rows="15" cols="80">
' Not exactly the best thing to do, but you could add 'Selects' in these:
Method Score:Int() Property
	Return Player.score
End

Method Score:Void(Value:Int) Property
	Player.score = Value
	
	Return
End
</textarea><br><br>Really, if you're going to have a 'Player' class anyway, you might as well do it <i>right</i>, and make 'score' a field. Well regardless, the best you have is "accessors", the nicest of which are properties.<br><br>Building a proper 'Player' system where you use fields and objects instead of global variables is ideal, though. Objects are passed by reference automatically. Most notably, most of the C++ targets just use pointers anyway. Meaning it's the same as C in this regard. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

In OOP you realize this via the Publish-Subscribe pattern (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publishâ€“subscribe_pattern).<br><br>Basically, an object subscribes to the topics (or events, if you prefer) of a publisher object, so that when the publisher publishes new topics, all the subscribers to that particular topic get notified. Then, the subscriber may ask the publisher for the properties which should have changed, or the publisher may send the changed properties along with the event notification. This depends on how you decide to implement this model. I generally prefer the latter, because of the tell/don't ask principle, and to have less manual work to do.<br><br>Of course to be able to do this, you should setup your objects so that their attributes are set through methods or properties, not by assigning directly to their fields, otherwise they wouldn't know when some of their properties changed. This in fact could be a good place to start using properties for your objects.<br><br>It's really handy and versatile, I use it in various places in my engine and games. I suggest you to make the required code abstract enough that you can use it in any part of your projects. Here's the interface code that I'm using:<br><br>Publisher<br><pre class=code>
' with boxing
interface IPublisher
    method Publish:void(event:string, data:Object)
    method Subscribe:void(subscriber:ISubscriber, event:string)
    method Unsubscribe:void(subscriber:ISubscriber, event:string)
end

' with generics
interface IPublisher&lt;T&gt;
    method Publish:void(event:string, data:T)
    method Subscribe:void(subscriber:ISubscriber, event:string)
    method Unsubscribe:void(subscriber:ISubscriber, event:string)
end
</pre><br><br>Subscriber<br><pre class=code>
interface ISubscriber
    method OnEventPublished:void(event:string, data:Object)
end
</pre><br><br>To adapt your code:<br><br><pre class=code>
Class Player extends Publisher ' &lt;-- make a base Publisher class to extend which does the bookkeeping for you
    method Score:void(amount:int) property
        score = amount
        Publish("score-changed", BoxInt(score)) ' &lt;-- all the subscribers to the "score-changed" event get notified
    end
    private field score:Int = 0
End Class

Function Main()
	New Test()
End

Class Test Extends App implements ISubscriber

        Method New()
             player = New Player
             player.Subscribe(self, "score-changed") ' &lt;-- subscribe to topics, from now on you'll get notified of changes
        end

	Method OnUpdate()
	    if KeyHit(KEY_ESCAPE) then Error ""
	    Player.Score = Player.Score + 1
	    Print "Player.score:" + Player.score
	    Print "score watch:" + scoreWatch
	End Method

        Method OnEventPublished:void(event:string, data:Object)
            ' you react on the event notifications here
            Select event
                Case "score-changed"
                    scoreWatch = UnboxInt(data) ' or you receive data from the publisher,
                    ' scoreWatch = player.Score   ' or you ask for the data yourself

It sounds like you're really on the way to needing something along the lines of an achievements system.<br><br>How I've done this in the past is to create a GameStats class, which is essentially a StringMap to Int at its core. This allows values to be registered by name and has utility functions like SetIfGreater/SetIfLesser. It also provides a subscriber/listener interface as Itto mentions above. The stats class can be saved/initialised via JSON/XML/whatever to allow or defaults or save states. So, with this in place I can create things like a "PlayerScore" stat, "Level1Beaten" stat, "EnemiesKilled" stat etc. and have a central place to update them and to check their values or listen for changes.<br><br>In addition to this I created an Achievements class. This listens for changes to the stats class and checks the values to see if certain conditions are met. Again, this provides a subscriber/listener interface so that systems can listen for these higher level events. The achievements themselves are defined in JSON, which allows them to be easily changed or added to:<br><br><pre class=code>
[{"name":"viewedHelp", "requirements":[{"statname":"viewedHelp","checktype":"&gt;","value":0}]},
 {"name":"level0Complete", "requirements":[{"statname":"level0Complete","checktype":"=","value":1}]},
 {"name":"level0**", "requirements":[{"statname":"level0Time","checktype":"&lt;","value":3600}]},
 {"name":"level0***", "requirements":[{"statname":"level0Time","checktype":"&lt;","value":2500}]}
]
</pre><br><br>As the example JSON shows, the system isn't limited to tracking things that are strictly achievements. You can use it for housekeeping all sorts of player behaviour like whether they've seen the help or done the tutorial.<br><br>Another handy thing about this setup is that it easily interfaces with pretty much all of the standard achievement systems out there on places like Kongregate/Steam etc. The amount of extra wiring to be done is minimal. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'm taking what muddy and itto said and starting to implement a GameStats class for my next project.  For the version I'm trying, I want GameStat to be an interface (possibly generic) which requires implementing a Value property and a ToJSON:JsonValue property.  However, I'm not sure if I'm going to be going about this the right way.<br><br>What I'm looking to do is to have the GameStats (manager class) be extendible so that convenience properties can be added to an individual game or set of stats.  I'm thinking that this would this be the best way to handle reducing the amount of boilerplate necessary to access a stat var, but then it might potentially increase the amount of boilerplate needed to  add new stats to the collection quite a bit.  "Helper" classes (GameStatInt, GameStatString, GameStatBool, etc) could alleviate this, but the main idea here is to try to reduce the amount of writing needed to have a system like this.  If it requires more boilerplate than my old way of doing things (Bussing a lot of variables to/from Savestate-compatible classes to JSON as needed), it might not be any better than what I'd be currently using.  Being able to watch variables at runtime seems like a nice bonus for this, but I'm questioning both the overhead and the potential amount of extra typing that this may bring... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
