I saw a lot of people asking for this and seeing how dizzy a DrawTexturedPolygon function grow in the BlitzMax archive I would prefer to have this out of the box with Monkey.<br><br>Thanks for any answers ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But since monkey is a GC language, you need something to keep an eye on the imported library. It's during the trans-coding that Monkey will start to wrap strange GC functions around your non-GC code.<br><br>I was working a little with Mark on this, but I haven't had the time to investigate fully.<br><br>Additionally, we need a way for monkey to include pre-compiled static libs during compile time.<br><br>Here's some notes on my OSX attempts.
