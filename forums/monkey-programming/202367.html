While I was there I chatted a little to some people, a few were fairly big in the indie scene. I asked if they had heard of Monkey and it seemed a fair few had!<br><br>However...<br><br>Most people had the view that monkey was really only focused on html5 or simplified games and no-one really knew what was happening with it or what its real "powers" were. Terry Cavanagh (creator of VVVVVV) said he liked the idea of coding in basic but shared the opinion that it didn't seem a suitable language feature-wise.<br><br>I think perhaps monkey needs to connect a bit more with the indie community and drive the message home. It is a more than capable language especially compared to some of the alternatives so its a shame that it isn't currently being recognised for it.<br><br>I will also be going to the new meetup group in Cambridge <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-Game-Developers/" target="_blank">http://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-Game-Developers/</a> so I am sure I can pass on some more feedback from there! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I for one will continue to pimp and go on about monkey at every opportunity, it offers something few other languages do, which is brilliant.<br><br>I think the demo SHOULD!. list all targets in the build option, if they pick a target thats not html5 then it should just throw a popup saying something like "To build for your xbox 360, please buy the full version".<br><br>All of that aside, What it really needs is some magazine coverage, getting into the press will really help spread the word, so dont know who handles marketing for BRL but they could use some help. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The constant reminder to the user that they are only getting a fraction of the feature set is important (As long as its not too annoying)!<br><br>I think there would definitely be a huge benefit for some kind of tech demo's to be commissioned with art and code to really impress. These can then be passed around the scene. Of course that's an expensive thing for me to easily just shout that would be a good idea, but based on teh reactions at the tigjam I reckon Monkey needs SOMETHING to sway peoples opinions. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Monkey is a great programing language, and it would be great if people do know it. Couldn't a closed source version of the mojo module for GLFW be done (in the form of a static lib or similar) so it can be bundled with the demo, without the mojo source code, and with a watermark or something like this? this could be helpful if it can be freely distributed by some magazines and online techy blogs. Just an idea... I have no idea how much complicated this would be for Mark, but it couldn't hurt monkey sales and reputation. I'll glad add a free demo version of Jungle to this package. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

HTML-5 could be nice but in practice it's a pain due to synchronisation, streaming, performance and sound issues. So for me monkey is only good for iOS, the rest of it isn't up to a quality level i would expect it to be. Maybe it will just take one, two or three years to get there but at the moment the usage of monkey is very limited.<br><br>In January i did a quick test in which i could get a certain project done the best. Tried Ruby, Processing, monkey, BlitzMax, Unity and Objective C. All had their ups and downs but whilst i did enjoy monkey's language, i certainly did not enjoy certain restrictions in the language and the fighting when it came to dealing with media. Unity blows away monkey in this aspect. It's not fun to code in Unity but you just get things done. And when things which can't be done with Unity, due to a lack of features or bugs, you're taking Objective-C directly, because then you can access all of the system's capabilities.<br><br>I have the feeling that the way Mark deals with BlitzMax and monkey, he subdivided his market even more, like he once already did with offering BlitzMax but without a 3D module. And if things don't dramatically change then monkey will be one of those weird languages which might be cool but no one cares about to use because a development process involves a little bit more than just having a cool programming language.<br><br>Anyway i would love to see monkey to focus and enhance significantly and/or a monkey/Ruby like language in Unity. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

People chose nokia just because it was the way things were done. There were other choices, but nokia were the mainstream choices...<br><br>Then, just like that, apple came along and turned everything upside down. They throw some pretty visuals, slick interface, less functionality, some inmissable marketing and wow just like that they gone and changed 'the way things have been done'. 4 years later the era of Nokia "smart phones" seems like a distant and terrible memory, iPhones are the defacto and apple are one of the most successful companies.... Ever. That's not to say apple are perfect an their products are unbeatable, it's just to say that they set out to change people's minds and pulled it off!<br><br>Just because the likes of unity and actionscript-based frameworks seem like the defacto and mainstream choices, all it takes is something to impact users and sway their decisions and everything can change!<br><br><br>I am incredibly happy with blitzmax, maxgui, monkey, blide, jungleide and pretty much anything that seems to come from the community surrounding "blitz", i will continue to promote it at any "events" I goto.. But tbh I don't think I can do it justice chattering on in a noisy room full of semi tipsy/drunk event-goers, it needs something more... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
