For some reason, it just feels wrong, but maybe it's not the mouse control that's the issue. Just a straight left/right movement (firing is continuous) with aliens at the top of the screen. Has anyone got any basic tips for making shoot-em-up games? I think I played one which was mouse controlled once and it was ok, but I can't find it now. To be honest, if I switch to keyboard control it still doesn't quite feel right, so are there any tips for this kind of game? Or is it maybe just a case of constantly tinkering with the speeds/movement until it comes together? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'll put up the current demo at some point, although it's only half the game, so I'll seperate it from the other half and show you what I mean. I realise it's hard to judge without a demo, was just wondering if there are some basic tips to make shoot-em-ups work.<br><br>The ship does move 'towards' the mouse X position, but max 10 pixels at a time, so it's not too fast.<br><br>I think the real problem is that it just feels boring. But then again, having played a million similar games in the past, maybe I'm just bored of the genre.<br><br>I'll try to show a demo tonight. Cheers. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

However, i did play a few that uses the mouse which also worked out fairly well too. Several months back, I did started working on a shooter that was mouse controlled that sort of had a delayed movement to it (so that its not directly on the mouse's coordinates but rather follows it a based on the velocity). May post a little demo later, if i can dig up the code for it somewhere.. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The basic layout of my shooter is that there's a mothership at the top - very big - and she's protected by a layer of defence ships which tend to saturate the centre of the screen with bullets, forcing the player out to the sides. Then there are little fighters that harass you out there, but not so much. So it just became an issue of moving to the sides, waiting for the bullets to leave a gap, then popping in for a few shots. I think you're right, it's the difficulty that's the problem, not so much the mouse control. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
