Please don't feel as though your topics or posts aren't valid because there's been previous threads about the subject. If you have problems with my modules, or simply want to drum up a discussion about something, there's nothing wrong with that. Similarly, <u>if you're having trouble understanding something, don't feel bad about it</u>, that's what we're here for.<br><br>Anyway, from your specific description, you're definitely looking for 'regal.transport' over 'regal.networking', as you may have already guessed. 'regal.networking' is not a low-level transfer API, it has its own protocol behavior and formatting on top of the transport scheme. Supporting this "specification" in another language is asking for headaches. Plus, I might end up optimizing it later down the road, anyway.<br><br>The 'regal.transport' module doesn't have this bloat, but that also means it isn't as "feature rich". For raw transfers like this, it's perfectly fine, though. 'regal.transport' also has no dependencies other than the official modules, so it's well suited for this kind of thing. <u>If you're still interested in using raw sockets instead of 'regal.transport', there's nothing stopping you</u>, though.<br><br>So, you said you were getting "garbage data", what are we talking about here? I imagine the connection was made just fine on the Visual Basic side of things, and the Monkey code reflects this? If not, be sure the "Basic_IO" Monkey example is working correctly before anything else. The module's not perfect, it could be on my end.<br><br>Assuming that it's making the connection, I need to know what you're doing to read and write. Are you reading lines from the Monkey client, or are you sending raw data like integers or floats? I need a bit more context. Maybe you could post the source code, or a suitable test program, so I could take a crack at it? I'm a bit rusty with VB, but I could probably help debug it.<br><br>P.S. If you have any questions about installing the Regal Modules, feel free to ask me here. For 'regal.transport', it should be installed in "modules/regal/transport", where "modules" is your preferred/configured modules-directory. With that said, 'regal.transport' is entirely portable, so you could install it however you like.<br><br>I'll be going to bed shortly, so it may take a while to get back to you.

Game sends message to server in form of a split string (for example: "#|123.234.32.23|LOGIN")
Server reads message, does some backend database stuff and sends back a message "!|ACK|19384"
Game then uses this info for various game-related things, and then sends back another message such as "?|19384" (I'm oversimplifying everything, but this is roughly how it'll work)
The game then waits for the server to send a gamestart message.
The game then sends a request to the server.
The server then send a response to this request.
The game acts upon this response, and waits for the player.  In the meantime, more server messages may come in without any further requests, which the game would act on accordingly.
This cycle continues until game end.</pre><br>Now, I already have the server side working to send and receive messages sent from Packet Sender, so I know that code is working.  <br>I am just having a lot of problems wrapping my head around the easiest way to implement this into Monkey.  Using the TCPEchoServer example, I honestly cannot separate the echo from receiving external data.<br>Transport seemed to be working, but it seems the databuffer was not clearing after each message and leaving garbage data in the buffer.  Unfortunately, I'm not clever enough to figure out how to close/clear the buffer.<br><br>Thats pretty much it I think, but I'll try to explain in more detail if needed.<br><br>And my steak and chicken was lush :P  Although crockpot cooked chicken... mmmm now that would be nice too... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

</pre><br><br>I mainly just copied all the methods from the example IO code, and modified to be more what I require.  I think that the adding clients code is probably not needed, as there will only ever be one 'client' which would be the server.<br><br>When I run this, the game listens for connections as expected, and when it receives data, it receives a garbled version of it.  If I resend something, it shows the previous data, and other garbage characters.

This should help you understand how to apply them to this situation. It'll be done shortly, and when it is, I'll post a link to it here.<br><br>For packets, though; both 'Server' and 'Client' classes work as packet managers/pools. You can find <a href="https://github.com/Regal-Internet-Brothers/transport/blob/master/packetmanager.monkey" target="_blank">the 'PacketManager' class in "regal/transport/packetmanager.monkey"</a>, if you'd like to handle them separately. With that said, however, you really don't need to do that here.<br><br>From any 'Client' object, you can use the 'AllocatePacket' method to allocate a packet handle, and the 'Free' method to release the handle. This behavior isn't specific to the 'Server' or 'Client' classes, they both can do this.<br><br>When a packet handle is released, it gives the module the right to restore the object whenever it deems necessary. This means that if you send synchronously ('Send'), the application will be blocked the needed amount to ensure the connection is stable, then to copy the data, then give you back control of the 'Packet'.<br><br>So, if you're using 'Send', you just need to ensure you use your object's 'Free' method (Or manage 'Packet' objects yourself). Once again, the object in question can be a 'Client' or 'Server' object.<br><br>Now, the behavior I just described is in contrast to 'SendAsync', which is a contract to the object ('Client' or 'Server') that you will no longer use the 'Packet' object in question. This means if you call 'SendAsync', you're saying that you won't call 'Send', 'SendAsync', or a similar method on that 'Packet' object again. Of course, you could always write and allocate new 'Packet' objects while the other one is in transit, but the original 'Packet' handle is no longer valid.<br><br>This is why the 'Basic_IO' example uses 'Send' instead of 'SendAsync', because it's sending to many end-points ('NetworkUser' handles) one after another. If it was doing this asynchronously ('SendAsync'), it would be required to allocate a new 'Packet' object for each 'NetworkUser' it sends to. Though that may be effective in some situations, in the example, we can just send to everyone synchronously, cutting out ownership problems.<br><br>My '<a href="https://github.com/Regal-Internet-Brothers/ioutil/blob/master/repeater.monkey" target="_blank">regal.ioutil.repeater</a>' module may be useful if you intend to write to multiple 'Packet' objects at the same time, by the way. It's a default module if you have the others installed. It's not directly related to 'regal.transport', though.<br><br>At any rate, to restore a 'Packet' object's internal position, simply call the 'Reset' method. Calling the standard 'Seek' method will also work with this class. This is done automatically if you use 'Free' and 'AllocatePacket', so you won't have to worry about the object when using those. Just keep the 'SendAsync' behavior in mind (Don't call 'Free' on an asynchronous 'Packet').<br><br>Sorry for the late response, I had to look through the code and remember what I did when I wrote this. The example I mentioned before will be done shortly. It's not going to be grandiose, but it should help. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
