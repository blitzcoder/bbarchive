It should remove all of that object data including any fields that use custom data types (that's basically what a class is). The only data member that should not be affected is any declared global or constant as it's seen by all instances of a class. If you want to make sure that such non global objects get removed: set it to a value of Null before you remove the parent class. The GC should get rid of it when it detects that it's not being used.<br>Don't forget you would have to iterate through that list using the EachIn command to ensure that each object in the list is parsed.<br><br>By the way. The code in the main() would never work as you would have to call the create function to add data to the list. Just doing New method would just give you an empty object.

As I haven't seen any big issues with the GC for quite a while. Unless mteo77 is using the v70 experimental and some new bugs (or old problems) have come to light.<br><br>@mteo77<br>A couple of tips.<br>1) Always use strict mode. Doing this helps to eliminate most code bugs and mistakes.<br>2) Write small test code modules before integrating it to the main project code and always organise the code in a modular fashion by placing your large class declarations into separate files. Any small class declarations that are in some way essential to only that one class should go there as well. Any other small class declarations that can be used by all other classes should be grouped into their own file.<br>3) Be mindful when dealing with floats, integer numbers and on the odd occasion custom data types. Assigning a float to a integer data type looses the floats precision (e.g. 0.5 will become just 0). Monkey is smart enough to know what to cast a data type to most of the time, but sometimes you may need to explicitly cast it to ensure that it's enforced.<br>4) If possible study other people's code for ideas on how they solved their problem.<br>5) If you using a Windows OS. Buy Jungle IDE as the built in live code debugger save a fair bit of time.<br><br>Edit:<br>There is one way that I can think of where a memory leak as such could happen and that is if you define a member field that is to be used as a reference to another single instance of a object (like one that's in a list of objects). Removing that object instance doe's not automatically remove it's reference within that member field and there for would just reference junk data. In this situation you should set the member field to Null so the GC can get rid of it.<br><br>E.g. If you have a homing missile that has a field that is used as a reference to an enemy object instance as for targeting and that enemy is destroyed by another means. Then the missiles reference to that enemy objects instance becomes invalid and points to junk data and would just go round and round the last point the the enemy use to be. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Trying to use some else's code without full understanding how it works and the necessary programming concepts is just asking for disaster. It's even worse if there is a lack of documentation.<br><br>I tend to prefer writing my own code from the ground up as I think it is more flexible than using some else's code. And I also reuse many classes that I've written myself and from time to time I'll improve them with tweaks. Not only that it's also much more satisfying knowing that I myself have done the grafted.<br><br>To start with write a dozen or so simple games just using Monkey only and then try rewriting them using something like diddy. Then have ago at writing them using the ignition frame work. But then again once you've mastered monkey and written some of your own classes modules you may come to the conclusion that it's not worth the hassle to learn some else's framework. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You have your waves class to organise generation of enemies, but I bet you also add them to some other list (perhaps in the Ignition framework, or perhaps in your own code).  Your waves are no longer the only things that remember enemies, so when the waves disappear the enemies persist.  Something is drawing them, I'd guess the framework (I don't use it so I can't tell). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
