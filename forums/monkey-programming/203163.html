Doing a bit of research online, and there seem to be quite a few suggested techniques for achieving this - the simplest being to punch holes in an image by explicitly masking out pixels in the source texture. Having had a dig around in the monkey code, it doesn't appear like there's any support for anything like that (ie. directly manipulating pixels in a texture) at the generic language level, although it could feasibly be added with a bit of modification to the various native platform code files.<br><br>Before I continue down this road, I was just wondering if anyone else ever tried tackling these problems in Monkey before? (either the terrain issue, or runtime texture modification). If so, do you have any advice/tips/warnings/words of wisdom? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I imagine this would be very slow to render, but would be a nice simple way of managing collisions.<br><br>You could do things in reverse. Have a solid repeating texture for the whole level/screen and then draw "holes" on top of it. All of the in game items would be free to move as long as they are overlapping a hole, if they are not, they've hit a solid edge/wall.<br><br>Over all though I wouldn't say Monkey is a realistic target (yet?) for such a game. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Yeah, Taiphoz, that seemed to be the other sort of approach that people were suggesting - as you say though, its less than ideal, and doesn't sound particularly friendly towards mobile devices (from a memory/rendering point of view). Will mull the idea over and post back here if I decide to pursue it.<br><br>cheers! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you want something else you will have to write native code for your target platforms (unless someone has already done so, have a dig around just in case).  Then you can probably hack it into mojo if you want to use them simultaneously.<br><br>Of course the code related to modifiable terrain is likely to be only a small part of any given game, so you could still do everything else in Monkey/mojo if you wanted. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
