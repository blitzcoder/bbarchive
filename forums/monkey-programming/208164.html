I suspect most people would end up essentially reusing a whole framework structure and that would include things like system globals. The problems only occur if you want to pull out a single system and discover that it's full of global references that you don't want to take too. To be honest that's really just a dependency issue though -- if all those global references were made non-global you'd still have a problem with extracting the system.<br><br>As with pretty much every software engineering principle there are cost and benefits and pragmatism needs to be applied. The internet is full of puritans, mostly fresh from a software engineering class taught by someone who has never created a large commercial software system, who will speak from a metaphorical pulpit on the one true way with no regard for the realities of any specific situation.<br><br>When talking about globals as "bad" we need to consider what sort of global usage we're talking about. I once worked on a system where they had somehow ended up with over a hundred shared global primitives. These were freely used by anyone who felt the need and the code contained multiple instances of people using a "rarely referenced" global as a temp variable completely at random. This was definitely <i>bad</i> and would be bad even if working alone. On the other hand mojo clearly has global state all over the place for things like the rendering colour, alpha, font etc. Is this bad? I'd suggest that the answer is "yes, in certain circumstances, but generally only if you want to use it in a way not intended".<br><br>If someone were to argue that avoiding globals has benefits with testability/modularity, I would agree. If they were to argue that you should therefore never allow global references of any kind, ban singletons and always use dependency injection in all code then I'd suggest they're being unreasonably dogmatic. You should certainly question shared writeable global state. You should also try to limit system dependencies of all kinds and it's better not to use a global where a dependency exists. However, sometimes things are genuinely global in nature and sometimes simple convenience is a factor for productivity. I wonder how many code purity crusaders seriously use dependency injection to pass a reference to their Logging class to everything they write for example. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Worse, the globals don't have a consistent naming convention, so everything's all kinds of effed up.  One of the people involved with the code at one point was clearly a C++ programmer, because he honored the code with a couple globals we can't get rid of that start with "g_", and some classes I managed to refactor out that had fields that started with "m_".
