The tricky thing about including all of that stuff standard is that the further away you get from the most basic of functions, the harder it is to keep them up with the times.  <br><br>Rather than depreciate parts of mojo or all of mojo in the future, it would be easy, for example, to depreciate a networking library if it later ends up being that the paradigm for the library is too confusing or wacky, or is made obsolete by a newer, more streamlined paradigm, library, or whatever.  Mojo itself is supposed to be there to give you the boilerplate code to get a simple game running;  images, sounds, input, and basic I/O.  <br><br>I'd be lying if I didn't want more stuff in there to help make a game, like per-pixel collision routines, more containers, simple objects like vectors and the like, but all of that stuff adds to the complexity of the lib.  Take Diddy for example;  why not add all of this extra stuff to it?  There's certainly a case to be made for it, though the more stuff the lib gets thrown on top, the more cumbersome the library is to keep up to date. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

At the moment it doesn't include anything to do with networking but there's equally no real argument for saying that it should. What does "networking" support mean anyway? It's a pretty broad area. Is there an example of a library in another language that would be considered to offer complete networking support?<br><br>In terms of some features not being available on some platforms, that's already true. See ChannelState, for example. In the long run it seems more sensible to figure out how to make such variations easier to handle rather than fixate on not providing anything that can't be supported on every single possible platform. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'm sure someone here can come up with some brilliant solutions that are doable, at least on Mark's side of things in the future when he works on mojo hackability.<br><br>Handy Features for Extending Modules (not only mojo)<br>* Replace Method in class from external file (replace method)<br>* Add Method/Field/Global/Function to Class in external file (extention method - need to be imported before the target file in question)<br>* Add extends/implements to class in external file (used to make module compatible with an interface of your own)<br>* Target platform specific extendability - Should be made possible by the extension methods/replace methods<br><br>Such hacks needs to be updated each time the interface to the module/file they operate on are changed - however should be an easy fix. And even those, like muddy_shoes that hack their own mojo will probably have an easier time at updates, and the code will be sharable.<br><br>Actually such system could easily be created on the IDE side of things instead of being part of the Monkey language, quite similar to a batch file, only a bit smarter. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Mojo is a high-level interface and if you want to make low level changes there's an inevitable need to mess with the internals. <br><br>Off-screen rendering is an example where deep changes are unavoidable. My stuff pretty much takes mojo's graphics classes and allows you to create multiple render buffers that offer mojo's rendering api plus the ability to render buffers to buffers, e.g.:<br><br>[monkeycode]<br>    'create new buffer<br>    Local buffer:RenderBuffer = New OffScreenRenderBuffer(200, 200)<br>    buffer.BeginRender()<br>    buffer.Cls(64,64,255)<br>    buffer.SetColor(255,45,45)<br>    buffer.DrawRect(20,20,30,50)<br>    buffer.SetColor(255,255,255)<br>    typeface.DrawText(buffer,"Test Text",10,10)<br>    buffer.EndRender()<br><br>    'draw buffer to screen<br>    buffer.DrawToScreen(0, 0, 50, 50, buffer.Width, buffer.Height)<br><br>    Local secondbuffer:RenderBuffer = New OffScreenRenderBuffer(200, 200)<br>    'draw buffer to second buffer<br>    secondbuffer.DrawRenderBuffer(buffer, 0, 0, 10, 10, buffer.Width, buffer.Height)		<br>[/monkeycode]<br><br>It's difficult to see how mojo could support that via a plugin system or similar as it is completely changing the way it works currently.<br><br>Exposing some of those internals would avoid a bit of the merging work but wouldn't be desirable in general. At the moment Mark can legitimately change anything behind the interface and it's tough cheese if any of us have messed with it. If he makes it public then he's locked into maintaining those internals as is to a certain extent. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
