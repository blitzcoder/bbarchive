Then I replaced all 'Function' with 'Method' and all 'Global' and 'Local' with 'Field'. What comes next is having to change the odd thing like adding an ":Int" to where I didn't declare anything and then for 2 dimensional or more arrays having [2*2] instead of for example [2,2]<br><br>Eventually I was able to compile after about 5 or so hours of going through all the errors that came up whilst compiling.<br><br>Whilst there is still a lot of work to do my program now compiles. For sure my program will probably crash if I call certain old functions the fact I can test each function individually really helps.<br><br>I can call any of my old code by doing something like Old.MyFunction()<br>This lets me see clearly which is monkey and blitzmax code, I have where needed copy and pasted old functions out of the old file and converted that into Monkey Code. Dunno if that will work for you but it's nice to be able to work on some old code and get that working without having to try and fix EVERYTHING in one go before the damn thing will compile. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The biggest single problem I had was case sensitivity.  Didn't realise how sloppy I was on the subject until I started using a language that constantly pulls me up on it.<br><br>Its taken me til about an hour ago to get it to compile.  So, probably 60 hours of work.  Sounds a long time but I've written a rudimentary filesystem class and a timer replacement class and a load of other bits along the way.<br><br>Now to get it to actually run and... you know... work! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
