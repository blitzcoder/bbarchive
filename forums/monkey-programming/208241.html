</textarea><br><br>Monkey always deals with objects and external types as pointers, so you need to keep that in mind. For example, if you have ' Class Short="short" ', it won't let you use it as a 'short', only a short-pointer (Without something like the hacks I mentioned above). The method I posted above should basically work, it's just not the best of options.<br><br>I know from experience that this is annoying, I tried wrapping the Windows API with Monkey, and it was a pain. I only got a hand-full of the commands and types done before realizing how ridiculous it was maintaining it. On the bright side, it worked amazingly well, but I just couldn't go on writing a mess like that. I may eventually just write a program to generate this kind of thing for me, but for now, this works.<br><br>EDIT: Just for the record, you'd still need to make your own system for generating a 'DWORD' container or other such method. Or hack together something in Monkey. I've been confusing the hell out of myself just writing this post, so that should tell you what you'd be getting into with this method. This also tends to make the debugger freak out a lot.<br><br><br>If you really want to go through the hassle, you can make it pretty much as nice as this:<br><textarea class=codebox name="code" wrap=OFF readonly="true" rows="15" cols="80">
Function EmptyWorkingSet:Bool()
	' Local variable(s):
	Local hProcess:= windows.ADDROF(GetCurrentProcess())
	Local Response:= EmptyWorkingSet(windows.DEREF(hProcess))
	
	' Close the handle, then delete its container:
	CloseHandle(windows.DEREF(hProcess))
	windows.Delete(hProcess)
	
	' Return the response.
	Return Response
End
</textarea><br><br>The best option is usually a wrapper function or class written in C++, then brought into Monkey via 'Extern'. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

With C++ a memory address can contain anything.  So Monkey translates to a version of C++ in which everything is referenced by pointers, but this doesn't fit well with native code written in a 'closer to the metal' idiom.  Anyway, that's my guess, <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The only big difference between Monkey X's generated code, and native C++ code is that objects written in Monkey X are deleted by a garbage collector, and we can't use 8-bit and 16-bit registers (And their respective data-types) without hacking them in. (And the generated code is horribly messy and compiled as one object) That, and Monkey doesn't tend to use the STL, but that's more of a standardization thing, than a language thing. In fact, I actually have gotten std::string to work perfectly in Monkey X. Using pointers tends to be a more hardware specific task (Albeit somewhat agnostic in C++), as you're purely dealing with memory (At least from the eyes of the client application). Monkey X's approach currently seems to be to only stack-allocate what it sees fit, and to allocate everything else on the heap, and manage it itself. This is something I don't really like about Monkey. Why can't I at the very least 'extern-in' something that uses the stack, and not have to worry about containers or hacks? Because return values tend to be handled by registers, C++ doesn't allow you to use the '&amp;' operator on functions; this means the only way to use Monkey to get the value is to hack something together when the return-type isn't already a pointer.<br><br>At the end of the day, my hack works well enough, but it's a pain to work around, and it's honestly only efficient when dealing with pointers. That being said, the interface at least looks nice, even if it takes a while to get it that nice. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
