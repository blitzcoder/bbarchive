Also, realize that my example was just that, an example. Just because there are different ways of doing something, that doesn't mean one way is always ideal. Personally, I'd agree that using an update-rate of zero isn't a bad idea, but at the same time, this is generally driver and system dependent. For example, on my system, and many other systems setting the update-rate to zero results in unlimited updating and rendering. This is seriously wasteful for simple examples like this, heck, even 60 FPS is utterly ridiculous. But since the vast majority of monitors run at 60, I thought it would be better for an example. It's not like the official examples are any different (Yes, I'm aware zero wasn't an option a while ago). And since the 'SetUpdateRate' command itself is already a request, and not a demand, I don't see giving an explicit update-rate as a bad thing. It's not like rendering should actually matter to a game-engine, to begin with. Mojo simply uses this as the assumed framerate. If I remember right, Mojo has some code to skip rendering when updating could be done quick enough, but the rendering step could not.<br><br>Also, it's pretty obvious therevills was trying to right something quick and to the point. My issue was that he didn't even bother to check if it worked or not. That, and he was using unneeded implicit casts to booleans, which were used in conditions where the return values were undefined, mind you. And, you know, returning 'True' on the 'Main' function, something which some systems see as an error code. Just as an example, the "stdlib.h"/"cstdlib" header(s) on Windows (As implemented by several versions of Visual C++) define 'EXIT_FAILURE' as 1, which is what he was effectively returning. If you're a Windows user, and you see a message to the effect of "Did this program work correctly for you?", that's the kind of behavior you can expect from the OS under certain circumstances. A new Monkey user should not make these mistakes.<br><br>If it wasn't obvious already, I'm the kind of person who makes his code as consistent as possible. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The main problem I had was that it didn't even render for me, but it didn't help that you were going against the docs. I see now that this could have been related to Windows's display server screwing up, as it didn't display anything for me initially. Plus, I'm not too sure if Mojo technically guarantees that 'OnRender' will be called without an update-rate. And tell me again, how does the fact that I wrote more than you do anything but enforce my point even further? I don't hold people to the same standards as myself, first of all. But I expect at least some effort in the way of consistency (One of your methods doesn't even end the same way). Also, the official documentation says that for future compatibility, most, if not all of the "OnBlah" methods should return zero. It is not clear at all when there's two types ('Bool' and 'Int'), and you're throwing around implicit casts where it's unneeded. Also, your last remark of "Think before you write" completely contradicts your first argument, which itself was an argument with no basis.<br><br>Look, he wanted to start learning Monkey, and I think following standard practice if, for nothing else, the expected behavior for Mojo is the best course of action. Stylistic differences aside, the code you posted was lazily put together, and I seriously don't blame you for it. Considering you've made Diddy, which works great from what I've tried, I expected a more consistent example. That's it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
