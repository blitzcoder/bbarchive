I have been targeting HTML5 for convenience and experimented briefly with Flash and iOS targets just to check it loads.<br><br>However as a complete noob, I have a number of questions which hopefully the monkey community can help me with. <br><br>So here goes: <br><br>- When I build a flash version the graphics look rough, as in they are not anti-aliased. Is this just how the flash version will look? while the HTML5 target the graphics look crisp?<br><br>- Might be related but all my assets are .png - when I save them I set the compression level to the highest - 9. Is this the setting people are generally using?<br><br>- I want to target iPad and iPhone. Should I keep a seperate set of assets for each target? I currently receive the assets in iPad 3 resolution and convert to 640*480. <br><br>When I tested the game on iPhone it did display but is that Monkey upscaling the assets to the correct resolution? <br><br>I am also using Diddy so perhaps that is scaling?<br><br>I am slightly confused as you can tell about the best way to approach graphics for multiple targets. If anyone can explain their method I would be grateful.<br><br>- Gameplay on the different screen sizes. I noticed when I tested on the iPhone the touch screen controls were out of sync (for example touching a button on the browser version was perfect, but on the iphone I had to touch down and to the right to press the same button) <br><br>I presume this is because I have coded the gameplay to a 640*480 resolution and need separate version targeting the specific resolutions? Again any explanation or a method to manage the variations in targets would be gratefully received. <br><br>Thanks for any help in advance. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Certainly it does use anti-aliasing, although it's possible the details of how it does it are different.<br><br>Diddy does have a scaling option, but I don't use it, so I don't know if it's on by default.  You could always make a simple test project that does the minimum, and try it on everything.<br><br>If you are targeting devices of different sizes, you probably need different assets too if you are not happy with scaling.  Adjusting layout depending on device width and height may be useful too.<br><br>Your touch issue definitely seems to indicate that some scaling is happening to the graphics and not the mouse, i.e. the graphics are shrunk so your button at 400,300 is displayed at pixel 300,225 but you still are requiring a touch at 400,300.  If you scale the graphics, you must scale the mouse/touch too, in reverse.  Here's a little module I wrote recently, when I realised I needed scaling for Androids with small screens:<br><br><textarea class=codebox name="code" wrap=OFF readonly="true" rows="15" cols="80">

If you have a lot of horizontal lines of the same colour, PNG will use run-length encoding and be very compact - it's often a great choice for button graphics etc.  On the other hand, if you have a photographic-type image, you will be able to get in a lot of extra compression with JPG.  So the optimal choice will probably be a mixture of both. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
