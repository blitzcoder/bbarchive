Is it worth using sparse tiles in the level textfiles?<br><br>Most of the map will be either empty or filled with stone.  Open areas in the map will be carved out of a map previously filled with stone.  There will be a map-scanning pass at runtime which replaces borders between stone and empty with the appropriate wall tiles.<br><br>Is it worth doing a sparse level structure?  The above is semi-sparse but it strikes me that since wide open areas are mostly rectangular it would be much smaller to store empty areas as rectangles of various sizes, either defined during design phase (using a rectangle tool for carving out large areas) or when the map is saved.  Compare the tilemap sizes in typical platformers with the sizes of the same maps saved as the actions of various tools on the level structure, and replayed at runtime to rebuild the same structure.<br><br>Does the space savings and level-load savings justify the somewhat greater effort of writing this sort of tool-action save and replay system?  Would it be worthwhile getting the level size down to a few tens of bytes?  <br><br>Something like a list of<br><br>uppercorner, lowercorner, tiletype<br><br>Individual tiles and lines of tiles made with a line tool could be saved in the same format.<br><br>Thoughts?  Should I bother or just use a conventional tilemap for the filestructure?<br><br>It strikes me that this sort of structure would be small enough that 100 or so levels could be baked into the executable at compile time. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
