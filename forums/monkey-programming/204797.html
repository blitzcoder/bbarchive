BlitzMax builds are time tested and solid. You can trust them for release. Official is good because it means it is commercially supported and so more likely to be updated and improved to the most ideal setup. You want things to JUST WORK with every update. Mark does a great job with Monkey but I still wish he would hire more guys to work full time with him creating and updating targets and making them the best possible. Android active wallpaper target plz?<br><br>GLFW isn't redundant. It is a good build target for certain audiences. The great thing about the BM target is supporting older hardware. BlitzMax builds work on older hardware which many audiences still have. It would make sense to support as many commercially viable targets as possible because those are the targets which people with money will want to have supported.<br><br>If I didn't care about things being commercially supported I'd still be using Haxe. I use Monkey because I don't want to worry about all of that stuff. I want to make games, build them, and sell them. If I cared about money too I'd use Haxe also. It's free, and does everything Monkey is capable of, and more often than not coders prefer its syntax, and yet because it is not commercially supported it does not get anywhere near the level of support Mark gives Monkey.<br><br>&gt; if you want new users to adopt monkey, then do not make them buy another product. <br><br>There are much more pressing issues with the ability of Monkey to sell (I've listed many before). Needing to buy BM to make BM builds is a low of an issue as needing to buy Android or iOS hardware to test those targets. For commercial devs, it is 100% a non-issue.<br><br>Stop trying to appeal to hobby coders who don't use Monkey to make money and who pinch their pennies as far as they can go.<br><br>Focus more on commercial developers who are more than happy to take our money for things which we want to support. <br><br>Look at the difference between Monkey and other tools. Monkey is the cheapest thing out there. If price mattered it would be selling the most, right? But instead the Monkey community still has yet to break 1,000 users. Meanwhile Unity, Game Maker, Clickteam, Impact, all of those have way more users. It's marketing. Monkey is the best option for making 2D games but still people choose those other higher priced options. Hobby and commercial devs both. Why? Marketing. I wish I could help and I've suggested things but for most of my time I have to focus on my own business. I'll keep buying Monkey licenses to support Mark and wish for the b est. Can any other commercial dev beat my high score? ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Well back to the thread topic.<br><br>After working with MonkeyMax, It does seem like it would be quite rudimentary to keep uptodate with monkey but there are a few monkey headaches...<br><br>one of which is here: <a href="http://monkeycoder.co.nz/Community/posts.php?topic=4808" target="_blank">http://monkeycoder.co.nz/Community/posts.php?topic=4808</a><br><br>... which make it difficult to maintain a user-made-target in conjunction with monkey updates.<br><br>The best solution would be for monkeymax to be official, but close to that would be to make the target system more friendly when applying customisations to core modules. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
