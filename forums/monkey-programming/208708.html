If the desired input was the derived class, and not the base class, it works fine. But if the desired input is the base class, it freaks out? This is very strange to me, because the base class doesn't even have a 'ToString' implementation, but the derived class does.<br><br>So, why does the super/base class suffer from the implementation of a derived class? This sounds like the same intrusive logic applied to method overloads (Which is still ridiculous by the way).<br><br>So, if I understand this correctly; I can't make an overload for a function taking my base-class without making that class final, otherwise someone could break everything simply because they implemented 'ToString' and I didn't? But then, if I did implement it, I'd have a similar problem.<br><br>Inheriting classes and associated code should not break my own code / my base/super code, nor should my code break inheriting code. This just seems logical to me, and it's exactly why I think the current way overloads are handled between classes is complete garbage. I get the whole "Call the super-class's implementation, so your class can keep existing overloads" thing, that's awesome. But being completely locked down by the arguments my super-class describes is just frustrating and illogical. Why can't 'Trans' just pickup where it left off with names at compile-time? In the case of a method named 'M', the names from the base class would be: p_M, p_M2, and p_M3, so then why can't the derived class just continue from there: p_M4, p_M5, etc?<br><br>Anyway, my ranting aside, I suggest a bug-fix which takes the hint when you write an explicit overload. You know, without getting confused because of an UNRELATED inheriting class which wasn't even imported via the module containing the super class to begin with. Just have it pick overloads which inherit 'Object' over other data-types if one is present. And from there, keep preferring the lowest possible class (And I mean that with the mindset that inheritance goes from top (Object) to bottom (Final class(es) in the tree)) compatible with the type at hand. That'll fix this problem, it shouldn't be a hard algorithm to implement (Assuming all the meta-data's there). With that in 'Trans', it'd effectively fix everyone's problems.<br><br>SKN3's code was not at all ambiguous, and the compiler really should know this. I don't think anyone of sound mind would expect this to happen, especially with Monkey's modular philosophies.<br><br>You know what, I might just sit down and fork 'Trans' when I have the time.<br><br>Also, @Nobuyuki: I'm not sure if that's the same situation. Does the 'json' module expect classes to never be treated as objects before primitive/other data-types in the case of overloads? If it's just a matter of treating an object like a string for example, then as long as there isn't an overload expecting an 'Object', or a super-class to that class, it shouldn't even have an issue (With, or without the fix I described). Plus, in the end people can just call 'ToString', 'ToInt', and 'ToFloat' manually anyway. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The problem is that the function/method call expression container can't pass the data of the expression to 'SemantArgs', so it can do a deeper form of check. The result is unintentional conversion to the wrong overload, but then 'SemantFunc' doesn't get the memo and errors. In other words, currently, it can only know about one overload at a time (When it doesn't know if it should call 'ToString') so it'll just pick the first overload.

The better question is, if there's an overload for the actual type, why not use it? You're not really giving an answer, you're just beating around the bush and saying it'd be confusing. The fact is many of us would expect an explicit overload for THE VERY TYPE we passed in to be prioritized over some form of conversion or otherwise. Not only is this the logical conclusion, but technically speaking 'ToBlah' is a language hack itself which in my opinion should not take priority over code that was obviously built without it in mind. I'm not saying to get rid of it, as it does work quite well, and is used by plenty of people, I'm saying to not prioritize it / let it be seen as just as valuable as the actual super-class. My entire problem is exactly how 'ToBlah' was added, not that it was added. Also, the only times it would "Quietly not be used" is when there's a more logical overload to begin with. Not when there's only an overload which takes the type you can/want to convert to. Ask yourself this; would you rather use the overload which clearly takes the type you're giving, or let the compiler get hung up about things being "ambiguous" when that may very well have not been the case for the originally targeted class. Again, this only really happens when you're dealing with super-classes, meaning you could technically break something from someone else's module, simply because they decided they wanted to do something 'Trans' is too "ignorant" to detect. For a modular language this sounds way too intrusive to me. Now, to fix this issue, you could either rewrite half of trans, or you could just use something like my fix. I know you created the language, and thus should have control over it, but the whole "I won't let you make the language more logical because I never thought about every single situation." argument is just petty.<br><br>I suggest you take the time to think about this, as my post above states quite clearly how this could break someone else's code for no logical reason. If that's your final decision fine, but you honestly aren't making any sense to me. Sure my hack is just that, a hack, but the point was illustrate the idea, not necessarily provide the final implementation for future versions (Thus the whole "Development" branch thing).<br><br>EDIT: Tried to make a few things clearer. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That makes no sense to someone from a Java or similar background* where those resolution rules are generally understood but there you have it. When Mark states that having to cast an object to its own type makes more sense to him that having the compiler recognise that type over the unboxing conversion you pretty much have to shrug and accept that he's coming from rather different assumptions about how an OO language should work.<br><br>*And it makes less sense in the context that the feature itself is based on Java.

This isn't Java, it's Monkey, they aren't the same language. Monkey should have its own reasons for doing something a specific way. That being said, if Java does actually care about the obviously explicit 'super-class overload', what's Monkey's argument against this? Confusion? Hardly, the point of the other overload is to be explicit in the first place, and it's not like you can't just call 'ToBlah' anyway. The difference between the argument to do an unnecessary cast to your super-class versus calling 'ToBlah' is that 'ToBlah' is not always relevant (And 'ToBlah' acting like a language-construct to begin with), not to mention that casting to your super-class is counter-intuitive. Monkey can have it's differences, I'm completely for that without a doubt, but that doesn't mean there shouldn't be real reasoning behind the language's choices and designs. The point I'm trying to make is that Monkey can be like Java in many ways, but there should be nothing saying it should follow everything Java does exactly. Just as we should only follow Java if a valid argument is made.<br><br>What needs to be addressed is that primitives are being treated as valid super-classes internally. 'ToBlah' itself is a weird, but reasonably integrated (Method-wise), language construct. It technically doesn't even belong in 'ExtendsType', and that's exactly the problem in the first place; 'ExtendsType' uses 'ToBlah' as a fall-back when it really shouldn't. Those overloads are only ambiguous to 'Trans' because of the specific way 'ToBlah' was hacked in. Again, I'm not saying it shouldn't be there, but some of the code should probably be moved around in 'Trans' so this isn't even an issue. Either that, or we could just use my lazy hack for the time being.<br><br>So wait a minute, this has happened many times, you say? Gee, I wonder if that's because choosing the legitimate super-class is the logical decision. And Mark saying the decision was to let it continue to cause errors about illegitimate ambiguity, because? What's worse about this is that the language teaches you in every other situation that fitting in your super-class's shoes is a good design choice. But all of the sudden overloads come in and it's magically not the best choice? I call shenanigans on that one.<br><br>The argument for having to cast to your parent/super type is like saying you should cast to the exact derived type an object actually is every time you use it. It's an anti-virtual way of thinking, and it's quite frankly a bad choice to me.<br><br>And as I said before, I know it's Mark's decision, but that doesn't mean I shouldn't try to change his mind.<br><br>To make a long story short, however, I seem to be in agreement with you, even if your post confused me initially.<br><br><b>EDIT: I should state that my stance of this has changed a bit. Mark's right, this isn't a bug, but that doesn't mean it's not an issue.</b> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It isn't "Java does this, so Monkey should too". At most it's "You cribbed this from Java so perhaps you should have made use of the time and effort those designers put into figuring out how the feature fits into the language overall", but primarily it's "This feature doesn't deliver what it's meant to the way it currently works in Monkey".<br><br>My argument about the value of putting energy into persuading Mark that he's made a bad decision here is also above. The two things are entirely different points and it's probably best not to confuse the two or put words into my mouth while doing it. If you want to spend your time trying to change Mark's mind about this despite the fact that it has been argued several times over three years or so then be my guest. I'd suggest that his heels are firmly planted though. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

As long as the language doesn't creep into the territory where there's 50 million "don't use that" features, I don't see what problem there is with keeping this around.  The same could be said with sigils and things of that nature, although I think with each new iteration the language evolves past its BB roots and in the meantime it doesn't seem to be hurting anyone. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
