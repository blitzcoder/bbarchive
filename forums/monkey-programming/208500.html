While I like the level of commentary given to some of these for beginners, to more advanced users the level of commenting in a basic template (particularly the entry point file, where the majority of code will go) can become a bit of a nuisance due to the clutter.  Power users will probably end up making their own templates without these if you don't give them an option to suppress the 'extra' commentary.  This may not be a big deal for the abstract code in commandlineapp; I see that as "library" code.<br><br>2.  I love the fact you chose Game as the App singleton (this is the same convention I use for my games) in the Mojo example. However, you called its constructor in a way that I believe is disallowed by Strict -- The default ctor should probably have a set of parenthesis after the class name when it's called from Main().  I don't know this for sure, but I believe setting Strict would cause trans to complain at this line.<br><br>3.  SetUpdateRate(60) is pretty safe, standard stuff to put in OnUpdate() in a template.  How about Cls() in OnRender()?  Maybe even Cls(0,0,0) if you're catering to newbies...<br><br>4.  What's your opinion on verbose block closure statements?  I know it's not "standard Monkey" but I just wanted to get your opinion of it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

(Mojo Game, Command line tool)<br><br>2.- Any module will be able to provide its own collection of solution templates. Just adding a folder into the module (with a specific name) will make Jungle Ide show all the module available templates when a new solution wizard is run. So, JungleGui will have a set of templates. If you install the JungleGui module, you'll be ableto use them.<br><br>That opens the door to any module developer to provide a set (or a single) solution with a basic project setup to get going.<br><br>3.- Also, any module can register file templates (no solution templates, but single file templates). So, in any project, you could add a new file based on a pre-made file template.<br><br>4.- I would also (maybe not in next version) allow modules to define code snippets, so when you're editing code in a file that directly or indirectly imports a given module, you can be able to import pre-made code samples. As instance, a button creation on a Gui module, or a Tiled loader if you're using Diddy, etc... (not sure still how to make this, but it'll come).<br><br>5.- Last part of "the plan" is to create a decentralized module repository, more to come about this later. My idea is to make it using Monkey and JungleGui, but it would be faster to develop it using Java, so not sure still about this.

Typical newbie problems of having a "myclass.monkey" with a class called "myclass" and having identifier clashes problems. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

How's a beginner is supposed to know what type is OK to specify in an EachIn when trying to get an enumerator from Map&lt;K,V&gt;.Keys when the return type is "MapKeys"? Then there's the issue of Length sometimes requiring () at the end of it and sometimes not.  The error messages for these types incidents are particularly unhelpful when Trans can't point to the specific char on the line it's annoyed with..<br><br>Return types for Int functions in Main() and mojo events can be annoying, although that's just a matter of personal laziness. The only reason I can imagine using Strict for is to prevent not specifying a vartype or return type.  Sometimes people forget this defaults to Int and won't be caught in some cases at runtime if something other than an Int is assigned to it.  Undefined behavior and all that = bad.<br><br>IMHO, good coding practice in Monkey is to close your code blocks verbosely, and never use vartype sigils.  AFAIK Strict enforces neither of these, so to me, it's just a useless bit of one specific type of 'correctness pedantry'.  And unlike following "good coding practice" guidelines in templates, Strict further enforces the user to do the same, regardless of their coding style.  No sir, I don't like it.<br><br>Disclaimer:  Currently working on large codebase with major contributions from ~4 people.  Only a few modules are Strict, and this was mainly to be "extra safe" when writing the code because it couldn't go through as many testing cycles before it was required to go into production builds.  Most of our code is not written with Strict in mind, and this affords a little flexibility in the syntax, like more terse 'Enum' class members, and less guesswork on whether things like a Length field (for example) is a Field/Property or Method. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
