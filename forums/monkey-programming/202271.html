While I appreciate difficulty, I also enjoy making games which reward players for everything they put into it - think of games like Monster Hunter or Demon/Dark Souls which are considered very difficult but still can reward players. I mostly do not like the older arcade games which are both very difficult (built around the arcade quarter eating mentality)and also do not reward players much. Modern games at least try to balance fun with difficulty by scaling games toward what a player is capable or making difficulty a choice which is then rewarded - like in games which implement bullet grazing to increase score but also increase risk and require mastery of the game to be successful with. You can make a game which is painful to play, which makes people rage-quit, and caters to a select few who really enjoy having to replay the same parts of the game over and over until they finally beat it... or worse require them to restart the entire game on death... but that also limits your audience and depending on your goals limiting your audience is a very bad thing to do. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
