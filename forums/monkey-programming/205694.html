What I'm suggesting should be trivial to add.<br><br>EDIT: We would also need to be able to change the image while the game is running as you might want a different image displayed over various sections of the game.

Monkey would play no role in pausing the game.<br><br>Among other things this would allow for a pseudo pause state were you can display a menu of options for the player to choose from like what Origaming was talking about in this <a href="http://www.monkeycoder.co.nz/Community/posts.php?topic=3212#33261" target="_blank">thread</a>. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There is also a gameTime:Float that keeps running in case I want to do animations anyway, e.g. on option buttons, or if I wanted to animate the 'Paused' image.  Both get updated (or not) on every OnUpdate().<br><br>On some systems a focused-state variable might be handy - you could check that in OnUpdate() before deciding how to increment gameTime and playTime.<br><br>The timer values are an adjunct to a state value which indicates what gets drawn during OnRender().  For example, if you have an options menu showing, that should be known by reading a state variable.  In OnUpdate() you then do not increment playTime, and you read the option buttons.  And in OnRender() you draw (perhaps) the game in a faded fashion, and then draw the option buttons on top.  If the buttons flash when pressed, gameTime is still incrementing so they can tell what colour they should be. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
