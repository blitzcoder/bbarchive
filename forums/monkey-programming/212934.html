In particular:<br><br>* MonkeyX will be completely open sourced and the Monkey-X.com site will be closed.<br> <br>* Blitzbasic.com will be closed.<br><br>* The monkey2 site will remain, as will the monkey2 Patreon page.<br> <br>My plan is to continue working on monkey2, but to also enhance my income by creating things with it to be sold commercially such as an IAP module for mobile, a simple 'Maplet' style modeller for the upcoming 3d module, and hopefully even a game one of these days!<br><br>I would urge monkeyx users to switch to monkey2 if possible. It is very similar to monkeyx, and is by now just about 'feature equivalent' with it. Monkey2 does not alas generate html5 code so you'll still need MonkeyX for that, but MonkeyX will still be around.<br><br>Website closures will probably happen before the end of the month. This is definitely a bummer. BB.com in particular has a long and colorful history and is IMO still a great programming site. But the truth is BRL isn't even making enough money these days to keep the sites running. I've been hosting them on a dedicated server which is not cheap, and while I guess I could move them to a smaller, cheaper server, I think it's time to let them go. I've been coding and hosting community websites for over 10 years now and I feel like I've had enough of that for a while.<br><br>All in all, I just want to get back to hardcore coding! I've been having a great time working on monkey2 and, even if it doesn't turn out to be as popular as stuff I've done in the past, I don't really care if I can manage to make a living out of it!<br> <br></div><br><br>Thanks for everyone's support over the years! <br><br>MonkeyX will definitely still be around. It is still up at github, and available for download from blitzresearch.itch.io (need to add a linux download).<br><br>If people want, I can add a monkeyx forum to the monkey2 site (I'll probably do this anyway), but I'd really like to see monkeyx users switch to monkey2 if possible - there are some cool things coming very soon such as a new 3d module! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You mind if I backup both sites? I typically use it for downloading forums that are going away. <br></div><br><br>Aside from that, how much bandwidth and server space does it cost to run these places? I have a VPS (not as good as dedicated, but up there. I do have full control.) and would willingly host the sites for free (I know you want to let them go, but...). I host other people's websites on occasion for free, like this pixel artist (http://lolipopsicle.com/) and was hosting a hardware engineer (http://hackniac.com/). I have about 950GB of bandwidth a month that is left unused...<br><br>Edit: Or, other idea, instead of me downloading the site, just strip the user password hashes and emails, disable registration, and just release the site database and code so that it's easy to display in read-only mode outside of here. Because I'm looking at the site structure, and my tool which was designed for vBulletin forums, is going to have a little trouble since you did some strange things, like multipage threads, the last page is first. It's weird and hard to work with.<br><br>Edit: Okay, I've come up with another alternative if you don't release the database.

I'm not downloading the apps or anything, so be aware of that. Also, I kept people's websites, not emails, but I'm not sure if I should or not. Not sure how many are bot website SEO link type things. As for the BB forums, they are a beast. I wasn't able to get the worklogs in an easy way, so I decided to skip them since they didn't seem to have anything that important in them anyways. Mostly chit-chat about projects that were dropped. So, in total, the BB forums database is at about 40%. Users: 30%. Code archives at 100%. Woo~ wonder how much longer until it's done. Also, no emails. I stripped emails because I don't want spammers to grab it and spam me or anyone else. It's another reason why I think I should strip the website links from people's data. I fear it's just going to be used for either A) SEO bots who got in to get free links by Google/Bing/Other Bots, or B) Spammers looking for a list of websites to try their bot against.

All-in-all I'd say I'm socially healthy for someone with multiple mental illnesses.<br><br>Edit: Agh, it took me too long to write this response. Third point is actually 93.164313518811313602026758388579% complete<br><br>Edit to below response (as I don't want to derail further, I'm serious): GfK seems a bit confused to me. I'm afraid I don't believe in the idea of demons. I don't consider my mental illness or any way I've acted here as demons. It's me, pure and simple. I am who I am and nothing else. Also, I mainly wanted to say, 96.395846624689097852116908453765% complete now (This is nerve racking as I just want to know that it's done!)<br>---------------------------<br><br>To clarify to Blitz and Mark, I appreciate what you guys have done over the years. I honestly wouldn't have gotten into doing games if not for the simplified way it was presented to me when I was young. So I'm not doing this to be mean. I'm not intentionally wanting to cause problems. I just don't trust that I'll see results in a way that I expect with Blitz's track record. So you'll have to excuse me as I carry on. At least I'm not aimlessly acquiring files like Yue is. Yue should really stop as HTTrack doesn't know how to handle sites that use queries very well. If you have "posts.php?topic=12934" and "posts.php?topic=12934&amp;page=3", it wouldn't know that they're the same. Same with things like "posts.php?page=3&amp;topic=12934" and "posts.php?topic=12934&amp;page=3". It would download two separate files.<br><br>----------------------<br>UPDATE! UPDATE! UPDATE! I have completed it 100%! Now just wait for me to get it all structured together and I'll release it in a few days. <a href="https://join.skype.com/OD0rfhKvdLYK" target="_blank">https://join.skype.com/OD0rfhKvdLYK</a><br><br>@Xaron Looks like Germany won this one.
