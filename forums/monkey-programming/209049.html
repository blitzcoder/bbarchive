One of my requirements for a 32 bit development VM was so I could transfer my VM to a lesser laptop where I could still run the VM while travelling, that laptop had tighter memory constraints and a 64 bit guest running on it just didn't seem feasible.  That older laptop rarely gets used, but a move to a 64 bit VM would force me to purchase another laptop for travel purposes that had at least 12GB of memory to run the 64 bit host and 64 bit guest comfortably.  <br><br>It is really more the hassle of creating a new Windows 7 64 bit Guest and then replicating my entire dev environment in that.  The process involves deactivating quite a few dev tools and utilities, setting up the 64 bit Windows 7 (or maybe 8, but I would have to purchase that) for the VM, and reinstalling the lot (all my dev tools) with updates, etc... etc...

Options in the devchain would be good;  I don't mind if they're not updated as frequently, as long as they're updated from time to time (ie:  'stable' builds).   Linux and Mac users should already be on 64-bit. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
