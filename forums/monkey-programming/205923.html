So as you upgrade XCode it keeps the old SDKs. So some might have 3.x, 4.x or later.<br><br>Not sure about this...<br><br>My understanding is that 'base SDK' contains all the headers/libs your apps compiles against, while deployment target controls the 'output format' of your app's exe (so it can run on iOS vXYZ etc) and various compiler warnings/errors etc if you attempt to use stuff not supported in iOS versions&gt;deployment target.<br><br>So in general, you always use latest base SDK, and set deployment target according to your app's OS requirements. This is how I have the current iOS target setup here - base sdk is "Latest (iOS 7.0)" while deployment target is "iOS 4.3", and everything is building/running fine on 4.3 and later devices.<br><br>But perhaps older SDKs are required for older deployment targets for some reason? Seems unlikely to me, but who knows...?<br><br>Is anyone with xcode5 NOT able to set their deployment target to 4.3? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Both work fine in iOS7. The only thing I did differently was including PNGs for new icon sizes in the package (manually, since the old XCode doesn't know anything about new icon requirements).<br><br>Then I did a stupid thing - upgraded my testing device to iOS7. Now I have to upgrade both XCode and OS X. Bummer :(<br><br>Off-topic: nice to see I am not the only one still using Monkey 66b.

Including the icons manually anyway was an interesting leap of faith, do they work on iOS7 OK then?  So now you've upgraded to iOS7 and need to upgrade XCode I guess you probably should upgrade 66b as the latest one uses the correct lowest SDK of 4.3 right? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

They accepted it, however I received an automated e-mail informing me that the app package didn't have icons for iOS7. The app looks normal in iOS7 - the icon was borderless, so the new corner "radius" was not an issue. The OS just takes closest icon by size and resizes it to fit iOS7 requirements.<br><br>I included iOS7 icons in the second app (just by adding needed PNGs and referencing them in the corresponding array in plist). There was no e-mail and the app got accepted (submitted before but accepted after iOS7 launch date).<br><br>As far as 66b goes, I hope I can still use it if I manually change SDK version in XCode.
