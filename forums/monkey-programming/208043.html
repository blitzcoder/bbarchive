Basically the Compare method wants a value associated with each key to work. I can use whatever number I want, not necessarily the value actually stored by the map for the given key.

Method Compare(a:Unit, b:Unit)

In your case you want to use your Unit instances as keys. That's fine but you need to understand some requirements/properties of Monkey's maps/keys.<br><br>* Key-value pairs are considered unique. Only one value can be stored against one key.<br>* Keys are required to be orderable and the compare method must reveal that order through its return value.<br><br>So, as I said above, your first problem was that you created Unit with an integer field "foo", wrote a compare method for it and then didn't ever set the value of foo so it was zero for every instance. This meant that when you wrote "Map.Set(New Unit(), Rnd(1000))" as far as the Map was concerned you were giving it the same key every time. The result is that you just replaced the value stored against that key resulting in what you saw as three values being added and only one being found in the loop. There is no problem there with the "EachIn", you actually only have one value in the Map.<br><br>What may be throwing you is that languages like Java offer map/dictionary implementations where all objects can inherently be used as keys. Unfortunately Monkey's base Object doesn't have this property. The code did at one point have commented out stubs for Equals and (I think) HashCode methods that would have allowed this but they were never implemented. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

You're using foo as the ordering value for your Unit instance in compare so you've chosen it as the key. Your Compare method defines the key ordering. Monkey knows nothing about the nature of your key objects which is the very reason you have to write a compare method. When you add a key-value or try to retrieve a value by the key the Map internally calls the compare function to test against the keys it has stored.<br><br>If your compare function looks at the foo values and they're both zero then as far as the Map is concerned it's the same key. It looks at the first key, calls the compare method and the compare method says "They're the same". You could add a million entries with new Unit instances and you're just replacing the same entry. On the other hand if you do the same with this:<br><br><pre class=code>
Class UnitMap&lt;V&gt; Extends Map&lt;Unit, V&gt;
	Method Compare(a:Unit, b:Unit)
		Return 1 ' if you change this with 1 or -1 the code works as expected
	End
End
</pre><br><br>Then compare method is effectively saying "No matter what Unit instances you give me, they are always different". You could pass the exact same Unit instance in for both a and b and it would say they are different. This means that every new Unit is a different key and you get as many entries as times you call Set but it also means that when you try to retrieve a value the Map calls compare and gets told "It's lower" or "It's higher" every time and therefore never finds a match. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

My initial code was broken because I was comparing the foo fields of the objects, which were all set to zero. I decided to use the foo field in the compare method and that was obviously not what I wanted to do. The problem still persists though: I don't want to use an object field for the comparison (I didn't want to use foo for that matter), I already have the unique object reference and that should be enough, so it's the object reference value I want to compare, how can I achieve this?<br><br><pre class=code>
