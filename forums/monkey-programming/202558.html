Or...<br><br>XNA on Windows 8 can only produce WP7/XBOX apps, not desktop/metro/tablet apps? Or...<br><br>XNA on Windows 8 can only produce desktop apps, not metro apps? Or..<br><br>XNA on Windows 8 can only produce desktop/x86 apps, not metro/arm/tablet apps?<br><br>At the very least, GLFW apps run on Windows 8 and I'll be making sure that remains a viable fallback for starters. <br><br>Beyond that, it really depends on how things pan out - ie: will the metro thing take off? Or, more precisely, will tablets that can only run metro take off? If so, and a whole new target is required to achieve this, then I'm in.<br><br>But if not, and Windows 8 ends up being primarily a desktop with a freakin' hugely annoying start menu (my pick), and depending on what exactly 'no XNA on Windows 8' means, then...?<br><br>I'll do more research, but the current situation is IMO very confusing!<br><br>&gt; I don't understand why they would kill XNA after all of the effort and great feedback. It definitely makes no sense at all. <br><br>Same here - best thing they ever come up with and they seem determined to shoot it in the head!<br><br>It's really hard to work out what they're thinking - if they want metro on tablets to take off, surely it makes sense to leverage existing/future WP7/XBOX apps/games? Would the iPad have done as well if iPhone devs hadn't been able to easily convert existing apps? <br><br>I guess the other issue is whether or not windows 8 metro apps can be built for WP7? If so (surely!) then using DX for both metro and WP7 might make sense. But don't you need to be a well heeled uber-developer to be 'allowed' to use DX on WP7? If so, are they *really* expecting indie devs to write everything twice - once for WP7 in XNA, once for metro in DX?!? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

WinRT is a re-design of the entire low-level systems used in Windows 8 allowing everything from C#/VB.Net to HTML5/CSS/Javascript and C++ to be used for Metro apps.  For game specific apps, I feel that the DX platform will offer a better experience over HTML5.<br><br>Personally I feel they may (eventually) provide a wrapper or some sort of upgrade path for XNA as there is a lot of grief around this decision currently.  <br><br>Also we still don't know where WP8 is going to sit in all of this - rumors suggest this will also be based on W8.  I think this will be the first step to a new combined experience going forward - Windows powering desktops/laptops/tablets/phones/xbox with a consistant development environment for all.<br><br>Putting some context around Windows 8 and the Metro platform, in just over 2 years Windows 7 has sold over 550 mil copies.  Even assuming a smaller turnover to W8 you are looking at hundreds of millions of users plus a reasonable % on (ARM) tablets who will only have the W8 store to purchase from. Microsoft have already said they are going all out for their store to succeed (as it has for Apple).  I feel the potential for W8 will not be clear until there are tablets around for people to get a real feel for the OS.<br><br><div class="quote"> If so, are they *really* expecting indie devs to write everything twice - once for WP7 in XNA, once for metro in DX?!? <br> <br></div><br>I guess (for us at least) this is the power of the Monkey platform - the potential pain is for Mark (or someone else) to decide to write a target to support it.  Getting in early to support W8 metro may also be of benefit to Monkey itself - if it is more difficult to develop for then Monkey as a cross-platform tool is in the ball-game.<br><br>It's just a pity that as open as Microsoft has been in the past they are now being very closed about their future. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I have developed a business app with WinForms - all 3rd party components are now (finally) moving up to WPF but its not clear as to how long this (and Silverlight) are going to continue. I guess the same situation has arisen for XNA.<br><br>As I said above, my guess is that WinRT will be the new focus across all platforms.  Stuff like WinForms, WPF/Silverlight and XNA will remain for backward compatibility only on the desktop - perhaps a new sub-set of WinRT for the desktop may eventually come to replace these.<br><br>I do think this could be a great opportunity for Monkey though. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
