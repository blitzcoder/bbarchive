I mean a system like "plugins". I think about a Ogre3D target because i work (again) on the B+/B3D/BMax engine, but i can't do that for Monkey. Because Monkey doesn't support external libs. We have Ogre3D for Windows, Linux, Mac, iOS and partially for Android ... i think it would be a great thing to have Ogre for Monkey, as a target or (better) as a module. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

That's the main selling point of cross-platform languages after all.<br><br>While I'm sure there would have been problems to deal with, I doubt that wrapping the original box2d would have been more difficult than porting. I imagine the opposite in fact. What would cost a lot of effort would be to bring all the "native" port interfaces into line and keep them that way over time. Unless you do that, you're stuck with a module that only works on a sub-set of targets and that's hardly worth much in the Monkey world. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The trick is to declare your external functions with "Extern Class Extends Null" to keep the GC from collecting, but then you have to manually free memory. **BUT** since monkey has no OnExit() in the App Class, how are we to do this? I must say, though, there are tricks to allow monkey to keep and manage the c++ object itself, but this would be a different topic.<br><br>Also, trans.exe or the project files would require some adjustments to allow linking to external libs, for both MacOS and PC (which I can do with mingw easily).<br><br>I may try to investigate this further (wxMonkey?), but for now it's not so cut and dry. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
