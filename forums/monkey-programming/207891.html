The way lookups are performed on a Map is a red-black tree binary search operation.  One big map means that the data is ordered the way the data structure wants it to be for fastest access.  By splitting the data up into multiple smaller Maps, what you're doing is essentially forcing multiple lookups.<br><br>Insertion to a Map has the same cost as pulling from a map, because of the way a Map is organized.  That cost is O(log n).  So maybe you're speeding up the insertion time by using multiple smaller maps, but why would you want to do that? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I would expect them to always perform within a constant factor of each other. Think about it in terms of asymptotics: You're adding a constant factor (lets call it 'm') which is the number of maps. Each map has exactly n/m items in it (here n is the total number of items added to all maps). Hence your lookup is tightly bounded O(lg m + lg n/m), removing all constant factors trivially reduces to O(lg n). Insertion is no different. It only seems better because in this synthetic example you are removing the lg m lookup (still a constant factor mind you), since you create groups with complete foreknowledge of the contents--you never need to 'find' which map to insert into.<br><br>Remember that if you really need to shave off a few milliseconds, you could try using a Hashtable for large maps. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

What you're seeing isn't about the maps. You're seeing the effects of other decisions. Primarily I think you're seeing the impact of the way you've defined your keys. Your keys are strings, formatted like this:<br><br>"group_"+groupIndex<br>"item_"+itemIndex<br><br>The first thing to point out is that if you insist on using string keys you'd see a far greater performance boost than your splitting is getting you simply by ensuring that the bit that is different is at the front: groupIndex+"_group" is going to be much faster in comparison than what you have. Using an Int is going to be much faster again and if you need speed then forgoing human readable keys for numbers should be the first choice. <br><br>The second thing is that if you create a string with numbers from 0 to 10 they are going to have fewer characters on average than strings using numbers from 0 to 10000. By splitting your maps you're also reducing the length of the keys. This makes the comparisons generally faster too. <br><br>You also introduce a layer of caching for your group lookup, which is a legitimate possibility with the split scheme (although probably of minor benefit), but doesn't make for a straight comparison.<br><br>I took your code, changed the keys to ints and set up 100,000 items in 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10,000 and 100,000 groups, removed the caching bit and then ran the test 10 times and took the average fetch times:<br><br>Here's a normal HTML5 (chrome) run:<br><br>Avg for 1 groups: 101.4<br>Avg for 10 groups: 113.6<br>Avg for 100 groups: 113.4<br>Avg for 1000 groups: 119.5<br>Avg for 10000 groups: 103.3<br>Avg for 100000 groups: 136.6<br><br>Flash:<br><br>Avg for 1 groups: 217.3<br>Avg for 10 groups: 250.5<br>Avg for 100 groups: 227.8<br>Avg for 1000 groups: 259.5<br>Avg for 10000 groups: 244.5<br>Avg for 100000 groups: 279.8<br><br>GLFW:<br><br>Avg for 1 groups: 62.100000000000001<br>Avg for 10 groups: 57.700000000000003<br>Avg for 100 groups: 62.399999999999999<br>Avg for 1000 groups: 72.200000000000003<br>Avg for 10000 groups: 79.099999999999994<br>Avg for 100000 groups: 87.400000000000006<br><br><br>I doubt the other platforms are much different. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Any map will take longer to search the larger the population of elements. The point made above isn't that smaller maps aren't faster it's that splitting the search space across multiple maps stored in another map isn't going to be faster. I'm not sure I see the value in creating a generalised caching class to be extended rather than just adding a suitable map to classes that need it but if you're doing it then a separate cache per class is the way to go. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Splay sort can give you almost transcendental performance on any kind of partially ordered data, and when I say ordered, I don't mean sorted. 1, 99, 2, 98... etc can be sorted in guaranteed O(n) by Splay sort! They are great for database, or anything needing to cache regularly accessed items. Splay trees, however, are NOT good for real time applications because they are amortized data structures in the truest sense. This means that over any number of insertions or queries, they will always average O(lg n). However, a single query can take up too O(n). Not great if you don't want to drop frames every now and again. This is not a matter of chance or luck. Splay trees will ALWAYS have O(n) look-ups or insertions, and thus your game will ALWAYS have latency spikes. If you want to use one while loading, however, I'd say its a great idea. I just wouldn't use one in my main loop.<br><br>For look-ups in your main loop Monkey's Map is great. It may be a bit slow, but it always performs consistently. and predictably..Having a constant but lower framerate looks better than having a high but variable one. Hashmaps can perform much faster, and indeed do not get slower as you add more and more items (they always average O(1) look-ups). They have a nasty risk in their probabilistic underpinnings though. It is possible to get slow O(n) look-ups if you aren't careful with your hash functions.<br><br>If you are doing only String look ups, I think you might find that a radix trie will handily beat pretty much anything, unless you have a very optimized Hashtable implementation (which incidentally isn't possible in monkey due to its high level nature).<br><br>Just my 2 'cents'. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Real world radix tree performance, for example, won't be enormously different to the existing StringMap implementation as long as you don't create a load of keys that have a common prefix (like you did, ahem). Many of the more esoteric data structures are esoteric for a reason and the academic CS concept of algorithmic efficiency doesn't necessarily translate to actual measured implementation speed.<br><br>@maltic: What you say about the potential for splay trees to have performance spikes is true, however it's not true that it's inevitable that you'll get an n-depth tree at some point. The shape of the tree depends on the access pattern. If your accesses are mostly hitting the same items (which is why you'd use it) then it may never happen. It occurs if you run through the data in an ordered manner. I'd also suggest that for a tree of a size used in a game it's probably unlikely that an occasional linear search would be much of a big deal anyway, which is a two-edged sword as it also brings into question whether you'd even notice the benefit from the splay tree working well in the first place. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I dissembled slightly (but in the best interest of the game programmer) when I talked about Splay trees. Let me elaborate: you are guaranteed to see that O(n) performance splay operation  IFF (if and only if) you access every element in the Splay Tree. The use of a magic potential function in the amortized proof by Sleator and Tarjan implies this. Basically for the math to work out, and the cost of k splays to be O(k lg n), you need a linear time splay in there. The order doesn't matter, since nothing happens to a Splay Tree between queries anyway, so any access pattern is sequential.<br><br>However, as muddy_shoes says, I don't think there is any point trying to find a perfect Map. You might see a slight improvement from a Radix Trie or a Hashmap. But at the sizes used in your regular game atlas, we're talking about microseconds. May as well spend your time making something Monkey really needs (you've already made some excellent Modules, some of which I use regularly!), than shaving a few microseconds off an already competent built-in data structure. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
