This gives the module admin no way of controlling public releases except by working in a dev branch.

More significantly there's no way to flag dependencies. <br><br>I appreciate that there's a certain convenience to just wrapping repository functions but the above are all reasons why most package managers work via other mechanisms.

It is up to the module authors &amp; admins to verify a framework works each monkey release and "update" the version number if they so desire. The idea is not to ensure every mod is always updated, but so that users can make wiser selections if modules go out-of-date because of monkey api updates.<br><br>How to add/update mods?<br>I guess the best would be to use the website's account system for this.

People want automation but at the same time that implies that the work of combing through the modules and keeping up to date listings of them isn't simply passed off to either:  1. the module maintainer  or 2. the module list maintainer.  The arguments seem to stem over a few things, like ease of use, but I think the elephant in the room may simply be that some people aren't used to (or ready) to accept a version control system like Git into their lives yet.<br><br>Personally, I just put all of the projects I look for updates for on my Star list and haven't looked back.  Most people's projects probably <i>do not need</i> automatically updating their modules, especially considering that even with stable branches, there's a chance that method signatures have changed. I think maybe some people just want the illusion of convenience.  A central repository for most Monkey modules already kinda exists, and it's Github.  Star your favorite modules, and if you are ready to update one of them (ie:  you're ready to refactor your code, or you don't have any code that will break by getting the update), then check out the page for the latest.<br><br>Really, the best compromise for all of this has already been solved by other sufficiently mature code-sharing communities, long long ago.  You have a package manager which is updated manually or invoked automatically from time to time to inform of the latest modules.  Either we put the modules' code in packages directly to a master repo, or the master repo serves as the place pointing to where each module's central repo lives.  The package manager is informed which types of updates are acceptable for the end-user to be presented with as "The latest" -- Stable (release), Unstable (latest), or backports to a specific version.  <br><br>What we use as the back-end to host these repos is only as significant as it is to maintain the hosting itself.  Making our own version control systems in the name of 'convenience' seems a bit backward compared to the relatively minimal effort it would take to adapt an existing one (<i>ahem,</i> like Git!) to this sort of scheme. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I'm fine if it uses GitHub repos to do the lifting, but not sure that is easier or simpler in any sense, I expect that complicates things.

The fourth that gitHub does provide is the author's ability to push changes and I am mentioning that since it is probably useful to think twice before we exclude that and replace it with a person that acts as a "ModuleManager".<br><br>And if my post above came across as we need to make a version control system, then that was not my intention at all.
