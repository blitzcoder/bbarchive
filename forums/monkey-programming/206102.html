Just to add, the error reported by Monkey is line 94, which is in Class2's New() method at:<pre class=code>Self.image = mainClass.class1.baseImage</pre> which is called before the "New Class2" call so should be loaded and thus a valid image?<br><br>Sorry for the ramble. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I don't know!<br><br>At the beginning of my "monkey time" I was very careful and did'nt allow me a lot of things, which are technical possible.<br><br>Nowadays I code more radical with wild constructions and all variants, that are possible.<br><br>I think, as long as you do not have performance problems you need not think about the best of 10 ways. Just do it. As long as you do not work with thousands of objects but only some dozent, you will not get any performance problems.<br><br>And if you get performnce problems you will have to start to examine all 10 ways to find out, what is the best on which target.<br><br>for mother-related operations like your example "accesing a field in class 2 whilst in Class 3" I would do it this way:<br><br><pre class=code>Class2
   Field X%, Y%, bla:Class3
     Method blabla()
          ....
          bla:Class3= New Class3
          Class3.Mother=Self
     .....
End

[code]Class3
   Field Mother:Class2
     Method Draw()
          ....
          DrawText "hello", Mother.X, Mother.Y

If it gets in the way, remember YOU are the boss.  [The machines will take over soon enough, so enjoy it while you can, puny human.]<br><br>Organise things the way that makes sense to you.  Flexible OO languages like Monkey (and most of its targets) support a lot of ways of doing things, so if the language is getting in the way, there is probably a way of doing what you want that can be expressed nicely in the language too.<br><br>All the things you want to do are fine in context except you are scattering image references around between classes a little more promiscuously than I would like.  For example, I would never give a dot in Pacman its own image, unless it's a super-dot that has all sorts of individual animations.  I would have a game window class that draws all the dots.  That said, you are using an engine and maybe that is pushing you in certain ways.  And you can, of course, have the dot draw itself if that's what you want anyway. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
