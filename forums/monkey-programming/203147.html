When someone press F1, the IDE will look for documentation in a cascade way, so it will display the first available documentation in any of the provided systems. It would be great if Ted can also look for documentation created using Jungle in its browser. It should be altra easy, all pages are in a module subfolder called .docs, and all you have to do is reference the file:<br>[modulelocation].docs/modulename.monkey.html#ItemName<br><br>As an exmample, this shows documentation for the class BitMapChar in my computer:<br>file:///C:/Monkey%20Compiler/MonkeyPro60/modules/fontmachine/.docs/bitmapchar.monkey.html#BitMapChar<br><br>And this shows documentation for the method LoadCharImage:<br>file:///C:/Monkey%20Compiler/MonkeyPro60/modules/fontmachine/.docs/bitmapchar.monkey.html#LoadCharImage<br><br>You can also add the sourcecode linenumber of the identifier declaration:<br>file:///C:/Monkey%20Compiler/MonkeyPro60/modules/fontmachine/.docs/bitmapchar.monkey.html#<b>28</b>LoadCharImage<br>This way you can avoid name clashes on overloading, or several classes defining the same methods on the same document.

Only improvement I'd like to see is not needing to write "summary:" before my comments - would also make it much easier to create docs from code that was created without the thought of a specific doc-system.

I don't mean this as an insult, just that it's in an early stage and missing features such as Taiphoz has mentioned above.  The integration with Jungle is quite good, but the exported html docs are quite basic, though improved by "borrowing" the frameset code from Taiphoz ;)<br><br>I started looking at using doxygen as a potential alternative, at least until Ziggy's docs had some of the extra functionality.  At first, it didn't seem viable as it only supports C-style languages unless you write a filter for it.  Then I considered that the trans does exactly what the doxygen filters are supposed to do: convert code from one format into another.<br><br>Ok, so I'm nowhere near that stage yet, but I translated some files by hand so they were kinda C-style, so I could see what it would potentially look like.  The results of my test can be seen at <a href="http://kaldev-games.co.uk/helix/," target="_blank">http://kaldev-games.co.uk/helix/,</a> which IMHO looks quite useful, albeit a bit of a pain if it has to be hand-translated each time.  I'm considering delving into the trans code to see if it's feasible to create a "doxygen" target that'll do all this automagically, but I really don't have a clue what awaits me :P<br><br>I know this style of documentation may not suit everyone here, but I thought I'd share my findings just in case.  If others are interested, I'm more likely to look at creating a doxygen target and sharing it.  If I'm the only one who cares, it's probably best I stick with hand-translating. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

They will be improved soon-ish But I have the idea of keeping them simple and easy to use. My first idea is that you could provide a "documentation.txt" page on any project that can contain directives on how you want to organize the documents index, so when you build documentation for that project, the idex is also created. I think with this it'll be enough. I plan to support bcodes on this index page, so it can be customized. But I'm still "designing" all this so it may end being different. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
