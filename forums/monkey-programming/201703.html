More info here: <a href="http://www.jungleide.com" target="_blank">http://www.jungleide.com</a><br><br>(continued <a href="http://www.monkeycoder.co.nz/Community/posts.php?topic=1125" target="_blank">from here</a>)<br>Notes on the new update:<br><br>This new Jungle Ide iteration comes with a complete “Connections” system that provides a better management of child processes in you coding session.<br> <br>A connection is a GUI based system that allows you to manage any external program being run by Jungle Ide, like the Monkey compiler, when you’re compiling source code.<br> <br>This new system lets you monitor the external programs status (process) and abort their execution at any time, in a clean and resource leak free way.<br> <br>All in all, to summarize how it works, you should understand connections this way:<br> <br>The connections system displays any running sub-process (ie. a compilation &amp; run process) in a separated TAB in the console panel. This simple addition involves some very nice features (both in low level efficiency and in usability):<br><br> •This new system lets you monitor when a process execution has ended. (no need to Ctrl+Del any more)<br><br> •This new system prevents the Jungle Ide console to get mixed contents (compilation results contents with Jungle Ide usage information, etc.)<br><br>The most important thing: This new system provides a drastically improved process management system that allows process interruption at any time granting that any child process is also detected and collected and all resources from any process and sub-process in the same branch are properly released.<br> <br>In other words, the Connections engine integrates a tree-based process identification system that allows any running application, as instance a XNA or GLFW application, to be closed properly. When you do this, Jungle will be closing also any child process that the application may have started.<br> <br>As instance, with this new and improved connections approach, when you cancel execution of a XNA Monkey game, you’ll see how the connection closes:<br> •The Trans tool<br> •The cmd shell tool used by trans to launch the running application<br> •The MonkeyGame XNA application being run<br> •The XNA game proxy engine being automatically started by the game.<br> <br>This provides a clean way to manage this resources which is much more effective and clean than just deleting the MonkeyGame child process from program manager.<br> <br>Additionally, if the application being run does itself start secondary processes, they will be automatically detected and destroyed whenever the “connection” is killed.<br> <br>Apart from this, this is the complete changelog of this new version:<br><br><div class="quote"> <br><b>Jungle Ide 11.10.04-A </b><br><br>[*]  Implemented a new bug report system that does not require the IDE user to provide a valid email address in order for us to contact him or she. This new system uses part of the license information to identify the bug report user, in case we need to contact him or she to provide a quick fix. (sending bug reports is optional, as always).<br><br>[*]  Integrated a new Connections based build system. This new system allows parallel execution of several compiler instances and also provides an efficient mechanism to develop solutions that contains modules and sample applications.<br><br>[*]  Added a new "bypass" build mode, specially designed for modules in solutions. Projects with a "bypass" build mode won't be compiled as standalone, only saved to disk so they're ready to be imported by other projects in the same solution.<br><br>[*]  Made some small speed optimizations to the Monkey modules database builder<br><br>[*]  "Build and Run" on a solution now builds all projects in the solution. If a project does not have to be built, you can set it to the new "bypass" build mode.<br><br>[*]  Added a new text renderer to the console. This new text renderer uses different text colors to differentiate warnings and errors from regular console text.<br><br>[*]  Added a "Refresh" button to the solution explorer so any changes in the folder structure can be loaded into Jungle Ide.<br><br>[*]  Fixed an issue that could generate an "out of memory" error or crash after a find and replace operation on very big solutions<br><br>[*]  Fixed an issue that could generate a hard crash on a replace operation.<br><br>[*]  Fixed an issue that was making the document generator get confused with &lt; and &gt; symbols on class definitions<br><br>[*]  Fixed an issue that could crash Jungle Ide when getting the list of recent document or solutions, when there was concurrent access to the serialized file in several Jungle Ide instances.<br><br>[*]  Fixed an issue tha could potentially make Jungle Ide fail to compile a project when the entry point of that project was renamed.<br> <br></div> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Whenever a breaking change is added to the official Monkey compiler, we'll add the change to the background compiler too. That said, keep in mind that our background compiler is not used to generate final compilation, when you press F5, Jungle Ide will use whatever compiler there is in your monkey Bin folder. So compilation (real compilation) will still be like it is now. But when you make a change in the source code window, Jungle will call its own background compiler to get any source code error. They are two separete processes. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's not that simple. I wish it could! Anyway, there is a chance that it won't need much recompilation, and maintenance should be quite simple, as there are just some small bits of the official trans modified, and they are properly identified as such. I've already made a version from Monkey 50 to Monkey 51 in less than one hour of work. And, additionally, this kind of changes will only be needed when there are changes in the official compiler that do modify Monkey syntax, wich won't happen very often.<br><br>And to the opening the trans. It will be done, but it will require some changes to official modules, so we'll see how I do open it. I supose that putting the modified modules in the same folder as the trans source code should prevent the compiler from using the modules in the modules folder. I'll investigate it before opening it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This was making the local shortcuts tree throw an unhandled exception after a specific history of hide/show nodes<br><br>[*]  Fixed a visualization problem in the preferences dialog<br><br>[*]  Added a new system that should detect file changes from outside the IDE.<br><br>[*]  Fixed an issue that was clearing the clipboard contents when Ctrl+C was pressed and there was no selection in the source code window<br><br><b>Important Breaking Change:</b><br>The new background compiler system, in order to operate, will add a new tool called junglembc in your Monkey BIN folder. (junglembc means Jungle Monkey Background Compiler)<br><br>This utility is a small executable that contains the background compiler itself. You don't have to make anything special for this tool to get copied and installed in the right folder. Jungle Ide will do this for you. It's just a modified version of the Trans Monkey Compiler used to allow Jungle Ide perform background compilation and provide feedback on syntax/lexing errors in your source code. <br><br>Current version covers syntax for Monkey V51. This tool will self-update when needed using the regular Jungle Ide update system.<br><br><b>Notes on this version:</b><br>The new background compiler service can take a bit of CPU time, on single core machines, it can be a good idea to disable it if you experience important slowdowns on Jungle Ide performance. It's been tested to work wonderfully well on a Quad Core machine on very large solutions, and also tested on a core-solo machine with large solutions and it worked perfectly well.<br> <br></div><br><br>This update is available for Jungle Ide users due regular updates system. It'll be available too for Jungle Lite, but the background compiler system is not included in Jungle Lite. It is a Jungle Ide "Pro" feature. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

There was an issue that was making the background compiler to stop responding when there were several concurrent I/O requests.<br><br>•Fixed an issue that could make Jungle Ide crash when a file that had been already renamed in disk was renamed in the solution explorer.<br><br>•Background compilation now takes less resources and is a bit faster.<br><br>•Modified the comment and uncomment selection icons, so they do not look like indenting, unindenting icons.<br><br>•Implemented a shortcut (Ctrl+D) that allows the duplication of current line of source code in any language.<br><br>•Added a way to customize matching braces highlighting. Current modes are: Box, Bold and Nothing<br><br>•Jump to definition has better understanding of data type and data instances when processing Jump to definition request.<br><br>•Fixed a serious problem with solutions layout serialization that could cause some issues on non synchronized solutions.<br><br>•<b>BREAKING CHANGE</b>: Created a separated document for project session options (opened documents, cursor pos, etc.), so project are much version control friendly and easier to merge on SVN, Github, etc. This system is backwards compatible with older Jungle Ide versions. To be good, exclude JIPO files from your repositories.<br><br>•Fixed an issue that was making Jungle Ide convert a document to a panel if there was a single stand-alone document loaded in the session, and a solution without any open document was restoring an empty layout.<br><br>•Modified Parameter Hint Pop-up does not appear when cursoring around with the Up and Down cursor keys.<br><br>•Jungle Ide load time has been slightly optimized<br><br>•Jungle Ide now defaults the internal Monkey documentation to the on online version, but this is configurable on the preferences dialog.<br><br>•New feature: If the user makes a double click on a compilation error line, in the connections output window, Jungle Ide will bring the offending source code file and document location to the front of the IDE.<br><br>•Added a new feature that allows the generation of documentation for a whole solution, at once.<br><br>•Added a setting that will allow users to define a custom color to highlight matching braces.<br><br>•Small margin improvement on the generated CSS for automatically generated documentation.<br><br>•Now Jungle Ide can store expanded/collapsed status for folders in a project solution explorer, using the separated JIPO file (that can be excluded from any version control system)<br> <br></div><br><br>Jungle Lite to be updated soon too.<br><br>EDIT: Anyone using a self-modified version of the background compiler should dowload latest official source code version from the Jungle Ide site, here: <a href="http://www.jungleide.com/?page_id=579" target="_blank">http://www.jungleide.com/?page_id=579</a> As there have been several important changes in the I/O sort-of protocol between Jungle Ide and the compiler itself. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This tool allow module developers to provide an automatic update availability notification system for Jungle Ide users. this system will inform your module users when there is a new version of the module available, and will allow them to automatically update to latest version with easy.<br><br>This system works in the following way:<br><br>Any “updatable” module will integrate a module signature file (lbms) that has information about current module update and information about where in the Internet to check for the availability of additional updates. So, when Jungle Ide finds that an installed  module update has a lmbs signature, it can then look in the Internet to see if current version is the latest available one and, if it is not, it can provide an automated download mechanism that automatically updates the module to the latest version.<br><br>To do so, a Lemon Bytes Module Signature file (lbms) has the following information:<br>• Name: The name of the module in the current update. As instance: FontMachine<br>• Version: The version number of current update.<br>• Update URL: The location where this speciffic update version can be found in the Internet. This allows this system to “repair” the module in case the module user breaks it by mistake or disk failure. The system will be able to use this information to locate this version in the Internet and download it again replacing the broken installation.<br>• Short description: This information describes briefly the changes introduced in this update of the module.<br>• More info URL: This is an Internet location where more general information regarding the module and the current update can be found. This will usually be the official module website on the net.<br><br>Additionally, this module update signature file will contain this information:<br><br>• Remote signature URL: This is an URL where the module signature of latest module version can be found. This location has to be the same for all updates of the same module. The idea is that Jungle Ide will use this URL as a “function” that returns information about latest available version. At the end, Jungle Ide will be able to compare the local version information, with the one in the Remote Signature URL to determine wether an update operation should be performed or not.<br><br>In other words, Jungle Ide will be able to download the lmbs available on the remote signature URL and compare it with the current local lmbs file and determine if versions are not the same. It is very important that all the module signtarues for every update of the same module share the same RemoteSignatureURL value. That grants access to latest available version of the module. Otherwise the module update process could not work properly.<br><br>So all in all, in pseudo code:<br><pre class=code>RemoteSignature = DownloadSignature (LocalSignature.RemoteSignatureURL)
If LocalSignature.Version = RemoteSignature.Version Then
  No Updates Available
ElseIf LocalSignature.Version &lt;&gt; RemoteSignature.Version Then
   NewUpdate = DownloadUpdate (RemoteSignature.UpdateURL)
   PerformUpdate (LocalOutdatedModule, NewUpdate)
End</pre><br><br>Now, if you want to add this functionality to your own module, you can have a detailed step-by-step guide here: <a href="http://www.jungleide.com/?p=663" target="_blank">http://www.jungleide.com/?p=663</a><br><br><br>Now I'm coping &amp; pasting the information on the step-by-step way to implement this on your own module:<br><br><b>1 How to deliver automatic updates for your module</b><br><br>Jungle Ide provides a way for module developers to automatically allow module users to get latest available version. This system does notify your module users when an update is available, giving them the option to automatically update it. Jungle Ide will take care of backing up previous module version, download the latest version ZIP module and install it on the user hard drive.<br><br>As a module developer, there’s very little to do in order for your module to be automatically handled by Jungle Ide:<br><br><b>First Step. Create a Module signature file</b><br><br>You’ll need to create a module signature file. A module signature file is a xml document in plain text, with extension lmbs (lemonbytes module basic signature). This file is used by Jungle Ide to determine whether a module has to be updated or not. This file also contains information about where to get the downloads etc. It’s very easy to set up, all you need to do is to create a plain document text file (notepad will do the job) and fill it with the following structure.<br><br>This document has to contain the following information:<br><br><div class="quote"> &lt;?xml version=”1.0&amp;#8243;?&gt;<br>  &lt;ModSignature xmlns:xsi=”http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance” xmlns:xsd=”http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema”&gt;<br>  &lt;Name&gt;<b>module display name</b>&lt;/Name&gt;<br>  &lt;MajorVersion&gt;<b>Major version number</b>&lt;/MajorVersion&gt;<br>  &lt;MinorVersion&gt;<b>Minor version number</b>&lt;/MinorVersion&gt;<br>  &lt;Revision&gt;<b>Revision</b>&lt;/Revision&gt;<br>  &lt;Build&gt;<b>Build</b>&lt;/Build&gt;<br>  &lt;Kind&gt;<b>ZipFolder</b>&lt;/Kind&gt;<br>  &lt;UpdateURL&gt;<b>update location in internet</b>&lt;/UpdateURL&gt;<br>  &lt;RemoteSignatureURL&gt;<b>remote signature location in internet</b>&lt;/RemoteSignatureURL&gt;<br>  &lt;ShortDescription&gt;<b>Description of this latest version</b>&lt;/ShortDescription&gt;<br>  &lt;RequireCredentials&gt;<b>True or False if the update download requires authentication</b>&lt;/RequireCredentials&gt;<br>  &lt;MoreInfoURL&gt;<b>Module additional info</b>&lt;/MoreInfoURL&gt;<br>&lt;/ModSignature&gt; <br></div><br><br>All the parameters marked in <i>bold</i> are the parameters that have to be customized for each module signature file (lmbs). As instance, for the Fontmachine module, we’ve created this lmbs file:<br><br><div class="quote"> &lt;?xml version=”1.0&amp;#8243;?&gt;<br>  &lt;ModSignature xmlns:xsi=”http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance” xmlns:xsd=”http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema”&gt;<br>  &lt;Name&gt;FontMachine module for Mojo&lt;/Name&gt;<br>  &lt;MajorVersion&gt;12&lt;/MajorVersion&gt;<br>  &lt;MinorVersion&gt;02&lt;/MinorVersion&gt;<br>  &lt;Revision&gt;17&lt;/Revision&gt;<br>  &lt;Build&gt;A&lt;/Build&gt;<br>  &lt;Kind&gt;ZipFolder&lt;/Kind&gt;<br>  &lt;UpdateURL&gt;http://www.jungleide.com/fontmachine-12-02-20-A.zip&lt;/UpdateURL&gt;<br>  &lt;RemoteSignatureURL&gt;http://www.jungleide.com/fontmachine.lmbs&lt;/RemoteSignatureURL&gt;<br>  &lt;ShortDescription&gt;This new version features some additional methods and has several visualization fixes&lt;/ShortDescription&gt;<br>  &lt;RequireCredentials&gt;false&lt;/RequireCredentials&gt;<br>   &lt;MoreInfoURL&gt;http://www.jungleide.com/fontmachine/&lt;/MoreInfoURL&gt;<br>&lt;/ModSignature&gt; <br></div><br><br>I’ll explain here each parameter:<br>• <b>Name</b>: This parameter is the module display name. The name that the module is given. It can be any natural name, if does not need to match the module folder name, but it has to be clear which module it is.<br><br>• <b>MajorVersion</b>, <b>MinorVersion</b>, <b>Revision</b> and <b>Build</b>: This parameters are used to identify the current module version. As instance, in the fontmachine module description above, the module version is 12.02.17-A (being, major, minor, revision and build). It is recommended that the major version contains the year of the module version, while the minor version contains the month, and the revision contains the day of the month when it was released. Also, a build letter to identify possible version released in the same day (quick fixes).<br><br>• <b>Kind</b>: This parameter indicates the way the module update is delivered. Currently only ZipFolder is supported. So this parameter is always ZipFolder (other uses are reserved for future version of the module updater tool).<br><br>• <b>UpdateURL</b>: This parameter has the URL location of the ZIP file containing the update described in this signature document. This signature file will be used to download the module, so we need to know where to find the Zip file in the Internet (or intranet or any other http location). The locatoin stated in this parameter has to be the location of the specific module version described in this signature document, and not the location of any other updated version.<br><br>• <b>RemoteSignatureURL</b>: This parameter has the location on Internet where the module signature of the very latest version of the module is located. Jungle Ide will compare current module description with the one located at this URL address to determine whether an update action is required on a specific module. To do so, we need to tell Jungle Ide where to find the latest module description (so it can compare versions information and act accordingly).<br><br>• <b>RequireCredentials</b>: This parameter has to be set to true if the module update download process requires http authentication to be completed. This functionality is not yet being supported, this parameter is reserved for future use.<br><br>• <b>MoreInfoURL</b>: This parameter contains a Internet location with additional information about the module. It’s usually the module official website.<br><br><br><b>2 Saving the module signature file.</b><br><br>The module signature file has to be saved at the root folder of the module, and it has to have the same name as the main module file, but with extension lmbs. As instance, the fontmachine module, has this files:<br><div class="quote"> <iframe src="http://apps.monkey-x.com/compiler/1/html5/MonkeyGame.php?width=640&amp;height=480" width="640" height="480" style="display:block;"></iframe>/modules/fontmachine/fontmachine.monkey<br><iframe src="http://apps.monkey-x.com/compiler/1/html5/MonkeyGame.php?width=640&amp;height=480" width="640" height="480" style="display:block;"></iframe>/modules/fontmachine/fontmachine.lmbs <br></div><br>The fontmachine.lmbs is the signature file for fontmachine.monkey module.<br><br><b>3 Preparing everything to work</b><br>Once you’ve created your module signature file, all you have to do is:<br><br>1.- Zip your module folder (including the module signature file) and upload it to the UpdateURL location you specified in the module signature file.<br><b>IMPORTANT:</b> You have to zip the module root folder in a way that the module main “monkey” file is on the “root” of the Zip file. If the zip file contains a folder containing the module, the process will fail to auto-update properly, as it will add an additional folder in the process. this is very important.<br><br>2.- Upload separately the module signature file (the lmbs file) to the RemoteSignatureURL specified on the module signature file. <b>It is very important</b> that if you are updating a previous version of your module, replace previous version with this one in the same URL.<br><br>That’s it! Your module is ready to update itself. All users that download your Zip file containing the module (with the module signature file in the module folder) will have an  auto-update ready version of your module,and Jungle Ide will detect this and act accordingly.<br><br><b>4 Releasing an update</b><br>Releasing an update is as easy as:<br><br>1.- Edit the local module signature file (the lmbs file in your module folder) and change the following:<br>The update version number (if you don’t do that, the update process won’t detect that an update has been done on the module).<br>The UpdateURL where this new version will be uploaded<br>The ShortDescription of this new release.<br><br>2.- Zip and upload the zip file to the UpdateURL. This has to be the same Update Url specified on the module signature file (lmbs)<br><br>3-. Upload separately you new lmbs file to THE SAME RemoteSignatureURL where previous version description was set (overwrite it).<br><br>That’s it! you’ve released an update for everyone. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

This new text renderer can differentiate the kind of a token before coloring it, so you can have a specific color for Classes, Interfaces, Methods, Functions, etc. and everything is colored in a scope-based fashion. Given the complexity of Monkey. this can a little CPU intensive, so people with ultra small devices may disable this on the preferences dialog.<br><br>• Added code autocompletion for #Rem / #End<br><br>• Improved the data type inference calculator so it now supports much more complex expressions.<br><br>• Better handling of public/private members on autolists. Private members are excluded from lists when they're defined on another module.<br><br>• Added a Private identifier to private items shown on autolists<br><br>• Better handling of Find&amp;Replace pre-selected text.<br><br>• ESC key now closes the go to line dialog, canceling the operation as in the Find and Replace dialog.<br><br><b>BREAKING CHANGE</b>: All the color definition stored in the "Color Definitions" area, in the Jungle Ide Framework folder are not compatible with the new text renderer. New text color schemes will be stored on a folder called "Color Definition v2.0" Also, your current color scheme will be reset after this update, but all the pre-defined presets that were present on previous Jungle Ide versions have been redesigned for the new renderer, and they're available on the presets lists.<br><br><b>NOTE</b>: The new lexed text rendering is performed on two passes. That can produce a slight flickering sometimes between passes. Everything has been designed to minimize this as much as possible while maintaining the multi-threaded optimized rendering. If your computer is too slow that it produces a very big flickering on text rendering, you can enable a "Force synchronization" parameter on the Monkey settings, on the preferences dialog. Not that we have had to activate on any of the computers this has been beta-tested but just in case...<br> <br></div><br><br>Get the update due regular updates process (Help/Check for Jungle Ide updates).<br><br>The free Jungle Lite free version and demo will be updated soon too.<br><br>Enjoy! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If you see a small combing, it's unevitable in current parser. You can enable the "Force lexer suncronization" option on the Monkey preferences dialog, but I'm not sure it'll be a lot better this way. This small swaping effect can only be disabled by disabling completelly the advanced lexed parser. <br>A double pass parser like this one has to be calculating things in two steps, one first step when the text is being tokenized, and a secondary step when each token is put in context. This second step is very complicated (it involves refactoring) and it's slow BUT it is calculated as part of the rendering, so it only happens one the text being displayed. That's why it can be seen when the whole page is scrolled (it re-calculates everything). There's not much I can do here, other than trying to optimize this step to make it as fast as possible. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It seems to me it does not search the entire project, only the currently open file? If so, why even generate a list - just [highlight]?<br><br>2. A really handy feature is "Jump to Definition". Likewise it is also really handy to have the backwards version of that "Find All Method Calls".<br><br>3. Now "Find All Method Calls" would be super mega awesome! But to me that is not a part of the Ctrl-F search, that is right-click method, find it beneath "Jump to definition". See point 5 for how I suggest that would be implemented. <br><br>4. What is the purpose of a "Find All" if it only searched the current file? A much neater feature is then instead that when the user selects some letters in a document all matches in the current document are selected - Meaning you get instant search &amp; feedback, instead of having to type into Find, clicking a button, viewing a list, clicking in list to see. <br><br>5. A "find in files" feature. Or search project for... That is also handy, not as handy, but sometimes it is useful, but mostly that is only when said feature 2 above does not exist. If this feature is what we are talking about I would recommend you attach the search-result list as a "tab" in the "output Console" and if user clicks "Find All/Genereate List" then this tab is selected, once the Search window is closed, the output tab switches back to default. I do not think it is handy to have the generated list in the small floating "Find and Replace" window. The output console probably already have the optimal size to display searches because of its width. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Much better than having a label that takes suddently two lines, gets truncated or just uses any other approach.

If it was not clear enough in my previous comments, I truly apreciate all your feedback as it's helpful and alows me to improve Jungle Ide. When you're designing a GUI for a task, it's very easy to make it not as intuitive as you would like, just becouse you're sometimes too focused on its internals, that you can get lost on the way this funcionality is presented to the final user, and that's what I think has happened to me a bit with the new search lists functionality. It works, but it is not presented in a way that the final user can easilly use it in its whole possibilities.
