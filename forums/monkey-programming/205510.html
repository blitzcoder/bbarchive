Heck he could even put a little voting thing on it.  He doesn't have to acknowledge it or pay attention to it :)  But it could be there.<br><br>I, for one, would like to know if IAP is even on his radar, or if adding PubCenter advertising is in there for Windows Phone because Admob doesn't work there, or if OUYA controller support is coming, etc.<br><br>Even if it's LOW priority, it can help me decide what to work on next.  If OUYA controller support isn't coming for a LONG time, well, I may just put my efforts elsewhere.  If it's a top-priority, I might just get all over it and start working on my app as if it's coming.<br><br>BTW - Don't derail this discussion with the OUYA controller stuff or IAP, it's not really about that, but more-so about having a roadmap.  <br><br>What would YOUR reasons be for wanting a roadmap?

Big time. Coronas roadmap is a bad example. A very bad one. Cause in the past it meant diddly shit. In 2010 i was heavily using Corona. And had heated discussions with them. The former Ceo tried to explain the dissapearence of their roadmap that they lost it. LOST IT. I switched to Gideros because i didnt believe in Ansca anymore. They didnt lost theirs but are helplessly back in schedule. Now TGC has brought in a Kickstarter to develop features they have promised before for free. <br><br>While a roadmap is nice, not many companies stick to them. It will cause even more complaining because things do not get developed in time or at all.<br><br>I do not see many things missing from Monkey anyway. It is so frickin open that you can do everything with it. But i can see you point when you want to be catered all the way or taken by the hand. If that was my goal, i would use a different tool. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Even if it isn't high priority right now.<br><br>The point is, if IAP isn't even on the list, I think we deserve to know that so we can determine how much time we need to dedicate to our own custom modules.<br><br>So, when new stuff rolls out like Cloud saves on iOS, and Google Play Services, it would be nice to see a roadmap where these items get added to the bottom.<br><br>I see a lot of people on these forums highly influencing the direction of Monkey with their persistence.  I just don't know why some things are chosen and others are not.  The GLFW thing for example.  Aren't MOST people using Monkey for mobile dev and other Blitz products for Desktop?  So, why on earth did this window resizing update get to seep into the top-priority list when Mobile technologies like IAP are still un-supported?<br><br>Obviously this is just my opinion, and I get that other features are important to other people, but it would be cool to see a roadmap with IAP on it, and the GLFW window resize above it.  That way - when updates like this come out - I'm not surprised at all.  That feature was above the one important to me, I knew that, so it was expected that it would come out first. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Imho if someone can not implement stuff they need themself, then Monkey might be a bad choice. I would then rather stick to solutions that promise these features to work right out of the box. <br>I see Monkeys philosophy as been open at a max with a powerful language to support your dev. Mark said right from the beginning that he does not intent to enhance its feature set big time. I would rather see him spent time on the easiness to add stuff and enhance TED.<br><br>I am also worried that his motivation will slag again, if he is pressured to much. It happen before i think when he announced that he rather work on his games. <br><br>of course this is just my opinion. You have a different one. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I think a feature request system would complement a roadmap nicely, but my personal feature requests will always have priority sorry.<br><br>Part of the reason I haven't been more forthcoming with a 'direction' for Monkey is because I've kinda been been scrambling just to keep up with getting things working in a reasonably consistent manner on all targets (and win8 has been a PITA time sink...). But I think it's getting there, and I've been actually been playing around with some brand new stuff recently.<br><br>I'll also admit I've been kind of hit and miss in what I implement in terms of 'feature requests' along the way, but I've always tried to at least focus at least on the 'nuts and bolts' stuff, which IMO is language, graphics, audio, input and more recently networking - and making it as consistent as practical/possible. It's what I know/enjoy, so no great surprise there.<br><br>The monetization/social stuff I'm way less familiar/comfortable with. I eventually implemented admob and gamecenter modules because people were obviously struggling to get them working, but in general I would prefer to see the community deal with all the chartboosts and flurries out there. I realize this is not easy - I still haven't really come up with a clean/flexible way for people to hook into the guts of the targets, but it's on the roadmap! Well, it will be...<br><br>Anyway, I'll do a blog update soon and go into a bit more detail. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

My hope would be that you start to voice your ideas about what is core, what is community-driven but supported (i.e. you consider important enough to test against or form a pre-release test group for) and what is just in the wind. I would expect IAP to be in the middle group. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I think it is necessary so that people don't waste their time, if nothing else.  It would suck, for example, if Xaron spent a month getting IAP working and you were working on it and came out with it 3 days before he was finished.  If we have a clear delineation of what we should work on and what you are working on then the Monkey community will benefit greatly. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
