What Leo Santos seems to want is custom method overloads akin to what can be achieved in other languages (C++ for example). Monkey has had this limitation for years, and if I'm not mistaken, Mark's planning on fixing this in Monkey 2. Basically, if the overload could work with another name, or is valid under the context of a super-class, then there's no reason the overload can't exist. It's a convenience thing. You don't want to use a different name when there's no conflict.<br><br>That being said, you should <b>NEVER</b> expect to be able to make an overload that overrides a previous overload, without the <b>exact same</b> prototype. If you wish to call another overload/implementation, this can be done normally from within your method. The only way to add specialization from top-down (Using the base-class, but expecting behavior defined in the derived class) is to do what Ziggy suggests. That's considered bad practice in most situations, even when a virtual override is involved. Dynamic casting and derived-type specialization should be avoided in base classes. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

</pre><br><br>As a side note, does casting things like that have a noticeable impact in performance?

Well, if you now inherit Rectangle and use the Copy method, which version should be called? The one that expects a Vector or the one that expects a Rectangle?

The custom overload in the derived class is/should only going to be called from the derived class. The only way to break the Liskov principle here is to override methods. Either way, that principle isn't necessarily relevant here. The original intent seemed to be having a way to copy another object's contents, which was at the same or higher level of the hierarchy. In other words, 'Vector' only handles 'Vectors', and 'Rectangle' only (Implicitly) handles 'Rectangles'. I mentioned how C++ handles this before. In C++11 and beyond, you're encouraged to state that a method is an override to an implementation. This only applies to <i>virtual</i> methods, which can be polymorphic (Mutated by derived classes). For custom methods which do not actually override an existing method-prototype, using 'override' is invalid. This was part of the reasoning behind adding that keyword.<br><br>But that's just it, though, you can create whatever custom overloads you want in C++. That's because it's a <b>compile-time</b> problem I'm speaking of. It's not a polymorphic problem (Unless you add extra complexity by making the other overloads <i>virtual</i>). A specific quirk to C++ is making super-class overloads opt-in (Multiple inheritance is likely behind the reasoning). Basically, what Monkey does currently, but only when there's new overloads in the derived class. Compared to Monkey, where any override to one of your super-class's overloads will result in complete encapsulation until stated otherwise. This would be fine, but then you have the issue of not having your own overload choices in derived classes.<br><br>Leo Santos's second example does show what you were referring to, but in the context he's doing that, it wouldn't need the runtime overhead if he had chosen a different name for 'Copy' in the derived class, or we had better overloading behavior.<br><br>@Leo Santos:<br>That's not exactly the best option. You're using runtime type evaluation, meaning it's going to have some overhead. It's not too serious, but if it's in a collision routine, you have better options. I suggest either a different name (If possible), or giving in, and placing the overload in the base class. It really depends on how you're using 'Copy'. If you need it to handle the types without knowing them, then you're going to have to use a dynamic cast. Generally speaking, you're supposed to avoid that kind of situation. Dynamic casts aren't free.<br><br>Also, your particular example should cache the cast on the stack, so you're not doing it 3+ times. Something like this:<br><textarea class=codebox name="code" wrap=OFF readonly="true" rows="15" cols="80">
Local R:= Rect(other)

If (R &lt;&gt; Null) Then
	Self.width = R.width
	Self.height = R.height
End
</textarea><br><br>Again, not the best option if you can avoid it. Also, you unfortunately can't use generics to make the method-overload problem any better, because:<br>A): You couldn't use 'Vector' normally without an interface anyway.<br>And B): You can't (Currently) reference the current class when inheriting.
