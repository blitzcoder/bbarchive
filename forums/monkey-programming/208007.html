Monkey is not a tool like Corona for an example, that spits out a complete apk file for you to upload. You need to setup your development environment like you would do when you develop natively. <br>Actually you need to do that to a certain extend with other tools like Corona too. Soemtimes Windows is harder to setup than OSX. But still you need to get familiar with the toolchain. <br><br>I don't think it is Monkeys responsibility to explain every little step that it takes to get an APK into the Google market. The requirements change pretty often and I don't think Monkey has to document these changes and requirements. Google already does that, but it can be sometimes hard to understand. Same goes for Apple.<br><br>New developers see tools like Monkey and others and think it is very easy to start mobile dev. Or HTML5 dev. You hit a button and the tool does everythign for you. But it isn't, developing a game is just one step in the whole process. And that goes with all the tools out there. You need to read up on the platform you want to target, there is no way around that. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

To me it's more of a intermediate language akin to C#/Java/C/C++.<br>But someone who is new to programming stumbles cross the Monkey site, browses through the those big flashy pages and may get the impression that Monkey does it all for you. There is not one mention in the overview that you will require to install additional tools and software development kits unless you actually go into the documentation and as any one who has use BRL products in the past knows what the documentation tends to be like. Nor is there any mention that due to Monkey targeting a number of platforms that certain features will not be available to all targets and you will have to implement these yourself which means you need to learn about the target and the programming language used for that targets SDK.<br><br>As for the community. I find it possibly one of the best and helpful, especially for new users. The biggest problem is that the same questions keep getting asked again and again. This can be down to people either not reading/understanding the documentation or the lack of it; or not using the form search or not formulating the search criteria to get the results your looking for.

The question I would like to ask is have you had any programming experience? Have you done any artwork using any paint programs? Have you done any thing with creating audio? If the answer is no then it's going to be a bit of a steep learning curve, but every one has to start somewhere. Just don't be expecting to write games like some of those on the apps section right way. Writing computer games is possibly one of the most challenging forms of computer programming as you have to do many things in real time and not all hardware or devices are the same. When you buy a game for the PC you see a "system requirements"; This should be read as "This is the minimum system that it will run on and not very good at that". When you wish to write a game for multiple devices you have to keep this in mind at all times. What may work well for an iPhone may not work so well on a Android Device.<br><br>Even if you have had experience at programming, art and sound it can be quite a task. If you are not familiar with an device, operating system or a application. Then you could spend hours getting the anything to work or work correctly. You should do a search on the problems that you can get with just installing Visual Studio. There have been a few times when I have sworn and almost thrown the computer out of the window because third party tools and Software Development Kits. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I do agree that Monkey could stand to be more beginner-friendly-- there are some conceptual hurdles that can be a bit difficult to get to grips with.<br><br>If you work at it and study and modify the examples you will figure it out.  People here will help.<br><br>I suggest that you begin working with one target, specifically GLFW.  That requires installation of the free Microsoft VC2010 compiler, and I think instructions are in the help.  Don't even think about android at this point because that will require a whole other ball of wax.  <br><br>At the risk of not sounding encouraging, I will say that game programming is pretty close to profoundly difficult and is the hardest thing I've done other than higher math.  You should evaluate the degree of desire you have to program games, because you're going to need to want it real bad.  If you don't want to deal with this kind of headache five times a day, or sometimes a bad week of hair tearing, you are better off doing just about anything other than programming games for a living.  That's just the reality of it.  You get used to it over time.  <br><br>What you are running into right now is called "compiler fun," the difficulties of setting Up the software for an unfamiliar language.  It is a hurdle with just about any language out there, for some reason it's always hard, but Monkey is about 2/10 on the difficulty scale.<br><br>When you get the compiler set up, welcome to programming, which is basically similar to predicate calculus.<br><br>At the same time, John Carmack started somewhere.

I run into this with "most" development software I use.  To me the math and figuring out how to make things work, with some exceptions of course, is FAR easier than trying to guess my way through how someone else decided that the packaging should work, what versions are compatible, where things need to be, what paths will work (I've run into problems where specifying a path breaks because I often install things on secondary drives), etc or trying to follow a bunch of directions that may not be complete as the creator thought, or have changed enough that one can't transfer enough knowledge to understand what they're saying.  <br>There is no "debugger" to help figure out what is wrong most of the time, other than it fails, and generally it's a mess that varies from 20 minutes of time, to sometimes whole days to get something working.<br>This is made worse because I often don't know what Monkey is doing internally, and with a large code base, it can be hard to find, even for the code that is open to me.<br>What this really needs is a theory of action/general principles about what Monkey needs to see and why, about what the various terms mean, and why you need certain parts/how they are referenced by Monkey (how the config files work).

I think the best course would be to state, with every release, what SDK version for each platform Monkey has been tested to work with (what was current at the time), and on what OS version(s), as well as state that in the instructions.

Then it could be a security risk if it's not updated when a new release of the JRE/JDK comes out.<br>Some people just add environment variables to the system and just forget all about them.<br><br>JAVA_HOME would be OK as long as they are using the JDK part and not the JRE part that is in the JDK directory. On Linux if you want use Oracle JDK/JRE you either have to rely on a third party PPA or use the JAVA_HOME and add JAVA_HOME with sub directories in a .profile or updatealternatives along with system links for browser plugins and keep them update manually. The PPA are treated like any other Linux package repository.<br><br><div class="quote"> Probably best to just get them to set this as part of JDK installation. <br></div>For Monkey, I would just go with the zip file extraction for Android. After all, you have programmed transcc to use it's own environment set up i.e: JDK_PATH. If a user decides to use another tools to edit/compile the resulting Monkey code, etc, Then they should follow that tools install/set up instructions. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
