Here's my experience so far, for what it's worth. I've been working at making games for about 7 years, for myself and for clients. I've been programming with Monkey for about a year and a half, and was using Flash before that. I got started using Monkey when I started looking for an option to bring some of my flash games to ios and android. <br><br><div class="quote"> What type/kind of games have you published? <br></div><br><br>So far only one with Monkey:<br><a href="http://www.rawkins.com/dolphin-up" target="_blank">http://www.rawkins.com/dolphin-up</a><br><br><div class="quote"> How much profit is generated from sales? <br></div><br><br>It varies from month to month. It's not enough for me to develop games full time, but it helps a lot. I would say it currently generates about 1/3 of my income, with the rest coming from contract work.<br><br><div class="quote"> How much in expenses(graphics, tools, etc) do you usually spend to develop your game? <br></div><br><br>I use adobe creative cloud, dropbox, Jungle IDE, texture packer, and of course Monkey. A windows laptop, and a mac mini for ios dev, ipad + ipod + htc android phone for testing. I would guess about $2000, roughly?  I occasionally buy stock art, but try to do most of it myself.<br><br><div class="quote"> How much time is spent developing your game? <br></div><br><br>I'm not really sure. I should probably be tracking this. I think it took me around 3 or 4 months to make Dolphin Up, and that was porting an already existing game to Monkey. I was learning Monkey at the same time (along with xcode/ios and Android), so I think I would be faster next time. I still support the game with updates as well, which eats up quite a bit of time, especially in the always-changing world of mobile development.<br><br><div class="quote"> What techniques do you employ to market your game? <br></div><br><br>Twitter &amp; facebook, contacting media outlets. Like a lot of developers I don't put enough effort into marketing. I know I should blog more and network more but it's so easy to ignore it and put it off.<br><br><div class="quote"> I guess what I'd like to know is if it's possible to make a living off of writing games? If it's highly unlikely how much is usually made, what's the hours of development to return ratio? <br></div><br><br>It's not for me yet, but I want it to be. I think it's possible, but it's not easy. I also think that building the game is the easy part. The business/marketing side is the real challenge, especially in such a crowded marketplace. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Not because we have a wider market for this but because it was localized even with the name "Schiffe versenken". If you search for battleship you'll find dozends of games, but using the name "Schiffe versenken" there are only a few. So it might be indeed good to concentrate on localized markets! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
