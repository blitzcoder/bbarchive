I THINK lol.... <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The touch input was a little confusing and weird to get to grips with when I first started with monkey, but like everything else it becomes second nature after a while, I also made my classes work with therevill's autofit module, which was completely painless.<br><br>Having the controls visible over portions of the game works, but really aint that desirable, all too often you're obscuring the world your trying to navigate with your thumbs. The solution to that is to define a part of the display where its dedicated for controls, but that shrinks the actual game area, for me touch is all about trade-offs.<br><br>Then there's invisible controls, say you were making a platform game like mario and the only controls were left, right and jump. you could make each half of the display a giant button for left and right, and when you touch both at the same time you jump, no overlay for the controls needed! some games do this and it seems a good solution for simple platform games.<br><br>Touch input is definitely better suited to puzzle and RTS type games than fast paced action games as you don't get anything in the way of feedback, you don't know if your finger has slipped off a control without looking at the control because there's nothing to feel.<br><br>The only real solution is to experiment like a madman to determine what types of controls are best suited to a particular game style. this can be beyond tedious at times, but when you get it right, it can be very rewarding.<br><br>Cheers, Grant. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

E.g. if dragging an item is implemented, maybe tap and tap to select and move can work too, or tap and joypad. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

But you can usually come up with something, if you allow yourself a few concurrent control schemes, like cursors do one thing, mouse/touch does something else. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
