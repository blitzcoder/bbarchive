Why don't we create a BRL youtube channel and show our creations also there? Videos there could also be shown here somewhere in this site (shouldn't be too complicated now that we have embedable youtubes). If it works, maybe BRL could also put some of those videos in the frontpage.<br>I'm saying this becouse I see some major drawbacks for not-yet newcomers:<br><br>1.- The provided samples do not exist unless you have the curiosity to see whatever should be stored on this "bannas foder" (not very intuitive).<br><br>2.- The samples provided are great to understand how monkey works once you have decided you want it, but they're not makig Monkey look as cool as it is, so I think there's a hole to be filled here. Something that makes the language appealing, and this has a lot more to do with how the samples look, than what they actually do.<br><br>3.- The Apps section here is a great plus, really, but the fact that it is working on HTML5 makesit very inconsitent accross browsers and it is the less performant Monkey target right now, so it does not cause exactly the best impression of the world.<br><br>Just some thoughts, I hope this is constructive and helpful in some way.It seems BRL is making some small steps regarding Marketing, we could maybe help push the whole thing up a little bit, as Monkey is one the most wonderful dev tools I've used in the last years, but it's hard to make "the world" kwnow how good it is. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

If someone was confident enough, I think a series of "Hello World" video examples for each platform would be useful. Now personally I am aware these would basically be the same except for the installation of the SDK's but it would provide a presence for each individual target should someone search for "easy iphone game development"<br><br>Also, maybe some one could come up with a "Made with Monkey" kind of logo to help promote the tools for those interested.
