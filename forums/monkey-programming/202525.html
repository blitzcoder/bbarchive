In my opinion programming is basically the manipulation of data. It's then is just a case of working out what is the best/most efficient way of handling that data.<br>In the old 8 bit days when you wanted speed you had to learn about the machine you were programming for and the CPU's instruction set. In many cases the CPU's instruction set would have a few powerful instructions that would take quite a few clock cycles to complete but only take a few bytes in memory. Many of these instructions could be written in code and take a few clock cycles less but would use more memory. Then there was how to store the data as memory was limited so the programmers had to figure out the best way to store that information. One of the best examples is probably <a href="http://www.seasip.demon.co.uk/Jsw/jsw2room.html" target="_blank">Jet Set Willy II</a> room format. Another optimisation was to try and cut down on how many function calls were made in a loop. If the function was only a few bytes it made more sense to in-line that piece of code.  <br>In this day and age there are optimising compliers that do most of the work for you. And as mobile devices could be considered the "new" 8 bit computers of the modern world, many of the things learned back in those days would be useful again.<br><br><div class="quote"> I have taken a type/class given it a source file of its own and then any function/method that deals with that type/class will be found in it's source file. <br></div>I also do it that way as well.

But all projects should start with a design document giving an outline of the program. There are a few templates for these documents. The one by Mark Baldwin looks good so have a google for it. Using this document I would flesh out my ideas using a combination of descriptions, drawings, flow charts and pseudo code. When I actually come to coding the first thing is always the media loading and sprite routines using a skeleton loop for testing. Then I would write and test the code for each part individually before writing the main program loop and integrating the other code modules. As how all these bits of code should plug together depends on how each module was designed.<br><br>One way is to study other peoples code to see how they did things.
