Not sure what was going on but it seems like because the mouse-up flag was only being set for one single frame, that wasn't enough for the code to 'catch' it.  I modified my mouse class a bit to allow a 0.5-second window after mouse release before the flag is reset, and that did the trick.  I'll revisit the issue when I get things running in iOS in case it was just an HTML5 oddity. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
