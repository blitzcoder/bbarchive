Then it did not work out. Maybe now something will change.<br><br>I suggest to create a large group of modules - "Pub". Similar to what we have now from Blitz Research (brl) and what was in BlitzMax. The purpose of these modules - to extend the basic Monkey functional. To allow users to connect only one module and get access to all the advanced functional.<br><br>What does this module may contain?<br><br>Well, for example<br>- Various parsers, i.e.xml, json, csv, etc.<br>- Module for working with regular expressions<br>- Module for working with database<br>- Module with additional streams. For example, zipstream<br><br>And other common modules like md5, base64, etc.<br><br>As you can see, these are the often-used and common modules. They almost aren't attached to the platforms, so some of them can be written in pure Monkey and will work on all targets. Pub module will not contain game frameworks, modules that are tied to the advertising network, or use various web services.<br><br>I know that a lot of this is already exists in various individual modules from different authors. But I don't find it comfortable.<br><br>Pub module won’t have a single author. Each person can connect to the development or offer his module. The decision on the inclusion this or that module will be made by community, by voting. Thereby we can unite our efforts in order to create more interesting and useful modules. All modules will be distributed as a Public Domain. <br><br>Pub module will have it’s own public page on GitHub or Bitbucket, where the repositories with modules will be stored. Due to this code will always be available for download. And also there will be a version control.<br><br>Pub module will have strict naming. For example pub.parser.xml or pub.stream.zip etc. Or something like that. It is necessary to discuss. Also, all modules will be documented, just like standard Monkey modules are documented.<br><br>All modules will be very simple and will provide only basic functional. This does not restrict others to create alternative modules. Also, it won’t be one big module. It will be a lot of small modules gathered in one place.<br><br>This is how I see it. I would like to know your opinion. What do you think about this? Does anyone would like to participate in this or you ready to insert your own module in to the pub? Which modules would you like to see here?<br><br>Any suggestions are welcomed <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Restating it a little: I see the problems with module discoverability but I don't think that creating a big shared workspace is a good solution.<br><br>There's nothing wrong with creating a collection of useful modules if you want (I'm sure the diddy guys would agree that diddy itself is really such a grab-bag of handy libraries more than a framework) but I don't see that it solves the underlying issue, which is that people can't <i>find</i> the modules they are looking for.

I think it will be possible to discuss the modules schemes, if we decide to implement it.<br><br><b>@muddy_shoes</b> Unfortunately, time passed, and the issue only became worse. We still need some basic modules, which we would like to have. And those that we already have are sometimes hard to find.<br><br>Newbies often ask me: “How do I read xml?” I say - "Use diddy", but they are already using fantomEngine. And I have to explain that you don’t need to import the entire module and it isn’t necessary to use diddy as a framework to read xml. This is very confusing ...<br> <br>I can create another module like diddy. And call it devolonter, for example. But will it tell anyone that there are libraries that read various formats and many more useful things?<br><br>I suggest to make Pub module - as the unofficial standard module for Monkey. A small basic modules register, if you wish. It will be easy to search in it, and good documentation will be helpful for newbies.<br><br>Why a lot of separate submodules instead of one? In order that each module has its own repository, and everyone could do its fork. Also, to be able to get different versions for each module separately. But everything should be under one roof in order to follow the same standard and to be in one place.<br><br>I think it wouldn’t be a huge bunch. In fact, it will be good if there are at least 10 modules. I suggest to do only what is really necessary in almost all applications. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It's just a different bag of stuff to look in and understand. Yours might be easier to comprehend as a utility collection, better documented, structured etc. but it's still the same thing.<br><br>Again, I'm not against anyone creating a module collection. If you want to do that, then fine. If you want to include my box2d, json or whatever modules then you're very welcome to do so. It's just not an approach that I see as particularly productive.<br><br>The thing is that we supposedly have a central module register that, <i>in principle</i>, resolves the exact problems you're talking about. In practice it's a minimal effort implementation that is unloved and unused. I really think that BRL should step up and resolve those problems but I'd certainly be interested in discussing a "better register" as something separate from your module collection idea. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Now seriously, a simple 2D vector is not really a functional complex implementation like an XML parser. I agree that some very basic classes could be added to Mojo or to the language itself. That said, I don't see the benefits of a centralized framework of modules that are not a framework.<br>I think it would be much much better to have a proper way to publish open source modules here, and allow users to rate them and state the compatibility level with latest official Monkey release. Sort of what they do with wordpress plugins. But I don't know if the complexity of this development is worth it given the small comunity we are (yet?). <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Moreover, the perspective of searching and downloading numerous modules in order to just start writing an app really demotivates.<br><br>I note that I am not against the alternative. If a module provides the ability to read xml along with the framework - this is great! If there is a faster implementation - this is great too! But I think it would be also good to have the opportunity to get extended functions with one click, not being tied to a particular framework. Yes, maybe it won’t be the best choice or not the best implementation, but it's just what might help to quickly start writing code. As if it was bootstrap.<br><br>Let me repeat once again. Modules will contain only basic functionality. There will be no super-duper huge modules with dozens of dependencies. In an ideal, one module - one purpose.<br><br>I also agree with the fact that there is a problem with the current module registry. And pub module will not resolve this problem. It would be great to have a module registry with categories, tags, rating and compatibility information. When I’ll start  to do module's page design I can provide how I see it. There, we could also discuss it. Even if BRL refuses to implement it - we can do it on our own.<br><br>Also it would be good to have some command-line utility for importing modules with all dependencies. This could be done based on the module registry.<br><br>Thank you <b>muddy_shoes</b> and <b>Skn3</b> for your consent to the inclusion of modules! Now we have something to begin with. And we need to think about the best way to use it.<br><br>I originally did not plan to make code review and bring everything to a single structure. Only strict naming convention and good documentation were in the plans. I don’t want to complicate everything, because I think it's better to spend energy on writing new modules. But if you think that it is not very good, then we can discuss the schemes of module interfaces.<br><br>As for the administration. I’ve created (renamed and cleaned former MonkeyModules) organization on GitHub - <a href="https://github.com/pub-monkey" target="_blank">https://github.com/pub-monkey</a> Here I plan to keep all repositories, as well as to have a discussion. Also in the main repository there will be wiki with information for contributors and users. In the future, we can make a small site with more information.<br><br>I may include anyone who wishes as contributor. I also think that it need to be added another 1-2 administrators to avoid losing access to the control panel, if one of us wants to leave.<br><br><b>Skn3</b>, <b>Shinkiro1</b> I know that you have accounts on GitHub. Would you like to join this organization? I can send you an invitation.<br><br><b>Important!</b> I do not insist on GitHib. And if you have objections please let me know. I also think that the pub-monkey may not be the best name, so I’m ready to change it. But I think the name is not so important, eventually.<br><br>As soon as we’ll figure out all the organizational issues, I suggest to go over to making naming convention and  preparing roadmap. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
