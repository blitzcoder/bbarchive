I'm assuming you cant put mountain lion on that machine.<br><br>This is fine whilst monkey supports both xcode versions. I tested some monkey xcode projects, they moved from xcode4 to xcode5 with no issues (aside from a base sdk setting), so I'd hope monkey can continue to support both, but obviously its not for me to say.<br><br>You'd not be able to use or test any ios7 features, you'd have to build/test against ios6. But, using the latest sdk is not a requirement (yet..). sdk6/ios6 became a requirement indirectly, since it added support for the new wider screen iphones.<br><br>My mac isnt much newer than yours, and I expect its at the end of the road, since I know its too old to run Mavericks. So, in a year or so, it wont get an xcode update, then I'm screwed :/ <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Then,  you can time your update to coincide with a new sdk or device release, and maybe gain some attention by being early to support it.<br><br>I dont see anything vital in ios7 (?!), I guess 64-bit builds will become mandatory for new apps at some point. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

I think I fared quite well with the $2,400 purchase I made back then. It was fresh on the market at the time, and really it still performs quite well despite the fact it no longer can get updated Mac OS releases. I replaced the battery once, upgraded the HDD from 120GB to 500GB, and maxed the memory from 1GB to 3GB, and replaced the power brick, as the cord was nibbled on by my cats. All else works fine with the exception that just recently in the past couple of weeks, I noticed a couple of keys on my keyboard are not as responsive. 7 years with only those few issues is not bad for ANY computer.<br><br>I use XCode 4.6.3 on this even and it runs just fine. I can tell its aging though as my work Windows laptop smokes it in many ways :( I'm upgrading around Christmas time to the new MacBook Pro 15" with Retina. I'm gonna grab the better of the options because its gonna be 5 years before I upgrade again :)<br><br>I might see if XCode 5 will even work on this. If not, oh well.
