While looking at some recent threads on arrays, I noticed that a lot of people have problems at first dealing with initializing them, and understanding the behavior and syntax of higher dimension arrays.  Muddy_shoes wrote an interesting class to return an initialized 2d array, but the syntax can be a bit awkward and I was thinking of perhaps taking it one step further and making my own Array2D/Array3D container classes.<br><br>When thinking about this, however, I soon realized that Monkey properties have a number of limitations that make this difficult, if not impossible to implement in the expected fashion.  Two of the things that would be a lot more helpful to simplify the syntax would be if Monkey could support multiple arguments in a property, and were also able to support default properties.  <br><br>Now, I know the latter sounds like a bad idea at first to anyone who remembers the pain of VB6 syntax, but since then, the syntax of default properties have changed such that there are no longer any ambiguities when it comes to setting an object reference -- default properties in VB.NET require at least one argument, and have a special keyword attached to the property in the class.  There's a few MSDN articles on the subject;  I will link one to show how it's done in modern VB, and then one to show how it's changed from VB6 and why it's better now.<br><br><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/se6z814t.aspx" target="_blank">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/se6z814t.aspx</a><br><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/h7bfkxc1%28v=vs.90%29.aspx" target="_blank">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/h7bfkxc1%28v=vs.90%29.aspx</a><br><br>While default properties may not sound like it would be very useful to make code easier to read (in fact, it could easily do the opposite), it is ideal for simplifying the syntax of container classes such as a hypothetical Array container.

Some ways to work around this would be to always assume the property of type Void is the setter, and to always assume the first argument is the "value" (or require the setter value to be always named "value";  this may or may not require reserving the word, which of course could break existing code).  Another potential workaround would be to reserve Get/Set (or Getter/Setter) keywords or change the property syntax -- this could also break existing code.<br><br>Properties seem like they were a rather late, though welcome, addition to the Monkey language.  I'd think it would be really nice if they could be extended to support a few more things, however.  What do you guys think? <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Being from a VB background, I can tell you that I didn't realize how bad an idea they were until seeing how every other language did it.  The existing reference assignment and comparison behavior should be maintained, and we should probably avoid any default properties that don't take arguments.  Perhaps I don't understand the code example, but it seems like it doesn't take any arguments.<br><br>That being said, I'd still like to see default properties implemented a bit, the way .net does it -- but perhaps not as much as I'd like to see properties which take multiple arguments be implemented :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Basically, if you are looking to access an instance member without explicitly specifying that member (which is what I'm presuming you mean by "automatic" properties), the syntax with reference comparisons becomes messed up.  VB6 handled this by reserving the <b>Set</b> keyword for reference assignment.  I don't remember how it did reference comparison, but I assure you it was confusing, because if you had a default property without an extra argument, you could have code like this:<br><br><pre class=code>
'both of these are Object or Variant
Dim foo 'pretend this has a default property "quux" which returns "OK"; for brevity, not shown here.
Dim bar 'pretend this has a default property "zz" which returns "NG"

Print foo.quux  'returns "OK"
Print foo 'returns "OK"
foo = "Okay"   'Assigns default property, NOT reference.
Print foo.quux 'returns "Okay"

Print bar   'returns "NG"
foo = bar  'Assigns the value of bar.zz to foo.quux, NOT the reference.
Print foo.quux  'returns "NG"

'Now, let's set foo back to normal.
foo = "OK"

If foo = bar then Print "True" else Print "False"  'Prints false.
Set foo = bar 'this is how you set object reference in VB6 / VBA

'Does the following line do reference comparisons, or default property comparisons?
If foo = bar then Print "True" else Print "False"  
</pre><br><br>Maybe you can see the problem with default properties which don't take extra arguments with this example..?  <br><br>I would loathe to see something like this wiggle its way into Monkey, which is why I worded my proposal <i>very carefully</i> so as not to have anyone think I was suggesting it, or have anyone else make the suggestion.  It's just a bad idea.  OOP was bolted onto VB as a bit of an afterthought;  it took compatibility-breaking changes to the language (including its core syntax) to fix the problems VB6 introduced.  We wouldn't want something like that happening with Monkey !<br><br><div class="quote"> properties which take multiple arguments, are no properties... per definition. They are called methods ;) <br></div><br><br>Basically, when I say I'm looking for a property which takes multiple arguments, I'm looking to overload a method in a property-like way -- with a single getter and setter.  The setter would take exactly one extra argument from the getter in its declaration.  The way to accessing this kind of property is still syntactically different to a Method --  this is already explained both in my code snippets in my first post, and in the corresponding MSDN articles.

The interface of the class (with the exception of inheritance) only contains public access. Whatever happens behind-the-scenes are private, and not of concern to anyone using the class.<br><br>This means anything public is part of an interface.

While it helps with encapsulation it gets messy quickly - and it takes a lot of time to change such an interface.<br><br>After properties things changed. Methods is now used mostly for modifying/writing to the class, and properties are used to read from the class.

With auto-properties code becomes more <b>readable</b> and encapsulation becomes less of a mess. <br><br>Big Note:<br>1. However auto-properties with public GET and SET are the same as a Field, and are useless. <br>2.

Obviously auto-properties with private SET &amp; GET are also useless, since that is the same as a private field.<br><br>---&gt; The only thing needed to increase OOP coding in the majority of cases is to have a way to make a Field private SET and public GET.

A bunch of people I know are saying that multi-parameter properties are not the way to go about solving these sorts of problems, and while they didn't recommend indexers either (most of them being from a C, and not .NET background), I had the distinct impression that multi-parameter properties are not a popular idea among non-VB coders at all.  I'm not even sure how popular the idea of an indexer is, either, but I think it should be an open discussion.  <br><br>There was this thing thrown out there about true operator overloading being the 'real' answer to this problem, but again I'm wondering if that's just airy CS people talk.  I'm just looking for ways functionality can be added to existing object constructs in a way that's simple, straightforward, and reduces necessary code output without complicating the language.  That, and offering the ideas up and hoping they're taken into consideration :) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
