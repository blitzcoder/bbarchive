You're supposed to just call 'Close' when you're done. I'm not sure if there's some kind of asynchronous version, though. If there is, maximum compatibility would be achieved by keeping it asynchronous. From what I know, there isn't, though. You should just be able to write your own code for proper disconnection, then when that process is done, you simply close the socket ("Socket.Close()"). And of course, you'll need to make a timeout system for improper disconnections, but you get the idea.<br><br>If something's undocumented, you can look at the source code of its module (<a href="https://github.com/blitz-research/monkey/blob/develop/modules/brl/socket.monkey" target="_blank">'brl.socket'</a>).<br><br>As for 'UpdateAsyncEvents', the following demo works:<br><textarea class=codebox name="code" wrap=OFF readonly="true" rows="15" cols="80">

The answer is pretty awful, and it's not Mark's fault. When 'Receive' is called (Or technically, ReceiveAsync's underlying 'Receive'), the operating system will retrieve what's on the network stack. The thing is, if no message (packet) is available, then it will poll (Wait) until it gets a packet. The only exception to this rule is if a socket is disconnected. If we're talking about UDP, then this is normally very rare, and you'd be using a single host-socket, anyway. UDP handles "connections" differently, and they're not used very often, as they're not as nice as TCP for this kind of thing. It's better to keep UDP connectionless, or to roll your own. But for TCP, you're dealing with sockets for each connection, meaning if that socket becomes disconnected as defined by TCP's standards (There are several, if you're interested), then the operating system will stop polling, and your program using 'Receive' (Either on another thread with 'ReceiveAsync', or on the main thread using a blocking setup) will continue. Since we use this setup, the only proper solution is to have the OS tell the user that nothing was received (Through the return-value). In other words, a socket is disconnected when the packet's length (As described by 'Receive') is zero.<br><br>So basically, if you're using the asynchronous functionality, you'd do this:<br><textarea class=codebox name="code" wrap=OFF readonly="true" rows="15" cols="80">
Method OnReceiveComplete:Void(data:DataBuffer, offset:Int, count:Int, source:Socket)
	If (Not count) Then ' AKA, 'count' is zero.
		Print("TcpEchoServer: Closing client connection.")
		
		' This needs to be done in order to properly close the socket.
		' This will also set the 'IsConnected' property's projected value to 'False'.
		' Just for the record, 'source' and '_socket' in Mark's example are the same.
		source.Close()
		
		Return
	Endif
	
	' As stated above, technically, 'source' and '_socket' are the same thing.
	' So, this could be 'source', which might be something you'd like to do.
	' This use of 'SendAsync' is irrelevant, though.
	' You don't need to use it; it's only for the echo demo to begin with.
	_socket.SendAsync(data, offset, count, Self)
	
	Return
End
</textarea><br><br>That was taken from the "echoserver_tcp.monkey" example, I just made it cleaner. This design works for both servers, and clients (Technically, but you may need to add to this). But, since Monkey's "state" setup for 'IsConnected' and similar properties gets changed when 'Close' is called, the end result is 'IsConnected' being 'False'. This means that you should still be checking against that (What you seemed to be doing), but you need to close the connection via 'OnReceiveComplete' first. You could also set up your own system for this, instead of keeping the 'Socket' around, but you get the idea.<br><br>That <i>should</i> fix your problem. Checking against the address isn't a good idea for this. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
