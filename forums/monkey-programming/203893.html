I can't believe I wasted several months writing a book about Monkey and it simply isn't working. Mark fooled us all. :-))) <br>Jokes aside, actually it is hard to help you with this much information you gave. What samples/modules did you try to run? Did you try to use MiniB3D? If you have problems with 3rd party modules, then you might need to contact their creators. Which version of Visual Studio do you have installed. Which version of GLFW? <br>Regarding HTML5, it runs very well on all browsers if you have the newest versions installed. For other platforms you need to install the correct tools and SDK. Plus link them correctly inside the config file of your platform. Again, calm down, there are hundreds of users who have no problems with Monkey. <br>I am running Monkey on OSX and there it is very a smooth experience. On windows it might be a little bit more work to get all the platforms running, but I think  the amjority of users use Windows. So it should be doable. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
