This means that <u>if there is nothing referencing the object, it will be collected automatically</u>. The exact behavior of garbage collection is platform-specific, so it's not exactly one garbage collector you're working with.<br><br>The best way to think about the storage of objects is that if nothing cares about it, it's already free. With that said, certain precautions should be taken. For example, marking an object as "free" when you've removed it from a collection may be suitable. Alternatively, when it comes to very frequent or very large allocations, <a href="http://www.monkey-x.com/docs/html/Modules_brl.pool_Pool.html" target="_blank">a pool could be used to manage references to objects</a>.<br><br>Pools effectively allow you to control the lifetimes of objects. This means a user could request an object, use it, then give it back, without the need for the garbage collector to touch the area of memory. This of course means you can know ahead of time if an object should "live" or "die".<br><br>The interesting thing about this approach is that it promotes design patterns that not only keep storage details abstract, but also encourage data-only or highly managed object states. Great examples of this being release and initialization procedures which in a sense could work as ways of mapping memory. Obviously, this is more of a theoretical or perhaps a design thing, but the ground work is set with well intentioned memory management.<br><br>There's tons of details regarding memory layouts, cache coherence, and proper destruction that aren't necessarily controllable in higher level languages, but object management is one of the things we can do.<br><br>The behavior of the garbage collector honestly depends on the environment you target, so it's hard to say if pooling is required or not, but it definitely gives you a lot more head room when targeting a lot of platforms. Historically, the Android and XNA (C#) targets were the biggest offenders of "GC bloat", where despite being deterministic solutions, they could still cause inconsistent stalls during gameplay.<br><br>Today, this is at least less of an issue; that's definitely the case on higher-end systems, but I definitely feel that the mindset of reducing allocations should still be kept when targeting many platforms.<br><br>To put it simply, if you're just using moderately sized or otherwise small objects, feel free to remove them from collections and forget about them. Anything in the direction of arrays or data-buffers should have some thought put into whether a reallocation should be preferred. There's no manual deletion allowed in Monkey, nor should you try to destruct an object that could still be intently referenced somewhere else. If it's something with a lot of "weight" to it, or something like a game-object you have a lot of control over, it depends on your preferences and debugging practices.<br><br>Here's some similar threads that talk about this sort of subject:<br><b>* <a href="http://www.monkey-x.com/Community/posts.php?topic=9892" target="_blank">Question on Garbage Collection</a><br>* <a href="http://www.monkey-x.com/Community/posts.php?topic=9436" target="_blank">STDCPP GC?</a><br>* <a href="http://www.monkey-x.com/Community/posts.php?topic=9321" target="_blank">Memory Leak?</a></b><br><br>There's some other things I could go into, like how array and stacks are technically better than just using lists, but it's honestly less of a problem these days.

You don't even have to code a pool; use the brl.pool module.<br><br>The general rule of thumb is, you don't want to be calling constructors on a regular basis. If you need to New up some objects occasionally, that's fine, but with bullets you know you're going to have to make more every frame, yet at the same time there are never more than a few at a time. You could code your own solution with an "active" flag, but then you have to search through your list of bullets to find an "inactive" one, which is a huge pain. This is a textbook example of when to use a pool.<br><br>Before you get yourself in trouble, though, it's important to note that there ARE times when you have to think about memory: in Mojo as with most game frameworks, the memory for "resources" are managed differently. You'll notice that images, sounds, and databuffers have a "Discard" method or similar. You need to call these yourself, or the garbage collector won't up that memory and you'll have a leak. The memory used by those sorts of classes is outside the realm of the gc. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
