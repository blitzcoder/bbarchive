I ended up neglecting it, and it only got used in about 3 or 4 of my BMax games.<br>So this time around, I started by building a proper Tracker-style interface for the thing, first.  Usability is the key!<br><br>My first release includes the entire BlitzMax sourcecode for the tracker and player, as well as a simple Monkey sourcecode demo thing that you *should* be able to easily chuck into your own projects.<br><br>It's not AMAZING, it's not even really finished if I'm honest, but it's up to a working standard, so it's good enough for an initial release.<br><br>I'm 100% certain that the code could be better/neater, (I am NOT a neat coder!) and there are a million ways to make the player that much more awesome.  There's also a lack of feedback/info functions, which I'll definitely be adding in later, for "Music Game" type events and things.  Mmmm..<br>But for now it "works", and.. given that I only just started working on this last week, it works pretty darned well!<br><br><a href="http://socoder.net/uploads/1/JMTrackr.zip" target="_blank">JMTracker Download</a><br>Includes<br>.

I really like it. Still trying to figure out the random part of it, but you really created some useful tool here. And I don't think you will use it alone ;-)<br><br>Does it save fine on Windows in all places? On OSX when I try to save it on the desktop, the path is cut somehow and it doesn't save it. If you don't have an OSX system, I can look into this and send you a fix. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

It slices the pathname up to make it easier for lazy coders (ie me) to plonk tunes into their games really quickly without faffing about with folders and things.<br>If you want it to do more, feel free to fiddle about with it, and let me know what you get going on. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

The problem with using one in Monkey is timing. Both the update timing and the sound playback latency are untrustworthy on certain targets. It'll likely work well enough in most circumstances (as long as your code fits the framerate) but needs caution on targets like HTML5 and Android.<br><br>Also, there are obviously issues to be worked around when doing chunky tasks like loading levels if you want music to keep playing while doing it. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
