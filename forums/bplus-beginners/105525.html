But dunno how to start coding, i mean...what structure should i follow?.<br>I think, the first thing to do is initialize the graphics part, but then what?, should i load all the resources i need and then put the gamelogic? should i divide the loadresouces part in one file and the gamelogic in another..? and that is just thinking in a very simple game. I check the code samples, and they are very good for what they do but i dont see how can modify it to my own needs, for example, loading the resources at the very beginning of the code could be good for a arkanoid tipe game with few graphics, but if i made some kind of rpg where you have a lot of images, sounds, etc...is that the best approach?.<br><br>Also, how to create levels or maps for a game? I am starting to believe that i not only should have to create a game, i have to create the editors too.? <br><br>Sorry for the long post, i dont speak english so is hard to me be brief and direct. Hope you understand me.<br><br>I dont see any tutorial pointing to how to approach a game creation (witch i was specting after finish reading the beginners guide...).<br><br>Thnx in advance, i hope someone could pointme in the right direction..<br><br>EDIT: Also forgot to ask...if i have for example a game where the player can manage a spaceship, but in another moment, get down from the ship and walk over a planet or be inside his base. Those three "states" works diferently, is possible/reccomendable doing different codes for each (like differents games) and then merge together, like load "insideship.bb" when is in the ship or load "onfoot.bb" when is not.?. Or is better to make all same time in "continun" code?. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

global gamemode%
const ccharacter% = 1
const cspaceship% = 2
const ccomputer% = 3
gamemode = ccharacter

If( gamemode = ccharacter )

I am organizing my proyect, planning it before write any code so i can go step by step. Also thanks for the gamemode code, i was predicting a future problem with that..LoL, and about the map editors, at the moment, my plans are going to avoid them as much as i can, because if i understand correctly, i should see the format of the files created by those tools and "read it"/ "write it" with my software so it will require a lot more knowledge i have right now -time too-. So, i just will start simple, following your advice, and using separate zones/screens.<br><br>Many thanks again. I'm really excited about all this, i used to create mods for other games -half life, wolfenstein3d, civ2- none of this ever released, but never has the kind of control or creativity freedom as i could have now where there is almost no limit of what can be done. Cheers! <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
