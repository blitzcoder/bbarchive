Just give yourself a quick and rough overview of what's available within the language. Maybe copy some of the code examples there and have a bit of a play with them for the lulz.<br><br>Next you should copy some of the code samples that come with the language download (I'm not sure what samples come with BlitzPlus). Copy and paste the folder that any sample that catches your eye comes in and try running the sample. It may not work out of the box. There may be an external Include that you will need to incorporate directly or replace with a Graphics command. Make sure you also have any media files required for the sample. Modify the code sample in whatever way floats your boat. Play around with it and see if you can turn it into anything interesting. Once you get bored with playing around with a particular sample just see if you can find another one that interests you more.<br><br>Then move on to the code archives on this site. Most of the code there comes with a working example so there's plenty of material to have some fun with. Find a few bits of code that interest you and see if you can turn them into anything interesting. Just focus on having fun with them.<br><br>Different people learn in different ways, but personally the way I learned to code was by actually coding and then browsing the documentation (or asking on the forum) when I hit a problem I didn't have the knowledge to solve. The main thing is to have fun with it.<br><br><font class="tiny">Last edited 2012</font> <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
