So, picture this: work starts on the apartment building, but the player logs off, as does (through a coincidence) every other player. There are no longer any copies of the game running, so the DB stops updating and remains static. So, when a player logs back on, nothing's happened or changed! The very first thing you'll need is a program, always running, that can update the DB even if no one's playing the game. As far as UPDATING the DB goes, I've heard that ETNA works well; check this site's toolbox. <br><br></td></tr></table><br>

Like everything in programming, there are lots of ways to solve this problem but this is how I'd do it :)<br><br>I recommend using a MySQL database server, because it's free and relatively easy to learn. It can take a little bit of effort to get it running, but it saves time later. There are plenty of <a href="http://www.tizag.com/mysqlTutorial/" target="_blank">MySQL Tutorials</a> available online :)<br><br>Once you've got your DB running, it's time to make a server. You can either write the server in Blitz or in another language. Using Blitz has the advantage that you can port a lot of code from the client. However, it's more debugging work later on. Another method would be to use PHP on an Apache web server (the same thing that powers a lot of websites). You lose some speed and Blitz type stuff, but you can get something working fairly rapidly. <br><br>It's really down to personal choice, but my one piece of advice would be to make sure your server logs as much as possible. It'll save you bashing your head during debugging ;)<br><br>Start with something very small to learn the basics. Perhaps a simple map where you can place buildings using the client, and then the server will send a message once they're built (after 20 seconds or something). That'll help you get a grip of some basic stuff, so you can build on that experience to create your game.<br><br>Let me know if I can clarify any of that ;) <br><br></td></tr></table><br>
