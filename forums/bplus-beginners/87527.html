;Here's one of the problems that I've had. I was trying to make it

;up when  the player collides with it. But, the problem is that 
;when the player goes up and gets to a certain proximity to the 
;ORBE, the ORBE goes up at a time when the player HAS NOT 
;collided with it. So thus, I was wondering what am I doing wrong 
;here. Gosh, computers do some strange things...

;here's where another problem lies. Here, I was trying to make it 
;so that the player has to actually get to the ORBE in order
;to push it. But, it won't collide at all even though I put in 
;the "ImagesCollide" command. And once again, when the player 
;pushes the up button, when it gets to a certain PROXIMITY to 
;the ORBE, the ORBE may moves up when the player HASN'T 
;collided with it. Thus, how do I fix this. Thanks
