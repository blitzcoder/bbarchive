Coloured output, so that it looks like code in the IDE - for inclusion in html tutorials.<br>2. Black and White formatted for printing from your web-browser.<br><br>The output is linked to Cascading Style Sheets called Blitz.css and BlitzPrint.css, so you'll need to create these, and put them in the program's folder.  N.B. a Cascading Style Sheet is just a text document with .CSS as the file extension instead of .TXT.  You can copy and paste the examples below into text files and save them as css files.  But if you use the Blitz font in your editor - you'll need to copy it to your Windows/Fonts directory and click refresh in your web-browser before you see it.  You don't need to specify "text-align: left" unless you have other parts of your html that are justified - in which case you do because justified, line-wrapped lines of code look daft - though it's best to insert carriage returns where you think a line of code might wrap at lower resolutions.  If you're not familiar with cascading style sheets, the font-family line looks for the fonts in the order that they appear, and will only look for the next font if it couldn't find the first - so make the first font your preferred font.<br><br>Blitz.css example:<br><br>p.blitz { font-family: blitz, courier, monospace;<br>	color: white;<br>	background-color: #480091;<br>	border: 2px solid #480091;<br>	text-align: left; }<br>.keyword { color: #FFE75F; }<br>.comment { color: #00FFFF; }<br>.textstring { color: #00FF00; }<br><br>BlitzPrint.css example<br><br>p.blitz { font-family: arial;<br>	text-align: left; }<br>.keyword { font-weight: bold; }<br>.comment { font-family: serif; font-style: italic; }<br>.textstring { font-family: monospace, courier; }<br><br>You can change the fonts or colours specified to reflect your own IDE preferences.  Now when you want to create your html, simply change the STYLESHEET$ constant to "Blitz.css" or "BlitzPrint.css".  Sorry - can't remember what the Blitz IDE default colours and font are - these are in the cfg folder of Blitz - which you can open in notepad if you've never looked at them (Blitzide.prefs).  This way, anyone reading your tutorial can alter the fonts and colours in the css to make code examples look more familiar - which is half the battle when trying to read someone else's code.<br><br>Blitz2HTML expects to find a bb file in its own folder called code.bb, which it then converts to code.html and ExecFiles it to your browser.  Keep debugging switched on in case of offset out of range, and increase the HTMLBANKSIZE constant if you do.  Now you can simply copy and paste code into code.bb, save it, and then execute Blitz2HTML.<br><br>Sorry - I couldn't think of a better way of indenting text other than by using non-breaking spaces.  Let me know if you can think of a better way.  The only alternative that I can think of is to use definition lists, but I don't think it's possible to change the indentation amount in a definition list, which would be quite limiting.<br><br>Once executed and opened in your browser you can right-click and select view-source (in Internet Explorer) and then simply copy everything between (not including) the &lt;body&gt; tags for pasting into your own html.  You'll need to add the stylesheet to your web-page by copying the line before &lt;/head&gt; in code.html to the same place in your html, and ensure the stylesheet is in the same folder.<br><br>Or if printing, you can tell your browser not to print headers/footers.  As far as line-wrapping is concerned in the printable version - instead of specifying a text size in the stylesheets, you can simply select View-Text Size-Smaller or Smallest (Internet Explorer) and then do a print preview - since your screen font size settings affect the printed output as well (though you might want to restore the font size to medium after printing).<br><br>If you need to add new/missed Blitz commands to the data statements, simply increase the number of commands for that particular letter, and then put the command in the correct alphabetical order, with the first letter missing - AND with the correct case - since it's case-sensitive.<br><br>Finally, the background colour is changed with the &lt;p class="blitz"&gt; command to start a blitz paragraph&lt;/p&gt;, and keywords comments and textstrings are changed with &lt;span class="keyword"&gt;  and switched off with &lt;/span&gt;.  Html commands like &lt;br&gt; are poked to the htmlbank as single integers holding all four ascii characters - but obviously the bytes are in reverse order.  After looking at the code, you might want to poke the keyword$, comment$, and textstring$ strings to another bank at the start of the program, and then use copybank to insert them into the htmlbank throughout the rest of the code - rather than looping through the strings with Asc(mid$ etc like I did.  This just occurred to me today - and I'll probably do this myself at some point.<br><br>I also wrote a version that puts &lt;b&gt; tags &lt;/b&gt; for keywords in the printable version, instead of &lt;span class="keyword"&gt; keyword &lt;/span&gt; to reduce the output filesize.  You might want to alter the code to do this yourself.<br><br>See the various comments in the code.<br><br>I would have made a zip file of the bb file, css files and html guide available but I don't have internet access at home.<br><br>Current for BlitzPlus 1.44 </td></tr><tr ><td class="cell"><pre class="code">;Blitz Basic 1.8 / BlitzPlus code to HTML
;Harlequin Software 2006/07

;Originally written for Blitz Basic 1.8 - updated for BlitzPlus 30/01/07

;LEAVE DEBUGGING SWITCH ON - IF YOU GET OFFSET OUT OF RANGE ERROR THEN INCREASE
;HTMLBANKSIZE constant

;I've just upgraded to BlitzPlus, and have just added the new commands to
;the data statements below - if however, I've placed some in the wrong alphabetcial order,
;then they may not appear correctly in the final output.  Since I am new to these commands
;I haven't actually written anything that I can test it with, and although I've tested
;a few of the samples that come with BlitzPlus - I don't know the commands well enough
;to spot the non-coloured ones.  I'm sure if you spot errors in your final output, you
;can put them right easily enough though.  Also, Global, EndGraphics and MouseWait were
;not in the Blitz Command List, which I copied for the data statements - and there may
;be others that I don't know about.  Also - HTML commands in the index have uppercase HTML
;but the actual commands don't - I had to alter the data because it is case-sensitive - there
;may be other commands that are not case-correct in the index that I copied.  Finally - FontDescend
;is described as being added in v1.39 - but isn't recognized as a command by the IDE - but I have
;added it to the list of commands in the data statements anyway.
;
;I DON'T HAVE BLITZ 3D - SO DON'T KNOW THE COMMANDS TO ADD
;
;Although BlitzPlus provides access to file-requesters, I prefer
;to use a constant for the bb and html filenames, because when writing a tutorial, it's
;usually just small bits of code that I want to convert, and I can simply paste them
;into code.bb, save it, and then execute this - a file-requester would take longer.
;Besides - I haven't learnt the new BlitzPlus commands for file-requesters and stuff.

I think your Blitz2HTML converter makes it a lot easier for most people to get source listings, with out all of the fuss.<br><br>Since the keywords are in data statements, I suppose it's just a matter of replacing the BlitzPlus keywords with say Blitz3D keywords, or BlitzMax keywords. The only other thing that comes to mind is in the differences in the comment character (apostrophe v.s. semi-colon).<br><br>If using BlitzPlus definitely go with the file requestors, then it's just point and click to select the file to be converted. <br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr ><td class="posthead"><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr ><td >Vic 3 Babes</td><td align="right"><font class=tiny>2007</font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr ><td class="posttext"> Yeah - there is actually an html guide to the code - but obviously I couldn't post it.<br><br>You can simply alter the data statements to add new commands.<br><br>Also, I didn't know about the apostrophe, but all you should have to do is alter the value for the constant SEMICOLON.<br><br>I do think thank using HTML definition lists might be better than non-breaking spaces on reflection - but am still not sure that browsers could handle really big complex structures - will test at some point.<br><br>People can easily alter the code for file-requesters - but I still prefer the constant method, because when writing a tutorial, I copy chunks of the code at one time to explain its purpose, I paste the chunks into code.bb, run it as html, right-click in I.E., select source, and then copy and paste it into my own HTML.<br><br>Glad you found it useful <br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr ><td class="posthead"><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr ><td >Andy_A</td><td align="right"><font class=tiny>2007</font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr ><td class="posttext"> Yeah, I can see how useful this would be for creating tutorials.
